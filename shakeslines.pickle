VSo shaken as we are so wan with care
p1
aVFind we a time for frighted peace to pant
p2
aVAnd breathe short-winded accents of new broils
p3
aVTo be commenced in strands afar remote
p4
aVNo more the thirsty entrance of this soil
p5
aVShall daub her lips with her own children\u2019s blood
p6
aVNo more shall trenching war channel her fields
p7
aVNor bruise her flow\u2019rets with the armèd hoofs
p8
aVOf hostile paces Those opposèd eyes
p9
aVWhich like the meteors of a troubled heaven
p10
aVAll of one nature of one substance bred
p11
aVDid lately meet in the intestine shock
p12
aVAnd furious close of civil butchery
p13
aVShall now in mutual well-beseeming ranks
p14
aVMarch all one way and be no more opposed
p15
aVAgainst acquaintance kindred and allies
p16
aVThe edge of war like an ill-sheathèd knife

aVAs far as to the sepulcher of Christ
p19
aVWhose soldier now under whose blessèd cross
p20
aVWe are impressèd and engaged to fight
p21
aVForthwith a power of English shall we levy
p22
aVWhose arms were molded in their mothers\u2019 womb
p23
aVTo chase these pagans in those holy fields
p24
aVOver whose acres walked those blessèd feet
p25
aVWhich fourteen hundred years ago were nailed
p26
aVFor our advantage on the bitter cross
p27
aVBut this our purpose now is twelve month old
p28
aVAnd bootless \u2019tis to tell you we will go
p29
aVTherefor we meet not now Then let me hear
p30
aVOf you my gentle cousin Westmoreland
p31
aVWhat yesternight our council did decree
p32
aVIn forwarding this dear expedience
p33
aVMy liege this haste was hot in question
p34
aVAnd many limits of the charge set down
p35
aVBut yesternight when all athwart there came
p36
aVA post from Wales loaden with heavy news
p37
aVWhose worst was that the noble Mortimer
p38
aVLeading the men of Herefordshire to fight
p39
aVAgainst the irregular and wild Glendower
p40
aVWas by the rude hands of that Welshman taken
p41
aVA thousand of his people butcherèd
p42
aVUpon whose dead corpse there was such misuse
p43
aVSuch beastly shameless transformation
p44
aVBy those Welshwomen done as may not be
p45
aVWithout much shame retold or spoken of
p46
aVIt seems then that the tidings of this broil
p47
aVBrake off our business for the Holy Land
p48
aVThis matched with other did my gracious lord
p49
aVFor more uneven and unwelcome news
p50
aVCame from the north and thus it did import
p51
aVOn Holy-rood Day the gallant Hotspur there
p52
aVYoung Harry Percy and brave Archibald
p53
aVThat ever valiant and approvèd Scot
p54
aVAt Holmedon met where they did spend
p55
aVA sad and bloody hour
p56
aVAs by discharge of their artillery
p57
aVAnd shape of likelihood the news was told
p58
aVFor he that brought them in the very heat
p59
aVAnd pride of their contention did take horse
p60
aVUncertain of the issue any way
p61
aVHere is a dear a true-industrious friend
p62
aVSir Walter Blunt new lighted from his horse
p63
aVStained with the variation of each soil
p64
aVBetwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours
p65
aVAnd he hath brought us smooth and welcome news
p66
aVThe Earl of Douglas is discomfited
p67
aVTen thousand bold Scots two-and-twenty knights
p68
aVBalked in their own blood did Sir Walter see
p69
aVOn Holmedon\u2019s plains Of prisoners Hotspur took
p70
aVMordake Earl of Fife and eldest son
p71
aVTo beaten Douglas and the Earl of Atholl
p72
aVOf Murray Angus and Menteith
p73
aVAnd is not this an honorable spoil
p74
aVA gallant prize Ha cousin is it not
p75
aVIn faith it is a conquest for a prince to boast of
p76
aVYea there thou mak\u2019st me sad and mak\u2019st me sin
p77
aVIn envy that my Lord Northumberland
p78
aVShould be the father to so blest a son
p79
aVA son who is the theme of Honor\u2019s tongue
p80
aVAmongst a grove the very straightest plant
p81
aVWho is sweet Fortune\u2019s minion and her pride
p82
aVWhilst I by looking on the praise of him
p83
aVSee riot and dishonor stain the brow
p84
aVOf my young Harry O that it could be proved
p85
aVThat some night-tripping fairy had exchanged
p86
aVIn cradle-clothes our children where they lay
p87
aVAnd called mine Percy his Plantagenet
p88
aVThen would I have his Harry and he mine
p89
aVBut let him from my thoughts What think you coz
p90
aVOf this young Percy\u2019s pride The prisoners
p91
aVWhich he in this adventure hath surprised
p92
aVTo his own use he keeps and sends me word
p93
aVI shall have none but Mordake Earl of Fife
p94
aVThis is his uncle\u2019s teaching This is Worcester
p95
aVMalevolent to you in all aspects
p96
aVWhich makes him prune himself and bristle up
p97
aVThe crest of youth against your dignity
p98
aVBut I have sent for him to answer this
p99
aVAnd for this cause awhile we must neglect
p100
aVOur holy purpose to Jerusalem
p101
aVCousin on Wednesday next our council we
p102
aVWill hold at Windsor So inform the lords
p103
aVBut come yourself with speed to us again
p104
aVFor more is to be said and to be done
p105
aVThan out of anger can be utterèd
p106
aVI will my liege
p107
aVI know you all and will awhile uphold
p108
aVThe unyoked humor of your idleness
p109
aVYet herein will I imitate the sun
p110
aVWho doth permit the base contagious clouds
p111
aVTo smother up his beauty from the world
p112
aVThat when he please again to be himself
p113
aVBeing wanted he may be more wondered at
p114
aVBy breaking through the foul and ugly mists
p115
aVOf vapors that did seem to strangle him
p116
aVIf all the year were playing holidays
p117
aVTo sport would be as tedious as to work
p118
aVBut when they seldom come they wished-for come
p119
aVAnd nothing pleaseth but rare accidents
p120
aVSo when this loose behavior I throw off
p121
aVAnd pay the debt I never promisèd
p122
aVBy how much better than my word I am
p123
aVBy so much shall I falsify men\u2019s hopes
p124
aVAnd like bright metal on a sullen ground
p125
aVMy reformation glitt\u2019ring o\u2019er my fault
p126
aVShall show more goodly and attract more eyes
p127
aVThan that which hath no foil to set it off
p128
aVI\u2019ll so offend to make offense a skill
p129
aVRedeeming time when men think least I will
p130
aVMy blood hath been too cold and temperate
p131
aVUnapt to stir at these indignities
p132
aVAnd you have found me for accordingly
p133
aVYou tread upon my patience But be sure
p134
aVI will from henceforth rather be myself
p135
aVMighty and to be feared than my condition
p136
aVWhich hath been smooth as oil soft as young down
p137
aVAnd therefore lost that title of respect
p138
aVWhich the proud soul ne\u2019er pays but to the proud
p139
aVOur house my sovereign liege little deserves
p140
aVThe scourge of greatness to be used on it
p141
aVAnd that same greatness too which our own hands
p142
aVHave holp to make so portly
p143
aVMy lord
p144
aVWorcester get thee gone for I do see
p145
aVDanger and disobedience in thine eye
p146
aVO sir your presence is too bold and peremptory
p147
aVAnd majesty might never yet endure
p148
aVThe moody frontier of a servant brow
p149
aVYou have good leave to leave us When we need
p150
aVYour use and counsel we shall send for you
p151
aVYou were about to speak
p152
aVYea my good lord
p153
aVThose prisoners in your Highness\u2019 name demanded
p154
aVWhich Harry Percy here at Holmedon took
p155
aVWere as he says not with such strength denied
p156
aVAs is delivered to your Majesty
p157
aVEither envy therefore or misprision
p158
aVIs guilty of this fault and not my son
p159
aVMy liege I did deny no prisoners
p160
aVBut I remember when the fight was done
p161
aVWhen I was dry with rage and extreme toil
p162
aVBreathless and faint leaning upon my sword
p163
aVCame there a certain lord neat and trimly dressed
p164
aVFresh as a bridegroom and his chin new reaped
p165
aVShowed like a stubble land at harvest home
p166
aVHe was perfumèd like a milliner
p167
aVAnd \u2019twixt his finger and his thumb he held
p168
aVA pouncet box which ever and anon
p169
aVHe gave his nose and took \u2019t away again
p170
aVWho therewith angry when it next came there
p171
aVTook it in snuff and still he smiled and talked
p172
aVAnd as the soldiers bore dead bodies by
p173
aVHe called them untaught knaves unmannerly
p174
aVTo bring a slovenly unhandsome corse
p175
aVBetwixt the wind and his nobility
p176
aVWith many holiday and lady terms
p177
aVHe questioned me amongst the rest demanded
p178
aVMy prisoners in your Majesty\u2019s behalf
p179
aVI then all smarting with my wounds being cold
p180
aVTo be so pestered with a popinjay
p181
aVOut of my grief and my impatience
p182
aVAnswered neglectingly I know not what
p183
aVHe should or he should not for he made me mad
p184
aVTo see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet
p185
aVAnd talk so like a waiting-gentlewoman
p186
aVOf guns and drums and wounds God save the mark
p187
aVAnd telling me the sovereignest thing on Earth
p188
aVWas parmacety for an inward bruise
p189
aVAnd that it was great pity so it was
p190
aVThis villainous saltpeter should be digged
p191
aVOut of the bowels of the harmless Earth
p192
aVWhich many a good tall fellow had destroyed
p193
aVSo cowardly and but for these vile guns
p194
aVHe would himself have been a soldier
p195
aVThis bald unjointed chat of his my lord
p196
aVI answered indirectly as I said
p197
aVAnd I beseech you let not his report
p198
aVCome current for an accusation
p199
aVBetwixt my love and your high Majesty
p200
aVThe circumstance considered good my lord
p201
aVWhate\u2019er Lord Harry Percy then had said
p202
aVTo such a person and in such a place
p203
aVAt such a time with all the rest retold
p204
aVMay reasonably die and never rise
p205
aVTo do him wrong or any way impeach
p206
aVWhat then he said so he unsay it now
p207
aVWhy yet he doth deny his prisoners
p208
aVBut with proviso and exception
p209
aVThat we at our own charge shall ransom straight
p210
aVHis brother-in-law the foolish Mortimer
p211
aVWho on my soul hath willfully betrayed
p212
aVThe lives of those that he did lead to fight
p213
aVAgainst that great magician damned Glendower
p214
aVWhose daughter as we hear that Earl of March
p215
aVHath lately married Shall our coffers then
p216
aVBe emptied to redeem a traitor home
p217
aVShall we buy treason and indent with fears
p218
aVWhen they have lost and forfeited themselves
p219
aVNo on the barren mountains let him starve
p220
aVFor I shall never hold that man my friend
p221
aVWhose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost
p222
aVTo ransom home revolted Mortimer
p223
aVRevolted Mortimer
p224
aVHe never did fall off my sovereign liege
p225
aVBut by the chance of war To prove that true
p226
aVNeeds no more but one tongue for all those wounds
p227
aVThose mouthèd wounds which valiantly he took
p228
aVWhen on the gentle Severn\u2019s sedgy bank
p229
aVIn single opposition hand to hand
p230
aVHe did confound the best part of an hour
p231
aVIn changing hardiment with great Glendower
p232
aVThree times they breathed and three times did they drink
p233
aVUpon agreement of swift Severn\u2019s flood
p234
aVWho then affrighted with their bloody looks
p235
aVRan fearfully among the trembling reeds
p236
aVAnd hid his crisp head in the hollow bank
p237
aVBlood-stainèd with these valiant combatants
p238
aVNever did bare and rotten policy
p239
aVColor her working with such deadly wounds
p240
aVNor never could the noble Mortimer
p241
aVReceive so many and all willingly
p242
aVThen let not him be slandered with revolt
p243
aVThou dost belie him Percy thou dost belie him
p244
aVHe never did encounter with Glendower
p245
aVI tell thee he durst as well have met the devil alone
p246
aVAs Owen Glendower for an enemy
p247
aVArt thou not ashamed But sirrah henceforth
p248
aVLet me not hear you speak of Mortimer
p249
aVSend me your prisoners with the speediest means
p250
aVOr you shall hear in such a kind from me
p251
aVAs will displease you My lord Northumberland
p252
aVWe license your departure with your son
p253
aVSend us your prisoners or you will hear of it
p254
aVAn if the devil come and roar for them
p255
aVI will not send them I will after straight
p256
aVAnd tell him so for I will ease my heart
p257
aVAlbeit I make a hazard of my head
p258
aVWhat drunk with choler Stay and pause awhile
p259
aVHere comes your uncle
p260
aVSpeak of Mortimer
p261
aVZounds I will speak of him and let my soul
p262
aVWant mercy if I do not join with him
p263
aVYea on his part I\u2019ll empty all these veins
p264
aVAnd shed my dear blood drop by drop in the dust
p265
aVBut I will lift the downtrod Mortimer
p266
aVAs high in the air as this unthankful king
p267
aVAs this ingrate and cankered Bolingbroke
p268
aVBrother the King hath made your nephew mad
p269
aVWho struck this heat up after I was gone
p270
aVHe will forsooth have all my prisoners
p271
aVAnd when I urged the ransom once again
p272
aVOf my wife\u2019s brother then his cheek looked pale
p273
aVAnd on my face he turned an eye of death
p274
aVTrembling even at the name of Mortimer
p275
aVI cannot blame him Was not he proclaimed
p276
aVBy Richard that dead is the next of blood
p277
aVHe was I heard the proclamation
p278
aVAnd then it was when the unhappy king
p279
aVWhose wrongs in us God pardon did set forth
p280
aVUpon his Irish expedition
p281
aVFrom whence he intercepted did return
p282
aVTo be deposed and shortly murderèd
p283
aVAnd for whose death we in the world\u2019s wide mouth
p284
aVLive scandalized and foully spoken of
p285
aVBut soft I pray you Did King Richard then
p286
aVProclaim my brother Edmund Mortimer
p287
aVHeir to the crown
p288
aVHe did myself did hear it
p289
aVNay then I cannot blame his cousin king
p290
aVThat wished him on the barren mountains starve
p291
aVBut shall it be that you that set the crown
p292
aVUpon the head of this forgetful man
p293
aVAnd for his sake wear the detested blot
p294
aVOf murderous subornation shall it be
p295
aVThat you a world of curses undergo
p296
aVBeing the agents or base second means
p297
aVThe cords the ladder or the hangman rather
p298
aVO pardon me that I descend so low
p299
aVTo show the line and the predicament
p300
aVWherein you range under this subtle king
p301
aVShall it for shame be spoken in these days
p302
aVOr fill up chronicles in time to come
p303
aVThat men of your nobility and power
p304
aVDid gage them both in an unjust behalf
p305
aVAs both of you God pardon it have done
p306
aVTo put down Richard that sweet lovely rose
p307
aVAnd plant this thorn this canker Bolingbroke
p308
aVAnd shall it in more shame be further spoken
p309
aVThat you are fooled discarded and shook off
p310
aVBy him for whom these shames you underwent
p311
aVNo yet time serves wherein you may redeem
p312
aVYour banished honors and restore yourselves
p313
aVInto the good thoughts of the world again
p314
aVRevenge the jeering and disdained contempt
p315
aVOf this proud king who studies day and night
p316
aVTo answer all the debt he owes to you
p317
aVEven with the bloody payment of your deaths
p318
aVTherefore I say
p319
aVPeace cousin say no more
p320
aVAnd now I will unclasp a secret book
p321
aVAnd to your quick-conceiving discontents
p322
aVI\u2019ll read you matter deep and dangerous
p323
aVAs full of peril and adventurous spirit
p324
aVAs to o\u2019erwalk a current roaring loud
p325
aVOn the unsteadfast footing of a spear
p326
aVIf he fall in good night or sink or swim
p327
aVSend danger from the east unto the west
p328
aVSo honor cross it from the north to south
p329
aVAnd let them grapple O the blood more stirs
p330
aVTo rouse a lion than to start a hare
p331
aVImagination of some great exploit
p332
aVDrives him beyond the bounds of patience
p333
aVBy heaven methinks it were an easy leap
p334
aVTo pluck bright honor from the pale-faced moon
p335
aVOr dive into the bottom of the deep
p336
aVWhere fathom line could never touch the ground
p337
aVAnd pluck up drownèd honor by the locks
p338
aVSo he that doth redeem her thence might wear
p339
aVWithout corrival all her dignities
p340
aVBut out upon this half-faced fellowship
p341
aVHe apprehends a world of figures here
p342
aVBut not the form of what he should attend
p343
aVGood cousin give me audience for a while
p344
aVI cry you mercy
p345
aVThose same noble Scots
p346
aVThat are your prisoners
p347
aVI\u2019ll keep them all
p348
aVBy God he shall not have a Scot of them
p349
aVNo if a Scot would save his soul he shall not
p350
aVI\u2019ll keep them by this hand
p351
aVYou start away
p352
aVAnd lend no ear unto my purposes
p353
aVThose prisoners you shall keep
p354
aVNay I will That\u2019s flat
p355
aVHe said he would not ransom Mortimer
p356
aVForbade my tongue to speak of Mortimer
p357
aVBut I will find him when he lies asleep
p358
aVAnd in his ear I\u2019ll hollo Mortimer
p359
aVNay I\u2019ll have a starling shall be taught to speak
p360
aVNothing but Mortimer and give it him
p361
aVTo keep his anger still in motion
p362
aVHear you cousin a word
p363
aVAll studies here I solemnly defy
p364
aVSave how to gall and pinch this Bolingbroke
p365
aVAnd that same sword-and-buckler Prince of Wales
p366
aVBut that I think his father loves him not
p367
aVAnd would be glad he met with some mischance
p368
aVI would have him poisoned with a pot of ale
p369
aVFarewell kinsman I\u2019ll talk to you
p370
aVWhen you are better tempered to attend
p371
aVWhy what a wasp-stung and impatient fool
p372
aVArt thou to break into this woman\u2019s mood
p373
aVTying thine ear to no tongue but thine own
p374
aVWhy look you I am whipped and scourged with rods
p375
aVNettled and stung with pismires when I hear
p376
aVOf this vile politician Bolingbroke
p377
aVIn Richard\u2019s time what do you call the place
p378
aVA plague upon it It is in Gloucestershire
p379
aV\u2019Twas where the madcap duke his uncle kept
p380
aVHis uncle York where I first bowed my knee
p381
aVUnto this king of smiles this Bolingbroke
p382
aV\u2019Sblood when you and he came back from Ravenspurgh
p383
aVAt Berkeley Castle
p384
aVYou say true
p385
aVWhy what a candy deal of courtesy
p386
aVThis fawning greyhound then did proffer me
p387
aVLook when his infant fortune came to age
p388
aVAnd gentle Harry Percy and kind cousin
p389
aVO the devil take such cozeners God forgive me
p390
aVGood uncle tell your tale I have done
p391
aVNay if you have not to it again
p392
aVWe will stay your leisure
p393
aVI have done i\u2019 faith
p394
aVThen once more to your Scottish prisoners
p395
aVDeliver them up without their ransom straight
p396
aVAnd make the Douglas\u2019 son your only mean
p397
aVFor powers in Scotland which for divers reasons
p398
aVWhich I shall send you written be assured
p399
aVWill easily be granted You my lord
p400
aVYour son in Scotland being thus employed
p401
aVShall secretly into the bosom creep
p402
aVOf that same noble prelate well beloved
p403
aVThe Archbishop
p404
aVOf York is it not
p405
aVTrue who bears hard
p406
aVHis brother\u2019s death at Bristol the Lord Scroop
p407
aVI speak not this in estimation
p408
aVAs what I think might be but what I know
p409
aVIs ruminated plotted and set down
p410
aVAnd only stays but to behold the face
p411
aVOf that occasion that shall bring it on
p412
aVI smell it Upon my life it will do well
p413
aVBefore the game is afoot thou still let\u2019st slip
p414
aVWhy it cannot choose but be a noble plot
p415
aVAnd then the power of Scotland and of York
p416
aVTo join with Mortimer ha
p417
aVAnd so they shall
p418
aVIn faith it is exceedingly well aimed
p419
aVAnd \u2019tis no little reason bids us speed
p420
aVTo save our heads by raising of a head
p421
aVFor bear ourselves as even as we can
p422
aVThe King will always think him in our debt
p423
aVAnd think we think ourselves unsatisfied
p424
aVTill he hath found a time to pay us home
p425
aVAnd see already how he doth begin
p426
aVTo make us strangers to his looks of love
p427
aVHe does he does We\u2019ll be revenged on him
p428
aVCousin farewell No further go in this
p429
aVThan I by letters shall direct your course
p430
aVWhen time is ripe which will be suddenly
p431
aVI\u2019ll steal to Glendower and Lord Mortimer
p432
aVWhere you and Douglas and our powers at once
p433
aVAs I will fashion it shall happily meet
p434
aVTo bear our fortunes in our own strong arms
p435
aVWhich now we hold at much uncertainty
p436
aVFarewell good brother We shall thrive I trust
p437
aVUncle adieu O let the hours be short
p438
aVTill fields and blows and groans applaud our sport
p439
aVGot with much ease Now merrily to horse
p440
aVThe thieves are all scattered and possessed with fear
p441
aVSo strongly that they dare not meet each other

aVWhy dost thou bend thine eyes upon the earth

aVWhy hast thou lost the fresh blood in thy cheeks
p454
aVAnd given my treasures and my rights of thee
p455
aVTo thick-eyed musing and curst melancholy
p456
aVIn thy faint slumbers I by thee have watched

p466
aVAnd thus hath so bestirred thee in thy sleep
p467
aVThat beads of sweat have stood upon thy brow
p468
aVLike bubbles in a late-disturbèd stream
p469
aVAnd in thy face strange motions have appeared
p470
aVSuch as we see when men restrain their breath

aVAs oft as Lancaster doth speak of you

aVHis cheek looks pale and with a rising sigh
p563
aVHe wisheth you in heaven
p564
aVAnd you in hell
p565
aVAs oft as he hears Owen Glendower spoke of
p566
aVI cannot blame him At my nativity
p567
aVThe front of heaven was full of fiery shapes
p568
aVOf burning cressets and at my birth
p569
aVThe frame and huge foundation of the Earth
p570
aVShaked like a coward
p571
aVWhy so it would have done
p572
aVAt the same season if your mother\u2019s cat
p573
aVHad but kittened though yourself had never been born
p574
aVI say the Earth did shake when I was born
p575
aVAnd I say the Earth was not of my mind
p576
aVIf you suppose as fearing you it shook
p577
aVThe heavens were all on fire the Earth did tremble
p578
aVO then the Earth shook to see the heavens on fire
p579
aVAnd not in fear of your nativity
p580
aVDiseasèd nature oftentimes breaks forth
p581
aVIn strange eruptions oft the teeming Earth
p582
aVIs with a kind of colic pinched and vexed
p583
aVBy the imprisoning of unruly wind
p584
aVWithin her womb which for enlargement striving
p585
aVShakes the old beldam Earth and topples down
p586
aVSteeples and moss-grown towers At your birth
p587
aVOur grandam Earth having this distemp\u2019rature
p588
aVIn passion shook
p589
aVCousin of many men
p590
aVI do not bear these crossings Give me leave
p591
aVTo tell you once again that at my birth
p592
aVThe front of heaven was full of fiery shapes
p593
aVThe goats ran from the mountains and the herds
p594
aVWere strangely clamorous to the frighted fields
p595
aVThese signs have marked me extraordinary
p596
aVAnd all the courses of my life do show
p597
aVI am not in the roll of common men
p598
aVWhere is he living clipped in with the sea
p599
aVThat chides the banks of England Scotland Wales
p600
aVWhich calls me pupil or hath read to me
p601
aVAnd bring him out that is but woman\u2019s son
p602
aVCan trace me in the tedious ways of art
p603
aVAnd hold me pace in deep experiments
p604
aVI think there\u2019s no man speaks better Welsh
p605
aVI\u2019ll to dinner
p606
aVPeace cousin Percy You will make him mad
p607
aVI can call spirits from the vasty deep
p608
aVWhy so can I or so can any man
p609
aVBut will they come when you do call for them
p610
aVWhy I can teach you cousin to command the devil
p611
aVAnd I can teach thee coz to shame the devil
p612
aVBy telling truth Tell truth and shame the devil
p613
aVIf thou have power to raise him bring him hither
p614
aVAnd I\u2019ll be sworn I have power to shame him hence
p615
aVO while you live tell truth and shame the devil
p616
aVCome come no more of this unprofitable chat
p617
aVThree times hath Henry Bolingbroke made head
p618
aVAgainst my power thrice from the banks of Wye
p619
aVAnd sandy-bottomed Severn have I sent him
p620
aVBootless home and weather-beaten back
p621
aVHome without boots and in foul weather too
p622
aVHow \u2019scapes he agues in the devil\u2019s name
p623
aVCome here is the map Shall we divide our right
p624
aVAccording to our threefold order ta\u2019en
p625
aVThe Archdeacon hath divided it
p626
aVInto three limits very equally
p627
aVEngland from Trent and Severn hitherto
p628
aVBy south and east is to my part assigned
p629
aVAll westward Wales beyond the Severn shore
p630
aVAnd all the fertile land within that bound
p631
aVTo Owen Glendower and dear coz to you
p632
aVThe remnant northward lying off from Trent
p633
aVAnd our indentures tripartite are drawn
p634
aVWhich being sealèd interchangeably
p635
aVA business that this night may execute
p636
aVTomorrow cousin Percy you and I
p637
aVAnd my good Lord of Worcester will set forth
p638
aVTo meet your father and the Scottish power
p639
aVAs is appointed us at Shrewsbury
p640
aVMy father Glendower is not ready yet
p641
aVNor shall we need his help these fourteen days
p642
aVTo Glendower Within that space you may have drawn together
p643
aVYour tenants friends and neighboring gentlemen
p644
aVA shorter time shall send me to you lords
p645
aVAnd in my conduct shall your ladies come
p646
aVFrom whom you now must steal and take no leave
p647
aVFor there will be a world of water shed
p648
aVUpon the parting of your wives and you
p649
aVMethinks my moiety north from Burton here
p650
aVIn quantity equals not one of yours
p651
aVSee how this river comes me cranking in
p652
aVAnd cuts me from the best of all my land
p653
aVA huge half-moon a monstrous cantle out
p654
aVI\u2019ll have the current in this place dammed up
p655
aVAnd here the smug and silver Trent shall run
p656
aVIn a new channel fair and evenly
p657
aVIt shall not wind with such a deep indent
p658
aVTo rob me of so rich a bottom here
p659
aVNot wind It shall it must You see it doth
p660
aVYea but mark how he bears his course and runs me up
p661
aVWith like advantage on the other side
p662
aVGelding the opposèd continent as much
p663
aVAs on the other side it takes from you
p664
aVYea but a little charge will trench him here
p665
aVAnd on this north side win this cape of land
p666
aVAnd then he runs straight and even
p667
aVI\u2019ll have it so A little charge will do it
p668
aVI\u2019ll not have it altered
p669
aVWill not you
p670
aVNo nor you shall not
p671
aVWho shall say me nay
p672
aVWhy that will I
p673
aVLet me not understand you then speak it in Welsh
p674
aVI can speak English lord as well as you
p675
aVFor I was trained up in the English court
p676
aVWhere being but young I framèd to the harp
p677
aVMany an English ditty lovely well
p678
aVAnd gave the tongue a helpful ornament
p679
aVA virtue that was never seen in you
p680
aVMarry and I am glad of it with all my heart
p681
aVI had rather be a kitten and cry mew
p682
aVThan one of these same meter balladmongers
p683
aVI had rather hear a brazen can\u2019stick turned
p684
aVOr a dry wheel grate on the axletree
p685
aVAnd that would set my teeth nothing an edge
p686
aVNothing so much as mincing poetry
p687
aV\u2019Tis like the forced gait of a shuffling nag
p688
aVCome you shall have Trent turned
p689
aVI do not care I\u2019ll give thrice so much land
p690
aVTo any well-deserving friend
p691
aVBut in the way of bargain mark you me
p692
aVI\u2019ll cavil on the ninth part of a hair
p693
aVAre the indentures drawn Shall we be gone
p694
aVThe moon shines fair You may away by night
p695
aVI\u2019ll haste the writer and withal
p696
aVBreak with your wives of your departure hence
p697
aVI am afraid my daughter will run mad
p698
aVSo much she doteth on her Mortimer
p699
aVFie cousin Percy how you cross my father
p700
aVI cannot choose Sometime he angers me
p701
aVWith telling me of the moldwarp and the ant
p702
aVOf the dreamer Merlin and his prophecies
p703
aVAnd of a dragon and a finless fish
p704
aVA clip-winged griffin and a moulten raven
p705
aVA couching lion and a ramping cat
p706
aVAnd such a deal of skimble-skamble stuff
p707
aVAs puts me from my faith I tell you what
p708
aVHe held me last night at least nine hours
p709
aVIn reckoning up the several devils\u2019 names
p710
aVThat were his lackeys I cried Hum and Well go to
p711
aVBut marked him not a word O he is as tedious
p712
aVAs a tired horse a railing wife
p713
aVWorse than a smoky house I had rather live
p714
aVWith cheese and garlic in a windmill far
p715
aVThan feed on cates and have him talk to me
p716
aVIn any summer house in Christendom
p717
aVIn faith he is a worthy gentleman
p718
aVExceedingly well read and profited
p719
aVIn strange concealments valiant as a lion
p720
aVAnd wondrous affable and as bountiful
p721
aVAs mines of India Shall I tell you cousin
p722
aVHe holds your temper in a high respect
p723
aVAnd curbs himself even of his natural scope
p724
aVWhen you come cross his humor Faith he does
p725
aVI warrant you that man is not alive
p726
aVMight so have tempted him as you have done
p727
aVWithout the taste of danger and reproof
p728
aVBut do not use it oft let me entreat you
p729
aVIn faith my lord you are too willful-blame
p730
aVAnd since your coming hither have done enough
p731
aVTo put him quite besides his patience
p732
aVYou must needs learn lord to amend this fault
p733
aVThough sometimes it show greatness courage blood
p734
aVAnd that\u2019s the dearest grace it renders you
p735
aVYet oftentimes it doth present harsh rage
p736
aVDefect of manners want of government
p737
aVPride haughtiness opinion and disdain
p738
aVThe least of which haunting a nobleman
p739
aVLoseth men\u2019s hearts and leaves behind a stain
p740
aVUpon the beauty of all parts besides
p741
aVBeguiling them of commendation
p742
aVWell I am schooled Good manners be your speed
p743
aVHere come our wives and let us take our leave
p744
aVThis is the deadly spite that angers me
p745
aVMy wife can speak no English I no Welsh
p746
aVMy daughter weeps she\u2019ll not part with you
p747
aVShe\u2019ll be a soldier too she\u2019ll to the wars
p748
aVGood father tell her that she and my aunt Percy
p749
aVShall follow in your conduct speedily
p750
aVShe is desperate here a peevish self-willed harlotry
p751
aVOne that no persuasion can do good upon
p752
aVI understand thy looks That pretty Welsh
p753
aVWhich thou pourest down from these swelling heavens
p754
aVI am too perfect in and but for shame
p755
aVIn such a parley should I answer thee
p756
aVI understand thy kisses and thou mine
p757
aVAnd that\u2019s a feeling disputation
p758
aVBut I will never be a truant love
p759
aVTill I have learned thy language for thy tongue
p760
aVMakes Welsh as sweet as ditties highly penned
p761
aVSung by a fair queen in a summer\u2019s bower
p762
aVWith ravishing division to her lute
p763
aVNay if you melt then will she run mad
p764
aVO I am ignorance itself in this
p765
aVShe bids you on the wanton rushes lay you down
p766
aVAnd rest your gentle head upon her lap
p767
aVAnd she will sing the song that pleaseth you
p768
aVAnd on your eyelids crown the god of sleep
p769
aVCharming your blood with pleasing heaviness
p770
aVMaking such difference \u2019twixt wake and sleep
p771
aVAs is the difference betwixt day and night
p772
aVThe hour before the heavenly harnessed team
p773
aVBegins his golden progress in the east
p774
aVWith all my heart I\u2019ll sit and hear her sing
p775
aVBy that time will our book I think be drawn
p776
aVDo so and those musicians that shall play to you
p777
aVHang in the air a thousand leagues from hence
p778
aVAnd straight they shall be here Sit and attend
p779
aVCome Kate thou art perfect in lying down
p780
aVCome quick quick that I may lay my head in thy lap
p781
aVGo you giddy goose
p782
aVNow I perceive the devil understands Welsh
p783
aVAnd \u2019tis no marvel he is so humorous
p784
aVBy \u2019r Lady he is a good musician
p785
aVAnd givest such sarcenet surety for thy oaths
p786
aVAs if thou never walk\u2019st further than Finsbury
p787
aVSwear me Kate like a lady as thou art
p788
aVA good mouth-filling oath and leave in sooth
p789
aVAnd such protest of pepper-gingerbread
p790
aVTo velvet-guards and Sunday citizens
p791
aVCome sing
p792
aVCome come Lord Mortimer you are as slow
p793
aVAs hot Lord Percy is on fire to go
p794
aVBy this our book is drawn We\u2019ll but seal
p795
aVAnd then to horse immediately
p796
aVWith all my heart
p797
aVLords give us leave the Prince of Wales and I
p798
aVMust have some private conference but be near at hand
p799
aVFor we shall presently have need of you
p800
aVI know not whether God will have it so
p801
aVFor some displeasing service I have done
p802
aVThat in His secret doom out of my blood
p803
aVHe\u2019ll breed revengement and a scourge for me
p804
aVBut thou dost in thy passages of life
p805
aVMake me believe that thou art only marked
p806
aVFor the hot vengeance and the rod of heaven
p807
aVTo punish my mistreadings Tell me else
p808
aVCould such inordinate and low desires
p809
aVSuch poor such bare such lewd such mean attempts
p810
aVSuch barren pleasures rude society
p811
aVAs thou art matched withal and grafted to
p812
aVAccompany the greatness of thy blood
p813
aVAnd hold their level with thy princely heart
p814
aVSo please your Majesty I would I could
p815
aVQuit all offenses with as clear excuse
p816
aVAs well as I am doubtless I can purge
p817
aVMyself of many I am charged withal
p818
aVYet such extenuation let me beg
p819
aVAs in reproof of many tales devised
p820
aVWhich oft the ear of greatness needs must hear
p821
aVBy smiling pickthanks and base newsmongers
p822
aVI may for some things true wherein my youth
p823
aVHath faulty wandered and irregular
p824
aVFind pardon on my true submission
p825
aVGod pardon thee Yet let me wonder Harry
p826
aVAt thy affections which do hold a wing
p827
aVQuite from the flight of all thy ancestors
p828
aVThy place in council thou hast rudely lost
p829
aVWhich by thy younger brother is supplied
p830
aVAnd art almost an alien to the hearts
p831
aVOf all the court and princes of my blood
p832
aVThe hope and expectation of thy time
p833
aVIs ruined and the soul of every man
p834
aVProphetically do forethink thy fall
p835
aVHad I so lavish of my presence been
p836
aVSo common-hackneyed in the eyes of men
p837
aVSo stale and cheap to vulgar company
p838
aVOpinion that did help me to the crown
p839
aVHad still kept loyal to possession
p840
aVAnd left me in reputeless banishment
p841
aVA fellow of no mark nor likelihood
p842
aVBy being seldom seen I could not stir
p843
aVBut like a comet I was wondered at
p844
aVThat men would tell their children This is he
p845
aVOthers would say Where Which is Bolingbroke
p846
aVAnd then I stole all courtesy from heaven
p847
aVAnd dressed myself in such humility
p848
aVThat I did pluck allegiance from men\u2019s hearts
p849
aVLoud shouts and salutations from their mouths
p850
aVEven in the presence of the crownèd king
p851
aVThus did I keep my person fresh and new
p852
aVMy presence like a robe pontifical
p853
aVNe\u2019er seen but wondered at and so my state
p854
aVSeldom but sumptuous showed like a feast
p855
aVAnd won by rareness such solemnity
p856
aVThe skipping king he ambled up and down
p857
aVWith shallow jesters and rash bavin wits
p858
aVSoon kindled and soon burnt carded his state
p859
aVMingled his royalty with cap\u2019ring fools
p860
aVHad his great name profanèd with their scorns
p861
aVAnd gave his countenance against his name
p862
aVTo laugh at gibing boys and stand the push
p863
aVOf every beardless vain comparative
p864
aVGrew a companion to the common streets
p865
aVEnfeoffed himself to popularity
p866
aVThat being daily swallowed by men\u2019s eyes
p867
aVThey surfeited with honey and began
p868
aVTo loathe the taste of sweetness whereof a little
p869
aVMore than a little is by much too much
p870
aVSo when he had occasion to be seen
p871
aVHe was but as the cuckoo is in June
p872
aVHeard not regarded seen but with such eyes
p873
aVAs sick and blunted with community
p874
aVAfford no extraordinary gaze
p875
aVSuch as is bent on sunlike majesty
p876
aVWhen it shines seldom in admiring eyes
p877
aVBut rather drowsed and hung their eyelids down
p878
aVSlept in his face and rendered such aspect
p879
aVAs cloudy men use to their adversaries
p880
aVBeing with his presence glutted gorged and full
p881
aVAnd in that very line Harry standest thou
p882
aVFor thou hast lost thy princely privilege
p883
aVWith vile participation Not an eye
p884
aVBut is aweary of thy common sight
p885
aVSave mine which hath desired to see thee more
p886
aVWhich now doth that I would not have it do
p887
aVMake blind itself with foolish tenderness
p888
aVI shall hereafter my thrice gracious lord
p889
aVBe more myself
p890
aVFor all the world
p891
aVAs thou art to this hour was Richard then
p892
aVWhen I from France set foot at Ravenspurgh
p893
aVAnd even as I was then is Percy now
p894
aVNow by my scepter and my soul to boot
p895
aVHe hath more worthy interest to the state
p896
aVThan thou the shadow of succession
p897
aVFor of no right nor color like to right
p898
aVHe doth fill fields with harness in the realm
p899
aVTurns head against the lion\u2019s armèd jaws
p900
aVAnd being no more in debt to years than thou
p901
aVLeads ancient lords and reverend bishops on
p902
aVTo bloody battles and to bruising arms
p903
aVWhat never-dying honor hath he got
p904
aVAgainst renownèd Douglas whose high deeds
p905
aVWhose hot incursions and great name in arms
p906
aVHolds from all soldiers chief majority
p907
aVAnd military title capital
p908
aVThrough all the kingdoms that acknowledge Christ
p909
aVThrice hath this Hotspur Mars in swaddling clothes
p910
aVThis infant warrior in his enterprises
p911
aVDiscomfited great Douglas ta\u2019en him once
p912
aVEnlargèd him and made a friend of him
p913
aVTo fill the mouth of deep defiance up
p914
aVAnd shake the peace and safety of our throne
p915
aVAnd what say you to this Percy Northumberland
p916
aVThe Archbishop\u2019s Grace of York Douglas Mortimer
p917
aVCapitulate against us and are up
p918
aVBut wherefore do I tell these news to thee
p919
aVWhy Harry do I tell thee of my foes
p920
aVWhich art my nearest and dearest enemy
p921
aVThou that art like enough through vassal fear
p922
aVBase inclination and the start of spleen
p923
aVTo fight against me under Percy\u2019s pay
p924
aVTo dog his heels and curtsy at his frowns
p925
aVTo show how much thou art degenerate
p926
aVDo not think so You shall not find it so
p927
aVAnd God forgive them that so much have swayed
p928
aVYour Majesty\u2019s good thoughts away from me
p929
aVI will redeem all this on Percy\u2019s head
p930
aVAnd in the closing of some glorious day
p931
aVBe bold to tell you that I am your son
p932
aVWhen I will wear a garment all of blood
p933
aVAnd stain my favors in a bloody mask
p934
aVWhich washed away shall scour my shame with it
p935
aVAnd that shall be the day whene\u2019er it lights
p936
aVThat this same child of honor and renown
p937
aVThis gallant Hotspur this all-praisèd knight
p938
aVAnd your unthought-of Harry chance to meet
p939
aVFor every honor sitting on his helm
p940
aVWould they were multitudes and on my head
p941
aVMy shames redoubled For the time will come
p942
aVThat I shall make this northern youth exchange
p943
aVHis glorious deeds for my indignities
p944
aVPercy is but my factor good my lord
p945
aVTo engross up glorious deeds on my behalf
p946
aVAnd I will call him to so strict account
p947
aVThat he shall render every glory up
p948
aVYea even the slightest worship of his time
p949
aVOr I will tear the reckoning from his heart
p950
aVThis in the name of God I promise here
p951
aVThe which if He be pleased I shall perform
p952
aVI do beseech your Majesty may salve
p953
aVThe long-grown wounds of my intemperance
p954
aVIf not the end of life cancels all bands
p955
aVAnd I will die a hundred thousand deaths
p956
aVEre break the smallest parcel of this vow
p957
aVA hundred thousand rebels die in this
p958
aVThou shalt have charge and sovereign trust herein
p959
aVHow now good Blunt Thy looks are full of speed
p960
aVSo hath the business that I come to speak of
p961
aVLord Mortimer of Scotland hath sent word
p962
aVThat Douglas and the English rebels met

aVO I could wish this tavern were my drum
p990
aVWell said my noble Scot If speaking truth
p991
aVIn this fine age were not thought flattery
p992
aVSuch attribution should the Douglas have
p993
aVAs not a soldier of this season\u2019s stamp
p994
aVShould go so general current through the world
p995
aVBy God I cannot flatter I do defy
p996
aVThe tongues of soothers But a braver place

aVIn my heart\u2019s love hath no man than yourself

aVNay task me to my word approve me lord
p999
aVThou art the king of honor

aVBut I will beard him
p1002
aVDo so and \u2019tis well
p1003
aVWhat letters hast thou there To Douglas I can but thank you
p1004
aVThese letters come from your father
p1005
aVLetters from him Why comes he not himself
p1006
aVHe cannot come my lord He is grievous sick
p1007
aVZounds how has he the leisure to be sick
p1008
aVIn such a justling time Who leads his power
p1009
aVUnder whose government come they along
p1010
aVHis letters bears his mind not I my lord
p1011
aVI prithee tell me doth he keep his bed
p1012
aVHe did my lord four days ere I set forth
p1013
aVAnd at the time of my departure thence
p1014
aVHe was much feared by his physicians
p1015
aVI would the state of time had first been whole
p1016
aVEre he by sickness had been visited
p1017
aVHis health was never better worth than now
p1018
aVSick now Droop now This sickness doth infect
p1019
aVThe very lifeblood of our enterprise
p1020
aV\u2019Tis catching hither even to our camp
p1021
aVHe writes me here that inward sickness
p1022
aVAnd that his friends by deputation
p1023
aVCould not so soon be drawn nor did he think it meet
p1024
aVTo lay so dangerous and dear a trust
p1025
aVOn any soul removed but on his own
p1026
aVYet doth he give us bold advertisement
p1027
aVThat with our small conjunction we should on
p1028
aVTo see how fortune is disposed to us
p1029
aVFor as he writes there is no quailing now
p1030
aVBecause the King is certainly possessed
p1031
aVOf all our purposes What say you to it
p1032
aVYour father\u2019s sickness is a maim to us
p1033
aVA perilous gash a very limb lopped off
p1034
aVAnd yet in faith it is not His present want
p1035
aVSeems more than we shall find it Were it good
p1036
aVTo set the exact wealth of all our states
p1037
aVAll at one cast To set so rich a main
p1038
aVOn the nice hazard of one doubtful hour
p1039
aVIt were not good for therein should we read
p1040
aVThe very bottom and the soul of hope
p1041
aVThe very list the very utmost bound
p1042
aVOf all our fortunes
p1043
aVFaith and so we should where now remains
p1044
aVA sweet reversion We may boldly spend
p1045
aVUpon the hope of what is to come in
p1046
aVA comfort of retirement lives in this
p1047
aVA rendezvous a home to fly unto
p1048
aVIf that the devil and mischance look big
p1049
aVUpon the maidenhead of our affairs
p1050
aVBut yet I would your father had been here
p1051
aVThe quality and hair of our attempt
p1052
aVBrooks no division It will be thought
p1053
aVBy some that know not why he is away
p1054
aVThat wisdom loyalty and mere dislike
p1055
aVOf our proceedings kept the Earl from hence
p1056
aVAnd think how such an apprehension
p1057
aVMay turn the tide of fearful faction
p1058
aVAnd breed a kind of question in our cause
p1059
aVFor well you know we of the off\u2019ring side
p1060
aVMust keep aloof from strict arbitrament
p1061
aVAnd stop all sight-holes every loop from whence
p1062
aVThe eye of reason may pry in upon us
p1063
aVThis absence of your father\u2019s draws a curtain
p1064
aVThat shows the ignorant a kind of fear
p1065
aVBefore not dreamt of
p1066
aVYou strain too far
p1067
aVI rather of his absence make this use
p1068
aVIt lends a luster and more great opinion
p1069
aVA larger dare to our great enterprise
p1070
aVThan if the Earl were here for men must think
p1071
aVIf we without his help can make a head
p1072
aVTo push against a kingdom with his help
p1073
aVWe shall o\u2019erturn it topsy-turvy down
p1074
aVYet all goes well yet all our joints are whole
p1075
aVAs heart can think There is not such a word
p1076
aVSpoke of in Scotland as this term of fear
p1077
aVMy cousin Vernon welcome by my soul

aVPray God my news be worth a welcome lord

aVI saw young Harry with his beaver on
p1098
aVHis cuisses on his thighs gallantly armed
p1099
aVRise from the ground like feathered Mercury
p1100
aVAnd vaulted with such ease into his seat
p1101
aVAs if an angel dropped down from the clouds
p1102
aVTo turn and wind a fiery Pegasus
p1103
aVAnd witch the world with noble horsemanship
p1104
aVNo more no more Worse than the sun in March
p1105
aVThis praise doth nourish agues Let them come
p1106
aVThey come like sacrifices in their trim
p1107
aVAnd to the fire-eyed maid of smoky war
p1108
aVAll hot and bleeding will we offer them
p1109
aVThe mailèd Mars shall on his altar sit

aVWhat may the King\u2019s whole battle reach unto
p1124
aVTo thirty thousand

aVFits a dull fighter and a keen guest

aVSo do we

aVHis is certain ours is doubtful

aVGood cousin be advised Stir not tonight

aVYou do not counsel well
p1144
aVYou speak it out of fear and cold heart

p1147
aVIf well-respected honor bid me on

aVIn general journey-bated and brought low

aVThe better part of ours are full of rest
p1167
aVThe number of the King exceedeth ours

aVI come with gracious offers from the King
p1170
aVIf you vouchsafe me hearing and respect
p1171
aVWelcome Sir Walter Blunt and would to God
p1172
aVYou were of our determination
p1173
aVSome of us love you well and even those some
p1174
aVEnvy your great deservings and good name
p1175
aVBecause you are not of our quality
p1176
aVBut stand against us like an enemy
p1177
aVAnd God defend but still I should stand so
p1178
aVSo long as out of limit and true rule
p1179
aVYou stand against anointed majesty
p1180
aVBut to my charge The King hath sent to know
p1181
aVThe nature of your griefs and whereupon
p1182
aVYou conjure from the breast of civil peace
p1183
aVSuch bold hostility teaching his duteous land
p1184
aVAudacious cruelty If that the King
p1185
aVHave any way your good deserts forgot
p1186
aVWhich he confesseth to be manifold
p1187
aVHe bids you name your griefs and with all speed
p1188
aVYou shall have your desires with interest
p1189
aVAnd pardon absolute for yourself and these
p1190
aVHerein misled by your suggestion
p1191
aVThe King is kind and well we know the King
p1192
aVKnows at what time to promise when to pay
p1193
aVMy father and my uncle and myself
p1194
aVDid give him that same royalty he wears
p1195
aVAnd when he was not six-and-twenty strong
p1196
aVSick in the world\u2019s regard wretched and low
p1197
aVA poor unminded outlaw sneaking home
p1198
aVMy father gave him welcome to the shore
p1199
aVAnd when he heard him swear and vow to God
p1200
aVHe came but to be Duke of Lancaster
p1201
aVTo sue his livery and beg his peace
p1202
aVWith tears of innocency and terms of zeal
p1203
aVMy father in kind heart and pity moved
p1204
aVSwore him assistance and performed it too
p1205
aVNow when the lords and barons of the realm
p1206
aVPerceived Northumberland did lean to him
p1207
aVThe more and less came in with cap and knee
p1208
aVMet him in boroughs cities villages
p1209
aVAttended him on bridges stood in lanes
p1210
aVLaid gifts before him proffered him their oaths
p1211
aVGave him their heirs as pages followed him
p1212
aVEven at the heels in golden multitudes
p1213
aVHe presently as greatness knows itself
p1214
aVSteps me a little higher than his vow
p1215
aVMade to my father while his blood was poor
p1216
aVUpon the naked shore at Ravenspurgh
p1217
aVAnd now forsooth takes on him to reform
p1218
aVSome certain edicts and some strait decrees
p1219
aVThat lie too heavy on the commonwealth
p1220
aVCries out upon abuses seems to weep
p1221
aVOver his country\u2019s wrongs and by this face
p1222
aVThis seeming brow of justice did he win
p1223
aVThe hearts of all that he did angle for
p1224
aVProceeded further cut me off the heads
p1225
aVOf all the favorites that the absent king
p1226
aVIn deputation left behind him here
p1227
aVWhen he was personal in the Irish war
p1228
aVTut I came not to hear this
p1229
aVThen to the point
p1230
aVIn short time after he deposed the King
p1231
aVSoon after that deprived him of his life
p1232
aVAnd in the neck of that tasked the whole state
p1233
aVTo make that worse suffered his kinsman March
p1234
aVWho is if every owner were well placed
p1235
aVIndeed his king to be engaged in Wales
p1236
aVThere without ransom to lie forfeited
p1237
aVDisgraced me in my happy victories
p1238
aVSought to entrap me by intelligence
p1239
aVRated mine uncle from the council board
p1240
aVIn rage dismissed my father from the court
p1241
aVBroke oath on oath committed wrong on wrong
p1242
aVAnd in conclusion drove us to seek out
p1243
aVThis head of safety and withal to pry
p1244
aVInto his title the which we find
p1245
aVToo indirect for long continuance
p1246
aVShall I return this answer to the King
p1247
aVNot so Sir Walter We\u2019ll withdraw awhile
p1248
aVGo to the King and let there be impawned
p1249
aVSome surety for a safe return again
p1250
aVAnd in the morning early shall mine uncle
p1251
aVBring him our purposes And so farewell
p1252
aVI would you would accept of grace and love
p1253
aVAnd maybe so we shall
p1254
aVPray God you do
p1255
aVHie good Sir Michael bear this sealèd brief
p1256
aVWith wingèd haste to the Lord Marshal
p1257
aVThis to my cousin Scroop and all the rest
p1258
aVTo whom they are directed If you knew
p1259
aVHow much they do import you would make haste
p1260
aVMy good lord I guess their tenor
p1261
aVLike enough you do
p1262
aVTomorrow good Sir Michael is a day
p1263
aVWherein the fortune of ten thousand men
p1264
aVMust bide the touch For sir at Shrewsbury
p1265
aVAs I am truly given to understand
p1266
aVThe King with mighty and quick-raisèd power
p1267
aVMeets with Lord Harry And I fear Sir Michael
p1268
aVWhat with the sickness of Northumberland
p1269
aVWhose power was in the first proportion
p1270
aVAnd what with Owen Glendower\u2019s absence thence
p1271
aVWho with them was a rated sinew too
p1272
aVAnd comes not in o\u2019erruled by prophecies
p1273
aVI fear the power of Percy is too weak
p1274
aVTo wage an instant trial with the King
p1275
aVWhy my good lord you need not fear
p1276
aVThere is Douglas and Lord Mortimer
p1277
aVNo Mortimer is not there
p1278
aVBut there is Mordake Vernon Lord Harry Percy
p1279
aVAnd there is my Lord of Worcester and a head
p1280
aVOf gallant warriors noble gentlemen
p1281
aVAnd so there is But yet the King hath drawn
p1282
aVThe special head of all the land together
p1283
aVThe Prince of Wales Lord John of Lancaster
p1284
aVThe noble Westmoreland and warlike Blunt
p1285
aVAnd many more corrivals and dear men
p1286
aVOf estimation and command in arms
p1287
aVDoubt not my lord they shall be well opposed
p1288
aVI hope no less yet needful \u2019tis to fear
p1289
aVAnd to prevent the worst Sir Michael speed
p1290
aVFor if Lord Percy thrive not ere the King
p1291
aVDismiss his power he means to visit us
p1292
aVFor he hath heard of our confederacy
p1293
aVAnd \u2019tis but wisdom to make strong against him
p1294
aVTherefore make haste I must go write again
p1295
aVTo other friends And so farewell Sir Michael
p1296
aVHow bloodily the sun begins to peer
p1297
aVAbove yon bulky hill The day looks pale
p1298
aVAt his distemp\u2019rature
p1299
aVThe southern wind
p1300
aVDoth play the trumpet to his purposes
p1301
aVAnd by his hollow whistling in the leaves
p1302
aVForetells a tempest and a blust\u2019ring day
p1303
aVThen with the losers let it sympathize
p1304
aVFor nothing can seem foul to those that win
p1305
aVHow now my Lord of Worcester \u2019Tis not well
p1306
aVThat you and I should meet upon such terms
p1307
aVAs now we meet You have deceived our trust
p1308
aVAnd made us doff our easy robes of peace
p1309
aVTo crush our old limbs in ungentle steel
p1310
aVThis is not well my lord this is not well
p1311
aVWhat say you to it Will you again unknit
p1312
aVThis churlish knot of all-abhorrèd war
p1313
aVAnd move in that obedient orb again
p1314
aVWhere you did give a fair and natural light
p1315
aVAnd be no more an exhaled meteor
p1316
aVA prodigy of fear and a portent
p1317
aVOf broachèd mischief to the unborn times
p1318
aVHear me my liege
p1319
aVFor mine own part I could be well content
p1320
aVTo entertain the lag end of my life
p1321
aVWith quiet hours For I protest
p1322
aVI have not sought the day of this dislike
p1323
aVYou have not sought it How comes it then
p1324
aVRebellion lay in his way and he found it
p1325
aVPeace chewet peace
p1326
aVIt pleased your Majesty to turn your looks
p1327
aVOf favor from myself and all our house
p1328
aVAnd yet I must remember you my lord
p1329
aVWe were the first and dearest of your friends
p1330
aVFor you my staff of office did I break
p1331
aVIn Richard\u2019s time and posted day and night
p1332
aVTo meet you on the way and kiss your hand
p1333
aVWhen yet you were in place and in account
p1334
aVNothing so strong and fortunate as I
p1335
aVIt was myself my brother and his son
p1336
aVThat brought you home and boldly did outdare
p1337
aVThe dangers of the time You swore to us
p1338
aVAnd you did swear that oath at Doncaster
p1339
aVThat you did nothing purpose \u2019gainst the state
p1340
aVNor claim no further than your new-fall\u2019n right
p1341
aVThe seat of Gaunt dukedom of Lancaster
p1342
aVTo this we swore our aid But in short space
p1343
aVIt rained down fortune show\u2019ring on your head
p1344
aVAnd such a flood of greatness fell on you
p1345
aVWhat with our help what with the absent king
p1346
aVWhat with the injuries of a wanton time
p1347
aVThe seeming sufferances that you had borne
p1348
aVAnd the contrarious winds that held the King
p1349
aVSo long in his unlucky Irish wars
p1350
aVThat all in England did repute him dead
p1351
aVAnd from this swarm of fair advantages
p1352
aVYou took occasion to be quickly wooed
p1353
aVTo gripe the general sway into your hand
p1354
aVForgot your oath to us at Doncaster
p1355
aVAnd being fed by us you used us so
p1356
aVAs that ungentle gull the cuckoo\u2019s bird
p1357
aVUseth the sparrow did oppress our nest
p1358
aVGrew by our feeding to so great a bulk
p1359
aVThat even our love durst not come near your sight
p1360
aVFor fear of swallowing but with nimble wing
p1361
aVWe were enforced for safety sake to fly
p1362
aVOut of your sight and raise this present head
p1363
aVWhereby we stand opposèd by such means
p1364
aVAs you yourself have forged against yourself
p1365
aVBy unkind usage dangerous countenance
p1366
aVAnd violation of all faith and troth
p1367
aVSworn to us in your younger enterprise
p1368
aVThese things indeed you have articulate
p1369
aVProclaimed at market crosses read in churches
p1370
aVTo face the garment of rebellion
p1371
aVWith some fine color that may please the eye
p1372
aVOf fickle changelings and poor discontents
p1373
aVWhich gape and rub the elbow at the news
p1374
aVOf hurlyburly innovation
p1375
aVAnd never yet did insurrection want
p1376
aVSuch water colors to impaint his cause
p1377
aVNor moody beggars starving for a time
p1378
aVOf pellmell havoc and confusion
p1379
aVIn both your armies there is many a soul
p1380
aVShall pay full dearly for this encounter
p1381
aVIf once they join in trial Tell your nephew
p1382
aVThe Prince of Wales doth join with all the world
p1383
aVIn praise of Henry Percy By my hopes
p1384
aVThis present enterprise set off his head
p1385
aVI do not think a braver gentleman
p1386
aVMore active-valiant or more valiant-young
p1387
aVMore daring or more bold is now alive
p1388
aVTo grace this latter age with noble deeds
p1389
aVFor my part I may speak it to my shame
p1390
aVI have a truant been to chivalry
p1391
aVAnd so I hear he doth account me too
p1392
aVYet this before my father\u2019s majesty
p1393
aVI am content that he shall take the odds
p1394
aVOf his great name and estimation
p1395
aVAnd will to save the blood on either side
p1396
aVTry fortune with him in a single fight
p1397
aVAnd Prince of Wales so dare we venture thee
p1398
aVAlbeit considerations infinite
p1399
aVDo make against it No good Worcester no
p1400
aVWe love our people well even those we love
p1401
aVThat are misled upon your cousin\u2019s part
p1402
aVAnd will they take the offer of our grace
p1403
aVBoth he and they and you yea every man
p1404
aVShall be my friend again and I\u2019ll be his
p1405
aVSo tell your cousin and bring me word
p1406
aVWhat he will do But if he will not yield
p1407
aVRebuke and dread correction wait on us
p1408
aVAnd they shall do their office So begone
p1409
aVWe will not now be troubled with reply
p1410
aVWe offer fair Take it advisedly
p1411
aVIt will not be accepted on my life
p1412
aVThe Douglas and the Hotspur both together
p1413
aVAre confident against the world in arms
p1414
aVHence therefore every leader to his charge
p1415
aVFor on their answer will we set on them
p1416
aVAnd God befriend us as our cause is just
p1417
aVO no my nephew must not know Sir Richard
p1418
aVThe liberal and kind offer of the King
p1419
aV\u2019Twere best he did
p1420
aVThen are we all undone
p1421
aVIt is not possible it cannot be
p1422
aVThe King should keep his word in loving us
p1423
aVHe will suspect us still and find a time
p1424
aVTo punish this offense in other faults
p1425
aVSuspicion all our lives shall be stuck full of eyes
p1426
aVFor treason is but trusted like the fox
p1427
aVWho never so tame so cherished and locked up
p1428
aVWill have a wild trick of his ancestors
p1429
aVLook how we can or sad or merrily
p1430
aVInterpretation will misquote our looks
p1431
aVAnd we shall feed like oxen at a stall
p1432
aVThe better cherished still the nearer death
p1433
aVMy nephew\u2019s trespass may be well forgot
p1434
aVIt hath the excuse of youth and heat of blood
p1435
aVAnd an adopted name of privilege
p1436
aVA harebrained Hotspur governed by a spleen
p1437
aVAll his offenses live upon my head
p1438
aVAnd on his father\u2019s We did train him on
p1439
aVAnd his corruption being ta\u2019en from us
p1440
aVWe as the spring of all shall pay for all
p1441
aVTherefore good cousin let not Harry know
p1442
aVIn any case the offer of the King
p1443
aVDeliver what you will I\u2019ll say \u2019tis so
p1444
aVHere comes your cousin
p1445
aVMy uncle is returned
p1446
aVDeliver up my Lord of Westmoreland
p1447
aVUncle what news
p1448
aVThe King will bid you battle presently
p1449
aVDefy him by the Lord of Westmoreland
p1450
aVLord Douglas go you and tell him so
p1451
aVMarry and shall and very willingly
p1452
aVThere is no seeming mercy in the King
p1453
aVDid you beg any God forbid
p1454
aVI told him gently of our grievances
p1455
aVOf his oath-breaking which he mended thus
p1456
aVBy now forswearing that he is forsworn
p1457
aVHe calls us rebels traitors and will scourge
p1458
aVWith haughty arms this hateful name in us
p1459
aVArm gentlemen to arms For I have thrown
p1460
aVA brave defiance in King Henry\u2019s teeth
p1461
aVAnd Westmoreland that was engaged did bear it
p1462
aVWhich cannot choose but bring him quickly on
p1463
aVThe Prince of Wales stepped forth before the King
p1464
aVAnd nephew challenged you to single fight
p1465
aVO would the quarrel lay upon our heads
p1466
aVAnd that no man might draw short breath today
p1467
aVBut I and Harry Monmouth Tell me tell me
p1468
aVHow showed his tasking Seemed it in contempt
p1469
aVNo by my soul I never in my life
p1470
aVDid hear a challenge urged more modestly
p1471
aVUnless a brother should a brother dare
p1472
aVTo gentle exercise and proof of arms
p1473
aVHe gave you all the duties of a man
p1474
aVTrimmed up your praises with a princely tongue
p1475
aVSpoke your deservings like a chronicle
p1476
aVMaking you ever better than his praise
p1477
aVBy still dispraising praise valued with you
p1478
aVAnd which became him like a prince indeed
p1479
aVHe made a blushing cital of himself
p1480
aVAnd chid his truant youth with such a grace
p1481
aVAs if he mastered there a double spirit
p1482
aVOf teaching and of learning instantly
p1483
aVThere did he pause but let me tell the world
p1484
aVIf he outlive the envy of this day
p1485
aVEngland did never owe so sweet a hope
p1486
aVSo much misconstrued in his wantonness
p1487
aVCousin I think thou art enamorèd
p1488
aVOn his follies Never did I hear
p1489
aVOf any prince so wild a liberty
p1490
aVBut be he as he will yet once ere night
p1491
aVI will embrace him with a soldier\u2019s arm
p1492
aVThat he shall shrink under my courtesy
p1493
aVArm arm with speed and fellows soldiers friends
p1494
aVBetter consider what you have to do
p1495
aVThan I that have not well the gift of tongue
p1496
aVCan lift your blood up with persuasion
p1497
aVMy lord here are letters for you
p1498
aVI cannot read them now
p1499
aVO gentlemen the time of life is short
p1500
aVTo spend that shortness basely were too long
p1501
aVIf life did ride upon a dial\u2019s point
p1502
aVStill ending at the arrival of an hour
p1503
aVAn if we live we live to tread on kings
p1504
aVIf die brave death when princes die with us
p1505
aVNow for our consciences the arms are fair
p1506
aVWhen the intent of bearing them is just
p1507
aVMy lord prepare The King comes on apace
p1508

p1509
aVFor I profess not talking Only this

aVLet each man do his best And here draw I a sword
p1511

p1521
aVUpon my head

aVBecause some tell me that thou art a king

aVThey tell thee true
p1526
aVThe Lord of Stafford dear today hath bought
p1527
aVThy likeness for instead of thee King Harry

aVUnless thou yield thee as my prisoner

aVThe King hath many marching in his coats
p1545
aVNow by my sword I will kill all his coats

aVOur duty this way lies For God\u2019s sake come

p1623
aVTwo stars keep not their motion in one sphere

aVBears not alive so stout a gentleman
p1650
aVIf thou wert sensible of courtesy
p1651
aVI should not make so dear a show of zeal
p1652
aVBut let my favors hide thy mangled face

aVThe fortune of the day quite turned from him
p1703
aVThe noble Percy slain and all his men

aVTut holy Joan was his defensive guard

aVDidst thou at first to flatter us withal

aVThat now our loss might be ten times so much
p2380
aVWherefore is Charles impatient with his friend

aVAt all times will you have my power alike

aVHad all your quarters been as safely kept
p2390
aVAs that whereof I had the government
p2391
aVWe had not been thus shamefully surprised
p2392
aVMine was secure

aVAnd so was mine my lord

aVAnd for myself most part of all this night
p2395
aVWithin her quarter and mine own precinct
p2396
aVI was employed in passing to and fro
p2397
aVAbout relieving of the sentinels
p2398
aVThen how or which way should they first break in
p2399
aVQuestion my lords no further of the case
p2400
aVHow or which way \u2019tis sure they found some place
p2401
aVBut weakly guarded where the breach was made
p2402
aVAnd now there rests no other shift but this
p2403
aVTo gather our soldiers scattered and dispersed
p2404
aVAnd lay new platforms to endamage them
p2405
aVI\u2019ll be so bold to take what they have left
p2406
aVThe cry of Talbot serves me for a sword
p2407
aVFor I have loaden me with many spoils

aVWhose pitchy mantle over-veiled the Earth

aVNow have I paid my vow unto his soul
p2416
aVFor every drop of blood was drawn from him

aVThere hath at least five Frenchmen died tonight
p2418
aVAnd that hereafter ages may behold
p2419
aVWhat ruin happened in revenge of him
p2420
aVWithin their chiefest temple I\u2019ll erect
p2421
aVA tomb wherein his corpse shall be interred
p2422
aVUpon the which that everyone may read
p2423
aVShall be engraved the sack of Orleance
p2424
aVThe treacherous manner of his mournful death
p2425
aVAnd what a terror he had been to France
p2426
aVBut lords in all our bloody massacre
p2427
aVI muse we met not with the Dauphin\u2019s grace
p2428
aVHis new-come champion virtuous Joan of Arc
p2429
aVNor any of his false confederates
p2430
aV\u2019Tis thought Lord Talbot when the fight began
p2431
aVRoused on the sudden from their drowsy beds
p2432
aVThey did amongst the troops of armèd men
p2433
aVLeap o\u2019er the walls for refuge in the field
p2434
aVMyself as far as I could well discern
p2435
aVFor smoke and dusky vapors of the night
p2436
aVAm sure I scared the Dauphin and his trull
p2437
aVWhen arm-in-arm they both came swiftly running
p2438
aVLike to a pair of loving turtledoves
p2439
aVThat could not live asunder day or night
p2440
aVAfter that things are set in order here
p2441
aVWe\u2019ll follow them with all the power we have

aVPrisoner To whom
p2504
aVTo me bloodthirsty lord
p2505
aVAnd for that cause I trained thee to my house
p2506
aVLong time thy shadow hath been thrall to me
p2507
aVFor in my gallery thy picture hangs
p2508
aVBut now the substance shall endure the like
p2509
aVAnd I will chain these legs and arms of thine
p2510
aVThat hast by tyranny these many years
p2511
aVWasted our country slain our citizens
p2512
aVAnd sent our sons and husbands captivate
p2513
aVHa ha ha
p2514
aVLaughest thou wretch Thy mirth shall turn to moan
p2515
aVI laugh to see your Ladyship so fond
p2516
aVTo think that you have aught but Talbot\u2019s shadow
p2517
aVWhereon to practice your severity
p2518
aVWhy art not thou the man
p2519
aVI am indeed
p2520
aVThen have I substance too
p2521
aVNo no I am but shadow of myself
p2522
aVYou are deceived my substance is not here
p2523
aVFor what you see is but the smallest part
p2524
aVAnd least proportion of humanity
p2525
aVI tell you madam were the whole frame here
p2526
aVIt is of such a spacious lofty pitch
p2527
aVYour roof were not sufficient to contain \u2019t
p2528
aVThis is a riddling merchant for the nonce
p2529
aVHe will be here and yet he is not here
p2530
aVHow can these contrarieties agree
p2531
aVThat will I show you presently
p2532
aVHow say you madam Are you now persuaded
p2533
aVThat Talbot is but shadow of himself
p2534
aVThese are his substance sinews arms and strength
p2535
aVWith which he yoketh your rebellious necks
p2536
aVRazeth your cities and subverts your towns
p2537
aVAnd in a moment makes them desolate
p2538
aVVictorious Talbot pardon my abuse
p2539
aVI find thou art no less than fame hath bruited
p2540
aVAnd more than may be gathered by thy shape
p2541
aVLet my presumption not provoke thy wrath
p2542
aVFor I am sorry that with reverence
p2543
aVI did not entertain thee as thou art
p2544
aVBe not dismayed fair lady nor misconster
p2545
aVThe mind of Talbot as you did mistake
p2546
aVThe outward composition of his body
p2547
aVWhat you have done hath not offended me
p2548
aVNor other satisfaction do I crave
p2549
aVBut only with your patience that we may
p2550
aVTaste of your wine and see what cates you have
p2551
aVFor soldiers\u2019 stomachs always serve them well
p2552
aVWith all my heart and think me honorèd
p2553
aVTo feast so great a warrior in my house
p2554
aVGreat lords and gentlemen what means this silence
p2555
aVDare no man answer in a case of truth
p2556
aVWithin the Temple Hall we were too loud
p2557
aVThe garden here is more convenient
p2558
aVThen say at once if I maintained the truth
p2559
aVOr else was wrangling Somerset in th\u2019 error
p2560
aVFaith I have been a truant in the law
p2561
aVAnd never yet could frame my will to it
p2562
aVAnd therefore frame the law unto my will
p2563
aVJudge you my Lord of Warwick then between us
p2564
aVBetween two hawks which flies the higher pitch
p2565
aVBetween two dogs which hath the deeper mouth
p2566
aVBetween two blades which bears the better temper
p2567
aVBetween two horses which doth bear him best
p2568
aVBetween two girls which hath the merriest eye
p2569
aVI have perhaps some shallow spirit of judgment
p2570
aVBut in these nice sharp quillets of the law
p2571
aVGood faith I am no wiser than a daw
p2572
aVTut tut here is a mannerly forbearance
p2573
aVThe truth appears so naked on my side
p2574
aVThat any purblind eye may find it out
p2575
aVAnd on my side it is so well appareled
p2576
aVSo clear so shining and so evident
p2577
aVThat it will glimmer through a blind man\u2019s eye
p2578
aVSince you are tongue-tied and so loath to speak
p2579
aVIn dumb significants proclaim your thoughts
p2580
aVLet him that is a trueborn gentleman
p2581
aVAnd stands upon the honor of his birth
p2582
aVIf he suppose that I have pleaded truth
p2583
aVFrom off this brier pluck a white rose with me
p2584
aVLet him that is no coward nor no flatterer
p2585
aVBut dare maintain the party of the truth
p2586
aVPluck a red rose from off this thorn with me
p2587
aVI love no colors and without all color
p2588
aVOf base insinuating flattery
p2589
aVI pluck this white rose with Plantagenet
p2590
aVI pluck this red rose with young Somerset
p2591
aVAnd say withal I think he held the right
p2592
aVStay lords and gentlemen and pluck no more
p2593
aVTill you conclude that he upon whose side
p2594
aVThe fewest roses are croppèd from the tree
p2595
aVShall yield the other in the right opinion
p2596
aVGood Master Vernon it is well objected
p2597
aVIf I have fewest I subscribe in silence
p2598
aVAnd I
p2599
aVThen for the truth and plainness of the case
p2600
aVI pluck this pale and maiden blossom here
p2601
aVGiving my verdict on the white rose side
p2602
aVPrick not your finger as you pluck it off
p2603
aVLest bleeding you do paint the white rose red
p2604
aVAnd fall on my side so against your will
p2605
aVIf I my lord for my opinion bleed
p2606
aVOpinion shall be surgeon to my hurt
p2607
aVAnd keep me on the side where still I am
p2608
aVWell well come on who else
p2609
aVUnless my study and my books be false
p2610
aVThe argument you held was wrong in law
p2611
aVIn sign whereof I pluck a white rose too
p2612
aVNow Somerset where is your argument
p2613
aVHere in my scabbard meditating that
p2614
aVShall dye your white rose in a bloody red
p2615
aVMeantime your cheeks do counterfeit our roses
p2616
aVFor pale they look with fear as witnessing
p2617
aVThe truth on our side
p2618
aVNo Plantagenet
p2619
aV\u2019Tis not for fear but anger that thy cheeks
p2620
aVBlush for pure shame to counterfeit our roses
p2621
aVAnd yet thy tongue will not confess thy error
p2622
aVHath not thy rose a canker Somerset
p2623
aVHath not thy rose a thorn Plantagenet
p2624
aVAy sharp and piercing to maintain his truth
p2625
aVWhiles thy consuming canker eats his falsehood
p2626
aVWell I\u2019ll find friends to wear my bleeding roses
p2627
aVThat shall maintain what I have said is true
p2628
aVWhere false Plantagenet dare not be seen
p2629
aVNow by this maiden blossom in my hand
p2630
aVI scorn thee and thy fashion peevish boy
p2631
aVTurn not thy scorns this way Plantagenet
p2632
aVProud Pole I will and scorn both him and thee
p2633
aVI\u2019ll turn my part thereof into thy throat
p2634
aVAway away good William de la Pole
p2635
aVWe grace the yeoman by conversing with him
p2636
aVNow by God\u2019s will thou wrong\u2019st him Somerset
p2637
aVHis grandfather was Lionel Duke of Clarence
p2638
aVThird son to the third Edward King of England
p2639
aVSpring crestless yeomen from so deep a root
p2640
aVHe bears him on the place\u2019s privilege
p2641
aVOr durst not for his craven heart say thus
p2642
aVBy Him that made me I\u2019ll maintain my words
p2643
aVOn any plot of ground in Christendom
p2644
aVWas not thy father Richard Earl of Cambridge
p2645
aVFor treason executed in our late king\u2019s days
p2646
aVAnd by his treason stand\u2019st not thou attainted
p2647
aVCorrupted and exempt from ancient gentry
p2648
aVHis trespass yet lives guilty in thy blood
p2649
aVAnd till thou be restored thou art a yeoman
p2650
aVMy father was attachèd not attainted
p2651
aVCondemned to die for treason but no traitor
p2652
aVAnd that I\u2019ll prove on better men than Somerset
p2653
aVWere growing time once ripened to my will
p2654
aVFor your partaker Pole and you yourself
p2655
aVI\u2019ll note you in my book of memory
p2656
aVTo scourge you for this apprehension
p2657
aVLook to it well and say you are well warned
p2658
aVAh thou shalt find us ready for thee still
p2659
aVAnd know us by these colors for thy foes
p2660
aVFor these my friends in spite of thee shall wear
p2661
aVAnd by my soul this pale and angry rose
p2662
aVAs cognizance of my blood-drinking hate
p2663
aVWill I forever and my faction wear
p2664
aVUntil it wither with me to my grave
p2665
aVOr flourish to the height of my degree
p2666
aVGo forward and be choked with thy ambition
p2667
aVAnd so farewell until I meet thee next
p2668
aVHave with thee Pole Farewell ambitious Richard
p2669
aVHow I am braved and must perforce endure it
p2670
aVThis blot that they object against your house
p2671
aVShall be whipped out in the next parliament
p2672
aVCalled for the truce of Winchester and Gloucester
p2673
aVAnd if thou be not then created York
p2674
aVI will not live to be accounted Warwick
p2675
aVMeantime in signal of my love to thee
p2676
aVAgainst proud Somerset and William Pole
p2677
aVWill I upon thy party wear this rose
p2678
aVAnd here I prophesy this brawl today
p2679
aVGrown to this faction in the Temple garden
p2680
aVShall send between the red rose and the white
p2681
aVA thousand souls to death and deadly night
p2682
aVGood Master Vernon I am bound to you
p2683
aVThat you on my behalf would pluck a flower
p2684
aVIn your behalf still will I wear the same
p2685
aVAnd so will I
p2686
aVThanks gentle sir
p2687
aVCome let us four to dinner I dare say
p2688
aVThis quarrel will drink blood another day
p2689
aVKind keepers of my weak decaying age
p2690
aVLet dying Mortimer here rest himself
p2691
aVEven like a man new-halèd from the rack
p2692
aVSo fare my limbs with long imprisonment
p2693
aVAnd these gray locks the pursuivants of death
p2694
aVNestor-like agèd in an age of care
p2695
aVArgue the end of Edmund Mortimer
p2696
aVThese eyes like lamps whose wasting oil is spent
p2697
aVWax dim as drawing to their exigent
p2698
aVWeak shoulders overborne with burdening grief
p2699
aVAnd pithless arms like to a withered vine
p2700
aVThat droops his sapless branches to the ground
p2701
aVYet are these feet whose strengthless stay is numb
p2702
aVUnable to support this lump of clay
p2703
aVSwift-wingèd with desire to get a grave
p2704
aVAs witting I no other comfort have
p2705
aVBut tell me keeper will my nephew come
p2706
aVRichard Plantagenet my lord will come
p2707
aVWe sent unto the Temple unto his chamber
p2708
aVAnd answer was returned that he will come
p2709
aVEnough My soul shall then be satisfied
p2710
aVPoor gentleman his wrong doth equal mine
p2711
aVSince Henry Monmouth first began to reign
p2712
aVBefore whose glory I was great in arms
p2713
aVThis loathsome sequestration have I had
p2714
aVAnd even since then hath Richard been obscured
p2715
aVDeprived of honor and inheritance
p2716
aVBut now the arbitrator of despairs
p2717
aVJust Death kind umpire of men\u2019s miseries
p2718
aVWith sweet enlargement doth dismiss me hence
p2719
aVI would his troubles likewise were expired
p2720
aVThat so he might recover what was lost
p2721
aVMy lord your loving nephew now is come
p2722
aVRichard Plantagenet my friend is he come
p2723
aVAy noble uncle thus ignobly used
p2724
aVYour nephew late despisèd Richard comes
p2725
aVDirect mine arms I may embrace his neck
p2726
aVAnd in his bosom spend my latter gasp
p2727
aVO tell me when my lips do touch his cheeks
p2728
aVThat I may kindly give one fainting kiss
p2729
aVAnd now declare sweet stem from York\u2019s great stock
p2730
aVWhy didst thou say of late thou wert despised
p2731
aVFirst lean thine agèd back against mine arm
p2732
aVAnd in that ease I\u2019ll tell thee my disease
p2733
aVThis day in argument upon a case
p2734
aVSome words there grew \u2019twixt Somerset and me
p2735
aVAmong which terms he used his lavish tongue
p2736
aVAnd did upbraid me with my father\u2019s death
p2737
aVWhich obloquy set bars before my tongue
p2738
aVElse with the like I had requited him
p2739
aVTherefore good uncle for my father\u2019s sake
p2740
aVIn honor of a true Plantagenet
p2741
aVAnd for alliance\u2019 sake declare the cause
p2742
aVMy father Earl of Cambridge lost his head
p2743
aVThat cause fair nephew that imprisoned me
p2744
aVAnd hath detained me all my flow\u2019ring youth
p2745
aVWithin a loathsome dungeon there to pine
p2746
aVWas cursèd instrument of his decease
p2747
aVDiscover more at large what cause that was
p2748
aVFor I am ignorant and cannot guess
p2749
aVI will if that my fading breath permit
p2750
aVAnd death approach not ere my tale be done
p2751
aVHenry the Fourth grandfather to this king
p2752
aVDeposed his nephew Richard Edward\u2019s son
p2753
aVThe first begotten and the lawful heir
p2754
aVOf Edward king the third of that descent
p2755
aVDuring whose reign the Percies of the north
p2756
aVFinding his usurpation most unjust
p2757
aVEndeavored my advancement to the throne
p2758
aVThe reason moved these warlike lords to this
p2759
aVWas for that young Richard thus removed
p2760
aVLeaving no heir begotten of his body
p2761
aVI was the next by birth and parentage
p2762
aVFor by my mother I derivèd am
p2763
aVFrom Lionel Duke of Clarence third son
p2764
aVTo King Edward the Third whereas he
p2765
aVFrom John of Gaunt doth bring his pedigree
p2766
aVBeing but fourth of that heroic line
p2767
aVBut mark as in this haughty great attempt
p2768
aVThey laborèd to plant the rightful heir
p2769
aVI lost my liberty and they their lives
p2770
aVLong after this when Henry the Fifth
p2771
aVSucceeding his father Bolingbroke did reign
p2772
aVThy father Earl of Cambridge then derived
p2773
aVFrom famous Edmund Langley Duke of York
p2774
aVMarrying my sister that thy mother was
p2775
aVAgain in pity of my hard distress
p2776
aVLevied an army weening to redeem
p2777
aVAnd have installed me in the diadem
p2778
aVBut as the rest so fell that noble earl
p2779
aVAnd was beheaded Thus the Mortimers
p2780
aVIn whom the title rested were suppressed
p2781
aVOf which my lord your Honor is the last
p2782
aVTrue and thou seest that I no issue have
p2783
aVAnd that my fainting words do warrant death
p2784
aVThou art my heir the rest I wish thee gather
p2785
aVBut yet be wary in thy studious care
p2786
aVThy grave admonishments prevail with me
p2787
aVBut yet methinks my father\u2019s execution
p2788
aVWas nothing less than bloody tyranny
p2789
aVWith silence nephew be thou politic
p2790
aVStrong-fixèd is the house of Lancaster
p2791
aVAnd like a mountain not to be removed
p2792
aVBut now thy uncle is removing hence
p2793
aVAs princes do their courts when they are cloyed
p2794
aVWith long continuance in a settled place
p2795
aVO uncle would some part of my young years
p2796
aVMight but redeem the passage of your age
p2797
aVThou dost then wrong me as that slaughterer doth
p2798
aVWhich giveth many wounds when one will kill
p2799
aVMourn not except thou sorrow for my good
p2800
aVOnly give order for my funeral
p2801
aVAnd so farewell and fair be all thy hopes
p2802
aVAnd prosperous be thy life in peace and war
p2803
aVAnd peace no war befall thy parting soul
p2804
aVIn prison hast thou spent a pilgrimage
p2805
aVAnd like a hermit overpassed thy days
p2806
aVWell I will lock his counsel in my breast
p2807
aVAnd what I do imagine let that rest
p2808
aVKeepers convey him hence and I myself
p2809
aVWill see his burial better than his life
p2810
aVHere dies the dusky torch of Mortimer
p2811
aVChoked with ambition of the meaner sort
p2812
aVAnd for those wrongs those bitter injuries
p2813
aVWhich Somerset hath offered to my house
p2814
aVI doubt not but with honor to redress
p2815
aVAnd therefore haste I to the Parliament
p2816
aVEither to be restorèd to my blood
p2817
aVOr make mine ill th\u2019 advantage of my good
p2818
aVCom\u2019st thou with deep premeditated lines
p2819
aVWith written pamphlets studiously devised
p2820
aVHumphrey of Gloucester if thou canst accuse
p2821
aVOr aught intend\u2019st to lay unto my charge
p2822
aVDo it without invention suddenly
p2823
aVAs I with sudden and extemporal speech
p2824
aVPurpose to answer what thou canst object
p2825
aVPresumptuous priest this place commands my patience
p2826
aVOr thou shouldst find thou hast dishonored me
p2827
aVThink not although in writing I preferred
p2828
aVThe manner of thy vile outrageous crimes
p2829
aVThat therefore I have forged or am not able
p2830
aVVerbatim to rehearse the method of my pen
p2831
aVNo prelate such is thy audacious wickedness
p2832
aVThy lewd pestiferous and dissentious pranks
p2833
aVAs very infants prattle of thy pride
p2834
aVThou art a most pernicious usurer
p2835
aVFroward by nature enemy to peace
p2836
aVLascivious wanton more than well beseems
p2837
aVA man of thy profession and degree
p2838
aVAnd for thy treachery what\u2019s more manifest
p2839
aVIn that thou laid\u2019st a trap to take my life
p2840
aVAs well at London Bridge as at the Tower
p2841
aVBesides I fear me if thy thoughts were sifted
p2842
aVThe King thy sovereign is not quite exempt
p2843
aVFrom envious malice of thy swelling heart
p2844
aVGloucester I do defy thee Lords vouchsafe
p2845
aVTo give me hearing what I shall reply
p2846
aVIf I were covetous ambitious or perverse
p2847
aVAs he will have me how am I so poor
p2848
aVOr how haps it I seek not to advance
p2849
aVOr raise myself but keep my wonted calling
p2850
aVAnd for dissension who preferreth peace
p2851
aVMore than I do except I be provoked
p2852
aVNo my good lords it is not that offends
p2853
aVIt is not that that hath incensed the Duke
p2854
aVIt is because no one should sway but he
p2855
aVNo one but he should be about the King
p2856
aVAnd that engenders thunder in his breast
p2857
aVAnd makes him roar these accusations forth
p2858
aVBut he shall know I am as good
p2859
aVAs good
p2860
aVThou bastard of my grandfather
p2861
aVAy lordly sir for what are you I pray
p2862
aVBut one imperious in another\u2019s throne
p2863
aVAm I not Protector saucy priest
p2864
aVAnd am not I a prelate of the Church
p2865
aVYes as an outlaw in a castle keeps
p2866
aVAnd useth it to patronage his theft
p2867
aVUnreverent Gloucester
p2868
aVThou art reverend
p2869
aVTouching thy spiritual function not thy life
p2870
aVRome shall remedy this
p2871
aVRoam thither then
p2872
aVMy lord it were your duty to forbear
p2873
aVAy so the Bishop be not overborne
p2874
aVMethinks my lord should be religious
p2875
aVAnd know the office that belongs to such
p2876
aVMethinks his Lordship should be humbler
p2877
aVIt fitteth not a prelate so to plead
p2878
aVYes when his holy state is touched so near
p2879
aVState holy or unhallowed what of that
p2880
aVIs not his Grace Protector to the King
p2881
aVPlantagenet I see must hold his tongue
p2882
aVLest it be said Speak sirrah when you should

aVMust your bold verdict enter talk with lords
p2884
aVElse would I have a fling at Winchester
p2885
aVUncles of Gloucester and of Winchester
p2886
aVThe special watchmen of our English weal
p2887
aVI would prevail if prayers might prevail
p2888
aVTo join your hearts in love and amity

aVO what a scandal is it to our crown
p2890
aVThat two such noble peers as you should jar
p2891
aVBelieve me lords my tender years can tell

aVCivil dissension is a viperous worm
p2893
aVThat gnaws the bowels of the commonwealth
p2894
aVWhat tumult \u2019s this
p2895
aVAn uproar I dare warrant
p2896
aVBegun through malice of the Bishop\u2019s men
p2897
aVO my good lords and virtuous Henry

aVPity the city of London pity us
p2899
aVThe Bishop and the Duke of Gloucester\u2019s men
p2900
aVForbidden late to carry any weapon
p2901
aVHave filled their pockets full of pebble stones
p2902
aVAnd banding themselves in contrary parts
p2903
aVDo pelt so fast at one another\u2019s pate
p2904
aVThat many have their giddy brains knocked out
p2905
aVOur windows are broke down in every street

aVAnd we for fear compelled to shut our shops

aVPray Uncle Gloucester mitigate this strife
p2910
aVDo what you dare we are as resolute

aVMy lord we know your Grace to be a man
p2914
aVJust and upright and for your royal birth

aVMy sighs and tears and will not once relent
p2929
aVWho should be pitiful if you be not

aVTo slay your sovereign and destroy the realm

aVThen be at peace except you thirst for blood

p2942
aVBehold my Lord of Winchester the Duke
p2943
aVHath banished moody discontented fury
p2944
aVAs by his smoothèd brows it doth appear
p2945
aVWhy look you still so stern and tragical
p2946
aVHere Winchester I offer thee my hand
p2947
aVFie Uncle Beaufort I have heard you preach
p2948
aVThat malice was a great and grievous sin
p2949
aVAnd will not you maintain the thing you teach
p2950
aVBut prove a chief offender in the same
p2951
aVSweet king The Bishop hath a kindly gird
p2952
aVFor shame my Lord of Winchester relent

aVBut join in friendship as your lords have done
p2966
aVContent I\u2019ll to the surgeon\u2019s
p2967
aVAnd so will I
p2968
aVAccept this scroll most gracious sovereign
p2969
aVWhich in the right of Richard Plantagenet
p2970
aVWe do exhibit to your Majesty
p2971
aVWell urged my Lord of Warwick For sweet prince
p2972
aVAn if your Grace mark every circumstance
p2973
aVYou have great reason to do Richard right
p2974
aVEspecially for those occasions
p2975
aVAt Eltham Place I told your Majesty
p2976
aVAnd those occasions uncle were of force
p2977
aVTherefore my loving lords our pleasure is
p2978
aVThat Richard be restorèd to his blood
p2979
aVLet Richard be restorèd to his blood
p2980
aVSo shall his father\u2019s wrongs be recompensed
p2981
aVAs will the rest so willeth Winchester
p2982
aVIf Richard will be true not that alone
p2983
aVBut all the whole inheritance I give
p2984
aVThat doth belong unto the house of York
p2985
aVFrom whence you spring by lineal descent
p2986
aVThy humble servant vows obedience
p2987
aVAnd humble service till the point of death
p2988
aVStoop then and set your knee against my foot
p2989
aVAnd in reguerdon of that duty done
p2990
aVI girt thee with the valiant sword of York
p2991
aVRise Richard like a true Plantagenet
p2992
aVAnd rise created princely Duke of York
p2993
aVAnd so thrive Richard as thy foes may fall
p2994
aVAnd as my duty springs so perish they

aVThat grudge one thought against your Majesty
p2996
aVWelcome high prince the mighty Duke of York
p2997
aVPerish base prince ignoble Duke of York
p2998
aVNow will it best avail your Majesty
p2999
aVTo cross the seas and to be crowned in France
p3000
aVThe presence of a king engenders love
p3001
aVAmongst his subjects and his loyal friends
p3002
aVAs it disanimates his enemies
p3003
aVWhen Gloucester says the word King Henry goes
p3004
aVFor friendly counsel cuts off many foes
p3005
aVYour ships already are in readiness
p3006
aVAy we may march in England or in France
p3007
aVNot seeing what is likely to ensue
p3008
aVThis late dissension grown betwixt the peers
p3009
aVBurns under feignèd ashes of forged love
p3010
aVAnd will at last break out into a flame
p3011
aVAs festered members rot but by degree
p3012
aVTill bones and flesh and sinews fall away
p3013
aVSo will this base and envious discord breed
p3014
aVAnd now I fear that fatal prophecy
p3015
aVWhich in the time of Henry named the Fifth
p3016
aVWas in the mouth of every sucking babe
p3017
aVThat Henry born at Monmouth should win all
p3018
aVAnd Henry born at Windsor should lose all
p3019
aVWhich is so plain that Exeter doth wish
p3020
aVHis days may finish ere that hapless time
p3021
aVThese are the city gates the gates of Roan
p3022
aVThrough which our policy must make a breach
p3023
aVTake heed Be wary how you place your words
p3024
aVTalk like the vulgar sort of market men
p3025
aVThat come to gather money for their corn
p3026
aVIf we have entrance as I hope we shall
p3027
aVAnd that we find the slothful watch but weak
p3028
aVI\u2019ll by a sign give notice to our friends
p3029
aVThat Charles the Dauphin may encounter them
p3030
aVOur sacks shall be a mean to sack the city
p3031
aVAnd we be lords and rulers over Roan
p3032
aVTherefore we\u2019ll knock
p3033
aVQui là

aVPaysans la pauvre gens de France
p3035
aVPoor market folks that come to sell their corn
p3036
aVEnter go in The market bell is rung
p3037
aVNow Roan I\u2019ll shake thy bulwarks to the ground
p3038
aVSaint Dennis bless this happy stratagem
p3039
aVAnd once again we\u2019ll sleep secure in Roan
p3040
aVHere entered Pucelle and her practisants
p3041
aVNow she is there how will she specify
p3042
aVHere is the best and safest passage in
p3043
aVBy thrusting out a torch from yonder tower
p3044
aVWhich once discerned shows that her meaning is
p3045
aVNo way to that for weakness which she entered
p3046
aVBehold this is the happy wedding torch
p3047
aVThat joineth Roan unto her countrymen
p3048
aVBut burning fatal to the Talbonites
p3049
aVSee noble Charles the beacon of our friend
p3050
aVThe burning torch in yonder turret stands
p3051
aVNow shine it like a comet of revenge
p3052
aVA prophet to the fall of all our foes
p3053
aVDefer no time delays have dangerous ends
p3054
aVEnter and cry The Dauphin presently
p3055
aVAnd then do execution on the watch
p3056
aVFrance thou shalt rue this treason with thy tears
p3057
aVIf Talbot but survive thy treachery
p3058
aVPucelle that witch that damnèd sorceress
p3059
aVHath wrought this hellish mischief unawares
p3060
aVThat hardly we escaped the pride of France
p3061
aVGood morrow gallants Want you corn for bread
p3062
aVI think the Duke of Burgundy will fast
p3063
aVBefore he\u2019ll buy again at such a rate
p3064
aV\u2019Twas full of darnel Do you like the taste
p3065
aVScoff on vile fiend and shameless courtesan
p3066
aVI trust ere long to choke thee with thine own
p3067
aVAnd make thee curse the harvest of that corn
p3068
aVYour Grace may starve perhaps before that time
p3069
aVO let no words but deeds revenge this treason
p3070
aVWhat will you do good graybeard Break a lance
p3071
aVAnd run a-tilt at Death within a chair
p3072
aVFoul fiend of France and hag of all despite
p3073
aVEncompassed with thy lustful paramours
p3074
aVBecomes it thee to taunt his valiant age
p3075
aVAnd twit with cowardice a man half dead
p3076
aVDamsel I\u2019ll have a bout with you again
p3077
aVOr else let Talbot perish with this shame
p3078
aVAre you so hot sir Yet Pucelle hold thy peace

aVGod speed the Parliament Who shall be the Speaker

p3082
aVBelike your Lordship takes us then for fools
p3083
aVTo try if that our own be ours or no

aVSeigneur no

p3090
aVAnd dare not take up arms like gentlemen
p3091
aVAway captains Let\u2019s get us from the walls
p3092
aVFor Talbot means no goodness by his looks
p3093
aVGoodbye my lord We came but to tell you

p3112
aVAnd will be partner of your weal or woe
p3113
aVCourageous Bedford let us now persuade you
p3114
aVNot to be gone from hence for once I read
p3115
aVThat stout Pendragon in his litter sick
p3116
aVCame to the field and vanquishèd his foes
p3117
aVMethinks I should revive the soldiers\u2019 hearts
p3118
aVBecause I ever found them as myself
p3119
aVUndaunted spirit in a dying breast
p3120
aVThen be it so Heavens keep old Bedford safe
p3121
aVAnd now no more ado brave Burgundy

aVCowardly knight ill fortune follow thee

aVThey that of late were daring with their scoffs
p3135
aVAre glad and fain by flight to save themselves
p3136
aVLost and recovered in a day again
p3137
aVThis is a double honor Burgundy

aVYet heavens have glory for this victory
p3139
aVWarlike and martial Talbot Burgundy
p3140
aVEnshrines thee in his heart and there erects
p3141
aVThy noble deeds as valor\u2019s monuments
p3142
aVThanks gentle duke But where is Pucelle now
p3143
aVI think her old familiar is asleep
p3144
aVNow where\u2019s the Bastard\u2019s braves and Charles his gleeks
p3145
aVWhat all amort Roan hangs her head for grief
p3146
aVThat such a valiant company are fled
p3147
aVNow will we take some order in the town
p3148
aVPlacing therein some expert officers
p3149
aVAnd then depart to Paris to the King
p3150
aVFor there young Henry with his nobles lie
p3151
aVWhat wills Lord Talbot pleaseth Burgundy
p3152
aVBut yet before we go let\u2019s not forget
p3153
aVThe noble Duke of Bedford late-deceased
p3154
aVBut see his exequies fulfilled in Roan
p3155
aVA braver soldier never couchèd lance
p3156
aVA gentler heart did never sway in court
p3157
aVBut kings and mightiest potentates must die
p3158
aVFor that\u2019s the end of human misery
p3159
aVDismay not princes at this accident
p3160
aVNor grieve that Roan is so recoverèd
p3161
aVCare is no cure but rather corrosive
p3162
aVFor things that are not to be remedied
p3163
aVLet frantic Talbot triumph for a while
p3164
aVAnd like a peacock sweep along his tail
p3165
aVWe\u2019ll pull his plumes and take away his train
p3166
aVIf dauphin and the rest will be but ruled
p3167
aVWe have been guided by thee hitherto
p3168
aVAnd of thy cunning had no diffidence
p3169
aVOne sudden foil shall never breed distrust
p3170
aVSearch out thy wit for secret policies
p3171
aVAnd we will make thee famous through the world

aVWe will entice the Duke of Burgundy
p3178
aVTo leave the Talbot and to follow us
p3179
aVAy marry sweeting if we could do that
p3180
aVFrance were no place for Henry\u2019s warriors
p3181
aVNor should that nation boast it so with us
p3182
aVBut be extirpèd from our provinces
p3183
aVForever should they be expulsed from France
p3184
aVAnd not have title of an earldom here
p3185
aVYour honors shall perceive how I will work
p3186
aVTo bring this matter to the wishèd end

aVTheir powers are marching unto Paris-ward
p3189
aVThere goes the Talbot with his colors spread
p3190
aVAnd all the troops of English after him
p3191
aVNow in the rearward comes the Duke and his
p3192
aVFortune in favor makes him lag behind
p3193
aVSummon a parley we will talk with him

aVSee see the pining malady of France
p3208

p3211
aVStrike those that hurt and hurt not those that help
p3212
aVOne drop of blood drawn from thy country\u2019s bosom

aVShould grieve thee more than streams of foreign gore

aVWho join\u2019st thou with but with a lordly nation
p3221
aVThat will not trust thee but for profit\u2019s sake
p3222
aVWhen Talbot hath set footing once in France
p3223
aVAnd fashioned thee that instrument of ill
p3224
aVWho then but English Henry will be lord
p3225
aVAnd thou be thrust out like a fugitive
p3226
aVCall we to mind and mark but this for proof
p3227
aVWas not the Duke of Orleance thy foe
p3228
aVAnd was he not in England prisoner
p3229
aVBut when they heard he was thine enemy
p3230
aVThey set him free without his ransom paid
p3231
aVIn spite of Burgundy and all his friends
p3232
aVSee then thou fight\u2019st against thy countrymen

aVWhich I have done because unworthily
p3311
aVThou wast installèd in that high degree
p3312
aVPardon me princely Henry and the rest
p3313
aVThis dastard at the battle of Patay
p3314
aVWhen but in all I was six thousand strong
p3315
aVAnd that the French were almost ten to one
p3316
aVBefore we met or that a stroke was given
p3317
aVLike to a trusty squire did run away
p3318
aVIn which assault we lost twelve hundred men
p3319
aVMyself and divers gentlemen besides

aVTo say the truth this fact was infamous

aVWhen first this Order was ordained my lords
p3328
aVKnights of the Garter were of noble birth

aVWith other vile and ignominious terms

aVAnd then your Highness shall command a peace
p3413
aVThe quarrel toucheth none but us alone
p3414
aVBetwixt ourselves let us decide it then
p3415
aVThere is my pledge accept it Somerset
p3416
aVNay let it rest where it began at first
p3417
aVConfirm it so mine honorable lord
p3418
aVConfirm it so Confounded be your strife
p3419
aVAnd perish you with your audacious prate
p3420
aVPresumptuous vassals are you not ashamed
p3421
aVWith this immodest clamorous outrage
p3422
aVTo trouble and disturb the King and us
p3423
aVAnd you my lords methinks you do not well
p3424

aVQuite to forget this quarrel and the cause
p3432
aVAnd you my lords remember where we are
p3433
aVIn France amongst a fickle wavering nation
p3434
aVIf they perceive dissension in our looks
p3435
aVAnd that within ourselves we disagree
p3436
aVHow will their grudging stomachs be provoked
p3437
aVTo willful disobedience and rebel
p3438
aVBesides what infamy will there arise
p3439
aVWhen foreign princes shall be certified
p3440
aVThat for a toy a thing of no regard
p3441
aVKing Henry\u2019s peers and chief nobility
p3442
aVDestroyed themselves and lost the realm of France
p3443
aVO think upon the conquest of my father
p3444
aVMy tender years and let us not forgo
p3445
aVThat for a trifle that was bought with blood
p3446
aVLet me be umpire in this doubtful strife
p3447
aVI see no reason if I wear this rose
p3448
aVThat anyone should therefore be suspicious
p3449
aVI more incline to Somerset than York
p3450
aVBoth are my kinsmen and I love them both
p3451
aVAs well they may upbraid me with my crown
p3452
aVBecause forsooth the King of Scots is crowned
p3453
aVBut your discretions better can persuade
p3454
aVThan I am able to instruct or teach
p3455
aVAnd therefore as we hither came in peace
p3456
aVSo let us still continue peace and love
p3457
aVCousin of York we institute your Grace

aVTo be our regent in these parts of France

aVFrom thence to England where I hope ere long
p3467
aVTo be presented by your victories
p3468
aVWith Charles Alanson and that traitorous rout
p3469
aVMy Lord of York I promise you the King
p3470
aVPrettily methought did play the orator
p3471
aVAnd so he did but yet I like it not
p3472
aVIn that he wears the badge of Somerset
p3473
aVTush that was but his fancy blame him not
p3474
aVI dare presume sweet prince he thought no harm
p3475
aVAnd if iwis he did but let it rest
p3476
aVOther affairs must now be managèd
p3477
aVWell didst thou Richard to suppress thy voice
p3478
aVFor had the passions of thy heart burst out
p3479
aVI fear we should have seen deciphered there
p3480
aVMore rancorous spite more furious raging broils
p3481
aVThan yet can be imagined or supposed
p3482
aVBut howsoe\u2019er no simple man that sees
p3483
aVThis jarring discord of nobility
p3484
aVThis shouldering of each other in the court
p3485
aVThis factious bandying of their favorites
p3486
aVBut sees it doth presage some ill event
p3487
aV\u2019Tis much when scepters are in children\u2019s hands
p3488
aVBut more when envy breeds unkind division
p3489
aVThere comes the ruin there begins confusion

aVSummon their general unto the wall
p3492
aVEnglish John Talbot captains calls you forth

aVBe humble to us call my sovereign yours
p3496
aVAnd do him homage as obedient subjects
p3497
aVAnd I\u2019ll withdraw me and my bloody power

aVYou tempt the fury of my three attendants

p3506
aVThe period of thy tyranny approacheth
p3507
aVOn us thou canst not enter but by death

aVFor I protest we are well fortified

aVOn either hand thee there are squadrons pitched

p3741
aVThe sword of Orleance hath not made me smart
p3742
aVThese words of yours draw lifeblood from my heart
p3743
aVOn that advantage bought with such a shame
p3744
aVTo save a paltry life and slay bright fame
p3745
aVBefore young Talbot from old Talbot fly
p3746
aVThe coward horse that bears me fall and die
p3747
aVAnd like me to the peasant boys of France
p3748
aVTo be shame\u2019s scorn and subject of mischance
p3749
aVSurely by all the glory you have won
p3750
aVAn if I fly I am not Talbot\u2019s son
p3751
aVThen talk no more of flight it is no boot
p3752
aVIf son to Talbot die at Talbot\u2019s foot
p3753
aVThen follow thou thy desp\u2019rate sire of Crete
p3754
aVThou Icarus thy life to me is sweet
p3755
aVIf thou wilt fight fight by thy father\u2019s side
p3756
aVAnd commendable proved let\u2019s die in pride
p3757
aVWhere is my other life Mine own is gone
p3758
aVO where\u2019s young Talbot Where is valiant John
p3759
aVTriumphant Death smeared with captivity
p3760
aVYoung Talbot\u2019s valor makes me smile at thee
p3761
aVWhen he perceived me shrink and on my knee
p3762
aVHis bloody sword he brandished over me
p3763
aVAnd like a hungry lion did commence
p3764
aVRough deeds of rage and stern impatience
p3765
aVBut when my angry guardant stood alone
p3766
aVTend\u2019ring my ruin and assailed of none
p3767
aVDizzy-eyed fury and great rage of heart
p3768
aVSuddenly made him from my side to start
p3769
aVInto the clust\u2019ring battle of the French
p3770
aVAnd in that sea of blood my boy did drench
p3771
aVHis over-mounting spirit and there died
p3772
aVMy Icarus my blossom in his pride
p3773
aVO my dear lord lo where your son is borne
p3774
aVThou antic Death which laugh\u2019st us here to scorn
p3775
aVAnon from thy insulting tyranny
p3776
aVCoupled in bonds of perpetuity
p3777
aVTwo Talbots wingèd through the lither sky
p3778
aVIn thy despite shall scape mortality
p3779
aVO thou whose wounds become hard-favored Death
p3780
aVSpeak to thy father ere thou yield thy breath
p3781
aVBrave Death by speaking whither he will or no
p3782
aVImagine him a Frenchman and thy foe
p3783
aVPoor boy he smiles methinks as who should say
p3784
aVHad Death been French then Death had died today
p3785
aVCome come and lay him in his father\u2019s arms
p3786
aVMy spirit can no longer bear these harms
p3787
aVSoldiers adieu I have what I would have
p3788
aVNow my old arms are young John Talbot\u2019s grave
p3789
aVHad York and Somerset brought rescue in
p3790
aVWe should have found a bloody day of this
p3791
aVHow the young whelp of Talbot\u2019s raging wood
p3792
aVDid flesh his puny sword in Frenchmen\u2019s blood
p3793
aVOnce I encountered him and thus I said
p3794
aVThou maiden youth be vanquished by a maid
p3795
aVBut with a proud majestical high scorn
p3796
aVHe answered thus Young Talbot was not born
p3797
aVTo be the pillage of a giglot wench
p3798
aVSo rushing in the bowels of the French
p3799
aVHe left me proudly as unworthy fight
p3800
aVDoubtless he would have made a noble knight
p3801
aVSee where he lies inhearsèd in the arms
p3802
aVOf the most bloody nurser of his harms
p3803
aVHew them to pieces hack their bones asunder
p3804
aVWhose life was England\u2019s glory Gallia\u2019s wonder

aVHerald conduct me to the Dauphin\u2019s tent

aVTo know who hath obtained the glory of the day
p3809
aVOn what submissive message art thou sent
p3810
aVSubmission dauphin \u2019Tis a mere French word
p3811
aVWe English warriors wot not what it means

aVIs Talbot slain the Frenchmen\u2019s only scourge
p3834
aVYour kingdom\u2019s terror and black Nemesis

aVO were mine eyeballs into bullets turned
p3836
aVThat I in rage might shoot them at your faces

aVO that I could but call these dead to life
p3838
aVIt were enough to fright the realm of France
p3839
aVWere but his picture left amongst you here

aVIt would amaze the proudest of you all
p3841
aVGive me their bodies that I may bear them hence
p3842
aVAnd give them burial as beseems their worth
p3843
aVI think this upstart is old Talbot\u2019s ghost
p3844
aVHe speaks with such a proud commanding spirit
p3845
aVFor God\u2019s sake let him have him To keep them here
p3846
aVThey would but stink and putrefy the air
p3847
aVGo take their bodies hence
p3848

aVThey humbly sue unto your Excellence
p3858
aVTo have a godly peace concluded of

aVBetween the realms of England and of France
p3860
aVHow doth your Grace affect their motion

aVWell my good lord and as the only means
p3862
aVTo stop effusion of our Christian blood
p3863
aVAnd stablish quietness on every side
p3864
aVAy marry uncle for I always thought
p3865
aVIt was both impious and unnatural
p3866
aVThat such immanity and bloody strife

aVShould reign among professors of one faith
p3868
aVBesides my lord the sooner to effect

aVIn marriage with a large and sumptuous dowry
p3874
aVMarriage uncle Alas my years are young

aVAnd fitter is my study and my books

aVYet call th\u2019 Ambassadors and as you please
p3878
aVSo let them have their answers every one
p3879
aVI shall be well content with any choice
p3880
aVTends to God\u2019s glory and my country\u2019s weal
p3881
aVWhat is my Lord of Winchester installed
p3882
aVAnd called unto a cardinal\u2019s degree
p3883
aVThen I perceive that will be verified
p3884
aVHenry the Fifth did sometime prophesy
p3885
aVIf once he come to be a cardinal
p3886
aVHe\u2019ll make his cap coequal with the crown
p3887
aVMy Lords Ambassadors your several suits
p3888
aVHave been considered and debated on
p3889
aVYour purpose is both good and reasonable
p3890
aVAnd therefore are we certainly resolved
p3891
aVTo draw conditions of a friendly peace
p3892
aVWhich by my Lord of Winchester we mean
p3893
aVShall be transported presently to France
p3894
aVAnd for the proffer of my lord your master

aVAs liking of the lady\u2019s virtuous gifts
p3897
aVHer beauty and the value of her dower

aVIn argument and proof of which contract

aVBear her this jewel pledge of my affection

aVAnd so my Lord Protector see them guarded

aVStay my Lord Legate you shall first receive

aVThe sum of money which I promisèd
p3906
aVShould be delivered to his Holiness
p3907
aVFor clothing me in these grave ornaments
p3908
aVI will attend upon your Lordship\u2019s leisure
p3909
aVNow Winchester will not submit I trow
p3910
aVOr be inferior to the proudest peer
p3911
aVHumphrey of Gloucester thou shalt well perceive
p3912
aVThat neither in birth or for authority
p3913
aVThe Bishop will be overborne by thee
p3914
aVI\u2019ll either make thee stoop and bend thy knee
p3915
aVOr sack this country with a mutiny

aVOf all base passions fear is most accursed
p3934
aVCommand the conquest Charles it shall be thine
p3935
aVLet Henry fret and all the world repine
p3936
aVThen on my lords and France be fortunate

aVPay recompense if you will grant my suit
p3956
aVCannot my body nor blood-sacrifice
p3957
aVEntreat you to your wonted furtherance
p3958
aVThen take my soul my body soul and all
p3959
aVBefore that England give the French the foil
p3960
aVSee they forsake me Now the time is come
p3961
aVThat France must vail her lofty-plumèd crest
p3962
aVAnd let her head fall into England\u2019s lap
p3963
aVMy ancient incantations are too weak

p3992
aVSo doth the swan her downy cygnets save

aVMy hand would free her but my heart says no

p4000
aVSo seems this gorgeous beauty to mine eyes
p4001
aVFain would I woo her yet I dare not speak
p4002
aVI\u2019ll call for pen and ink and write my mind

aVFie de la Pole disable not thyself

aVConfounds the tongue and makes the senses rough
p4008
aVSay Earl of Suffolk if thy name be so

aVWhat ransom must I pay before I pass

aVFor I perceive I am thy prisoner
p4011
aVHow canst thou tell she will deny thy suit

aVFond man remember that thou hast a wife

aVI were best to leave him for he will not hear
p4020
aVThere all is marred there lies a cooling card
p4021
aVHe talks at random sure the man is mad

aVHe talks of wood It is some carpenter
p4027
aVYet so my fancy may be satisfied
p4028
aVAnd peace establishèd between these realms
p4029
aVBut there remains a scruple in that too
p4030
aVFor though her father be the King of Naples
p4031
aVDuke of Anjou and Maine yet is he poor
p4032
aVAnd our nobility will scorn the match
p4033
aVHear you captain Are you not at leisure

aVYour bondage happy to be made a queen
p4048
aVTo be a queen in bondage is more vile
p4049
aVThan is a slave in base servility
p4050
aVFor princes should be free
p4051
aVAnd so shall you
p4052
aVIf happy England\u2019s royal king be free

aVOut out My lords an please you \u2019tis not so
p4147
aVI did beget her all the parish knows
p4148
aVHer mother liveth yet can testify
p4149
aVShe was the first fruit of my bach\u2019lorship
p4150
aVGraceless wilt thou deny thy parentage
p4151
aVThis argues what her kind of life hath been
p4152
aVWicked and vile and so her death concludes
p4153
aVFie Joan that thou wilt be so obstacle
p4154
aVGod knows thou art a collop of my flesh
p4155
aVAnd for thy sake have I shed many a tear
p4156
aVDeny me not I prithee gentle Joan
p4157
aVPeasant avaunt You have suborned this man
p4158
aVOf purpose to obscure my noble birth
p4159
aV\u2019Tis true I gave a noble to the priest
p4160
aVThe morn that I was wedded to her mother
p4161
aVKneel down and take my blessing good my girl
p4162
aVWilt thou not stoop Now cursèd be the time
p4163
aVOf thy nativity I would the milk
p4164
aVThy mother gave thee when thou suck\u2019dst her breast
p4165
aVHad been a little ratsbane for thy sake
p4166
aVOr else when thou didst keep my lambs afield
p4167
aVI wish some ravenous wolf had eaten thee
p4168
aVDost thou deny thy father cursèd drab
p4169
aVO burn her burn her Hanging is too good
p4170
aVTake her away for she hath lived too long
p4171
aVTo fill the world with vicious qualities
p4172
aVFirst let me tell you whom you have condemned
p4173
aVNot one begotten of a shepherd swain
p4174
aVBut issued from the progeny of kings
p4175
aVVirtuous and holy chosen from above
p4176
aVBy inspiration of celestial grace
p4177
aVTo work exceeding miracles on earth
p4178
aVI never had to do with wicked spirits
p4179
aVBut you that are polluted with your lusts
p4180
aVStained with the guiltless blood of innocents
p4181
aVCorrupt and tainted with a thousand vices
p4182
aVBecause you want the grace that others have
p4183
aVYou judge it straight a thing impossible
p4184
aVTo compass wonders but by help of devils
p4185
aVNo misconceivèd Joan of Arc hath been
p4186
aVA virgin from her tender infancy
p4187
aVChaste and immaculate in very thought
p4188
aVWhose maiden blood thus rigorously effused
p4189
aVWill cry for vengeance at the gates of heaven
p4190
aVAy ay Away with her to execution
p4191
aVAnd hark you sirs because she is a maid
p4192
aVSpare for no faggots let there be enow
p4193
aVPlace barrels of pitch upon the fatal stake
p4194
aVThat so her torture may be shortenèd
p4195
aVWill nothing turn your unrelenting hearts
p4196
aVThen Joan discover thine infirmity
p4197
aVThat warranteth by law to be thy privilege
p4198
aVI am with child you bloody homicides
p4199
aVMurder not then the fruit within my womb
p4200
aVAlthough you hale me to a violent death
p4201
aVNow heaven forfend the holy maid with child
p4202
aVThe greatest miracle that e\u2019er you wrought
p4203
aVIs all your strict preciseness come to this
p4204
aVShe and the Dauphin have been juggling
p4205
aVI did imagine what would be her refuge
p4206
aVWell go to we\u2019ll have no bastards live
p4207
aVEspecially since Charles must father it
p4208
aVYou are deceived my child is none of his
p4209
aVIt was Alanson that enjoyed my love
p4210
aVAlanson that notorious Machiavel
p4211
aVIt dies an if it had a thousand lives
p4212
aVO give me leave I have deluded you
p4213
aV\u2019Twas neither Charles nor yet the Duke I named
p4214
aVBut Reignier King of Naples that prevailed
p4215
aVA married man That\u2019s most intolerable
p4216
aVWhy here\u2019s a girl I think she knows not well
p4217
aVThere were so many whom she may accuse
p4218
aVIt\u2019s sign she hath been liberal and free
p4219
aVAnd yet forsooth she is a virgin pure
p4220
aVStrumpet thy words condemn thy brat and thee
p4221
aVUse no entreaty for it is in vain
p4222
aVThen lead me hence with whom I leave my curse
p4223
aVMay never glorious sun reflex his beams
p4224
aVUpon the country where you make abode
p4225
aVBut darkness and the gloomy shade of death
p4226
aVEnviron you till mischief and despair
p4227
aVDrive you to break your necks or hang yourselves
p4228
aVBreak thou in pieces and consume to ashes
p4229
aVThou foul accursèd minister of hell
p4230
aVLord Regent I do greet your Excellence
p4231
aVWith letters of commission from the King
p4232
aVFor know my lords the states of Christendom
p4233
aVMoved with remorse of these outrageous broils
p4234
aVHave earnestly implored a general peace
p4235
aVBetwixt our nation and the aspiring French
p4236
aVAnd here at hand the Dauphin and his train
p4237
aVApproacheth to confer about some matter
p4238
aVIs all our travail turned to this effect
p4239
aVAfter the slaughter of so many peers
p4240
aVSo many captains gentlemen and soldiers
p4241
aVThat in this quarrel have been overthrown
p4242
aVAnd sold their bodies for their country\u2019s benefit
p4243
aVShall we at last conclude effeminate peace
p4244
aVHave we not lost most part of all the towns
p4245
aVBy treason falsehood and by treachery
p4246
aVOur great progenitors had conquerèd
p4247
aVO Warwick Warwick I foresee with grief
p4248
aVThe utter loss of all the realm of France
p4249
aVBe patient York if we conclude a peace
p4250
aVIt shall be with such strict and severe covenants
p4251
aVAs little shall the Frenchmen gain thereby
p4252
aVSince lords of England it is thus agreed
p4253
aVThat peaceful truce shall be proclaimed in France
p4254
aVWe come to be informèd by yourselves
p4255
aVWhat the conditions of that league must be
p4256
aVSpeak Winchester for boiling choler chokes
p4257
aVThe hollow passage of my poisoned voice
p4258
aVBy sight of these our baleful enemies
p4259
aVCharles and the rest it is enacted thus
p4260
aVThat in regard King Henry gives consent
p4261
aVOf mere compassion and of lenity
p4262
aVTo ease your country of distressful war
p4263
aVAnd suffer you to breathe in fruitful peace
p4264
aVYou shall become true liegemen to his crown
p4265
aVAnd Charles upon condition thou wilt swear
p4266
aVTo pay him tribute and submit thyself
p4267
aVThou shalt be placed as viceroy under him
p4268
aVAnd still enjoy thy regal dignity
p4269
aVMust he be then as shadow of himself
p4270
aVAdorn his temples with a coronet
p4271
aVAnd yet in substance and authority
p4272
aVRetain but privilege of a private man
p4273
aVThis proffer is absurd and reasonless
p4274
aV\u2019Tis known already that I am possessed
p4275
aVWith more than half the Gallian territories
p4276
aVAnd therein reverenced for their lawful king
p4277
aVShall I for lucre of the rest unvanquished
p4278
aVDetract so much from that prerogative
p4279
aVAs to be called but viceroy of the whole
p4280
aVNo lord ambassador I\u2019ll rather keep
p4281
aVThat which I have than coveting for more
p4282
aVBe cast from possibility of all
p4283
aVInsulting Charles hast thou by secret means
p4284
aVUsed intercession to obtain a league
p4285
aVAnd now the matter grows to compromise
p4286
aVStand\u2019st thou aloof upon comparison
p4287
aVEither accept the title thou usurp\u2019st
p4288
aVOf benefit proceeding from our king
p4289
aVAnd not of any challenge of desert
p4290
aVOr we will plague thee with incessant wars
p4291
aVMy lord you do not well in obstinacy
p4292
aVTo cavil in the course of this contract
p4293
aVIf once it be neglected ten to one
p4294
aVWe shall not find like opportunity
p4295
aVTo say the truth it is your policy
p4296
aVTo save your subjects from such massacre
p4297
aVAnd ruthless slaughters as are daily seen
p4298
aVBy our proceeding in hostility
p4299
aVAnd therefore take this compact of a truce
p4300
aVAlthough you break it when your pleasure serves
p4301
aVHow say\u2019st thou Charles Shall our condition stand
p4302
aVIt shall only reserved you claim no interest
p4303
aVIn any of our towns of garrison
p4304
aVThen swear allegiance to his Majesty
p4305
aVAs thou art knight never to disobey
p4306
aVNor be rebellious to the crown of England
p4307
aVThou nor thy nobles to the crown of England
p4308
aVSo now dismiss your army when you please
p4309
aVHang up your ensigns let your drums be still
p4310
aVFor here we entertain a solemn peace
p4311
aVYour wondrous rare description noble earl
p4312
aVOf beauteous Margaret hath astonished me
p4313
aVHer virtues gracèd with external gifts
p4314
aVDo breed love\u2019s settled passions in my heart
p4315
aVAnd like as rigor of tempestuous gusts
p4316
aVProvokes the mightiest hulk against the tide
p4317
aVSo am I driven by breath of her renown
p4318
aVEither to suffer shipwrack or arrive
p4319
aVWhere I may have fruition of her love
p4320
aVTush my good lord this superficial tale
p4321
aVIs but a preface of her worthy praise
p4322
aVThe chief perfections of that lovely dame
p4323
aVHad I sufficient skill to utter them
p4324
aVWould make a volume of enticing lines
p4325
aVAble to ravish any dull conceit
p4326
aVAnd which is more she is not so divine
p4327
aVSo full replete with choice of all delights
p4328
aVBut with as humble lowliness of mind
p4329
aVShe is content to be at your command
p4330
aVCommand I mean of virtuous chaste intents
p4331
aVTo love and honor Henry as her lord
p4332
aVAnd otherwise will Henry ne\u2019er presume
p4333
aVTherefore my Lord Protector give consent
p4334
aVThat Margaret may be England\u2019s royal queen
p4335
aVSo should I give consent to flatter sin
p4336
aVYou know my lord your Highness is betrothed
p4337
aVUnto another lady of esteem
p4338
aVHow shall we then dispense with that contract
p4339
aVAnd not deface your honor with reproach
p4340
aVAs doth a ruler with unlawful oaths
p4341
aVOr one that at a triumph having vowed
p4342
aVTo try his strength forsaketh yet the lists
p4343
aVBy reason of his adversary\u2019s odds
p4344
aVA poor earl\u2019s daughter is unequal odds
p4345
aVAnd therefore may be broke without offense
p4346
aVWhy what I pray is Margaret more than that
p4347
aVHer father is no better than an earl
p4348
aVAlthough in glorious titles he excel
p4349
aVYes my lord her father is a king
p4350
aVThe King of Naples and Jerusalem
p4351
aVAnd of such great authority in France
p4352
aVAs his alliance will confirm our peace
p4353
aVAnd keep the Frenchmen in allegiance
p4354
aVAnd so the Earl of Armagnac may do
p4355
aVBecause he is near kinsman unto Charles
p4356
aVBesides his wealth doth warrant a liberal dower
p4357
aVWhere Reignier sooner will receive than give
p4358
aVA dower my lords Disgrace not so your king
p4359
aVThat he should be so abject base and poor
p4360
aVTo choose for wealth and not for perfect love
p4361
aVHenry is able to enrich his queen
p4362
aVAnd not to seek a queen to make him rich
p4363
aVSo worthless peasants bargain for their wives
p4364
aVAs market men for oxen sheep or horse
p4365
aVMarriage is a matter of more worth
p4366
aVThan to be dealt in by attorneyship
p4367
aVNot whom we will but whom his Grace affects
p4368
aVMust be companion of his nuptial bed
p4369
aVAnd therefore lords since he affects her most
p4370
aVMost of all these reasons bindeth us
p4371
aVIn our opinions she should be preferred
p4372
aVFor what is wedlock forcèd but a hell
p4373
aVAn age of discord and continual strife
p4374
aVWhereas the contrary bringeth bliss
p4375
aVAnd is a pattern of celestial peace
p4376
aVWhom should we match with Henry being a king
p4377
aVBut Margaret that is daughter to a king
p4378
aVHer peerless feature joinèd with her birth
p4379
aVApproves her fit for none but for a king
p4380
aVHer valiant courage and undaunted spirit
p4381
aVMore than in women commonly is seen
p4382
aVWill answer our hope in issue of a king
p4383
aVFor Henry son unto a conqueror
p4384
aVIs likely to beget more conquerors
p4385
aVIf with a lady of so high resolve
p4386
aVAs is fair Margaret he be linked in love
p4387
aVThen yield my lords and here conclude with me
p4388
aVThat Margaret shall be queen and none but she
p4389
aVWhether it be through force of your report
p4390
aVMy noble Lord of Suffolk or for that
p4391
aVMy tender youth was never yet attaint
p4392
aVWith any passion of inflaming love
p4393
aVI cannot tell but this I am assured
p4394
aVI feel such sharp dissension in my breast
p4395
aVSuch fierce alarums both of hope and fear
p4396
aVAs I am sick with working of my thoughts
p4397
aVTake therefore shipping post my lord to France
p4398
aVAgree to any covenants and procure
p4399
aVThat Lady Margaret do vouchsafe to come
p4400
aVTo cross the seas to England and be crowned
p4401
aVKing Henry\u2019s faithful and anointed queen
p4402
aVFor your expenses and sufficient charge
p4403
aVAmong the people gather up a tenth
p4404
aVBe gone I say for till you do return
p4405
aVI rest perplexèd with a thousand cares
p4406
aVAnd you good uncle banish all offense
p4407
aVIf you do censure me by what you were
p4408
aVNot what you are I know it will excuse
p4409
aVThis sudden execution of my will
p4410
aVAnd so conduct me where from company
p4411
aVI may revolve and ruminate my grief
p4412
aVAy grief I fear me both at first and last
p4413
aVThus Suffolk hath prevailed and thus he goes
p4414
aVAs did the youthful Paris once to Greece
p4415
aVWith hope to find the like event in love
p4416
aVBut prosper better than the Trojan did
p4417
aVMargaret shall now be queen and rule the King
p4418
aVBut I will rule both her the King and realm
p4419
aVOpen your ears for which of you will stop
p4420
aVThe vent of hearing when loud Rumor speaks
p4421
aVI from the orient to the drooping west
p4422
aVMaking the wind my post-horse still unfold
p4423
aVThe acts commencèd on this ball of earth
p4424
aVUpon my tongues continual slanders ride
p4425
aVThe which in every language I pronounce
p4426
aVStuffing the ears of men with false reports
p4427
aVI speak of peace while covert enmity
p4428
aVUnder the smile of safety wounds the world
p4429
aVAnd who but Rumor who but only I
p4430
aVMake fearful musters and prepared defense
p4431
aVWhiles the big year swoll\u2019n with some other grief
p4432
aVIs thought with child by the stern tyrant war
p4433
aVAnd no such matter Rumor is a pipe
p4434
aVBlown by surmises jealousies conjectures
p4435
aVAnd of so easy and so plain a stop
p4436
aVThat the blunt monster with uncounted heads
p4437
aVThe still-discordant wav\u2019ring multitude
p4438
aVCan play upon it But what need I thus
p4439
aVMy well-known body to anatomize
p4440
aVAmong my household Why is Rumor here
p4441
aVI run before King Harry\u2019s victory
p4442
aVWho in a bloody field by Shrewsbury
p4443
aVHath beaten down young Hotspur and his troops
p4444
aVQuenching the flame of bold rebellion
p4445
aVEven with the rebels\u2019 blood But what mean I
p4446
aVTo speak so true at first My office is
p4447
aVTo noise abroad that Harry Monmouth fell
p4448
aVUnder the wrath of noble Hotspur\u2019s sword
p4449
aVAnd that the King before the Douglas\u2019 rage
p4450
aVStooped his anointed head as low as death
p4451
aVThis have I rumored through the peasant towns
p4452
aVBetween that royal field of Shrewsbury
p4453
aVAnd this worm-eaten hold of ragged stone
p4454
aVWhere Hotspur\u2019s father old Northumberland
p4455
aVLies crafty-sick The posts come tiring on
p4456
aVAnd not a man of them brings other news
p4457
aVThan they have learnt of me From Rumor\u2019s tongues
p4458
aVThey bring smooth comforts false worse than true wrongs
p4459
aVWho keeps the gate here ho
p4460
aVWhere is the Earl
p4461
aVWhat shall I say you are
p4462
aVTell thou the Earl
p4463
aVThat the Lord Bardolph doth attend him here
p4464
aVHis Lordship is walked forth into the orchard
p4465
aVPlease it your Honor knock but at the gate
p4466
aVAnd he himself will answer
p4467
aVHere comes the Earl
p4468
aVWhat news Lord Bardolph Every minute now
p4469
aVShould be the father of some stratagem
p4470
aVThe times are wild Contention like a horse
p4471
aVFull of high feeding madly hath broke loose
p4472
aVAnd bears down all before him
p4473
aVNoble earl
p4474

p4475
aVGood an God will
p4476
aVAs good as heart can wish
p4477
aVThe King is almost wounded to the death
p4478
aVAnd in the fortune of my lord your son
p4479
aVPrince Harry slain outright and both the Blunts
p4480
aVKilled by the hand of Douglas young Prince John
p4481
aVAnd Westmoreland and Stafford fled the field
p4482
aVAnd Harry Monmouth\u2019s brawn the hulk Sir John
p4483
aVIs prisoner to your son O such a day
p4484
aVSo fought so followed and so fairly won
p4485
aVCame not till now to dignify the times
p4486
aVSince Caesar\u2019s fortunes
p4487
aVHow is this derived
p4488
aVSaw you the field Came you from Shrewsbury
p4489
aVI spake with one my lord that came from thence
p4490
aVA gentleman well bred and of good name
p4491
aVThat freely rendered me these news for true
p4492
aVHere comes my servant Travers who I sent
p4493
aVOn Tuesday last to listen after news
p4494
aVMy lord I overrode him on the way
p4495
aVAnd he is furnished with no certainties
p4496
aVMore than he haply may retail from me
p4497
aVNow Travers what good tidings comes with you
p4498
aVMy lord Sir John Umfrevile turned me back
p4499
aVWith joyful tidings and being better horsed
p4500
aVOutrode me After him came spurring hard
p4501
aVA gentleman almost forspent with speed
p4502
aVThat stopped by me to breathe his bloodied horse
p4503
aVHe asked the way to Chester and of him
p4504
aVI did demand what news from Shrewsbury
p4505
aVHe told me that rebellion had bad luck
p4506
aVAnd that young Harry Percy\u2019s spur was cold
p4507
aVWith that he gave his able horse the head
p4508
aVAnd bending forward struck his armèd heels
p4509
aVAgainst the panting sides of his poor jade
p4510
aVUp to the rowel-head and starting so
p4511
aVHe seemed in running to devour the way
p4512
aVStaying no longer question
p4513
aVHa Again
p4514
aVSaid he young Harry Percy\u2019s spur was cold
p4515
aVOf Hotspur Coldspur That rebellion
p4516
aVHad met ill luck
p4517
aVMy lord I\u2019ll tell you what
p4518
aVIf my young lord your son have not the day
p4519
aVUpon mine honor for a silken point
p4520
aVI\u2019ll give my barony Never talk of it
p4521
aVWhy should that gentleman that rode by Travers
p4522
aVGive then such instances of loss
p4523
aVWho he
p4524
aVHe was some hilding fellow that had stol\u2019n
p4525
aVThe horse he rode on and upon my life
p4526
aVSpoke at a venture
p4527
aVLook here comes more news
p4528
aVYea this man\u2019s brow like to a title leaf
p4529
aVForetells the nature of a tragic volume
p4530
aVSo looks the strand whereon the imperious flood
p4531
aVHath left a witnessed usurpation
p4532
aVSay Morton didst thou come from Shrewsbury
p4533
aVI ran from Shrewsbury my noble lord
p4534
aVWhere hateful death put on his ugliest mask
p4535
aVTo fright our party
p4536
aVHow doth my son and brother
p4537
aVThou tremblest and the whiteness in thy cheek
p4538
aVIs apter than thy tongue to tell thy errand
p4539
aVEven such a man so faint so spiritless
p4540
aVSo dull so dead in look so woebegone
p4541
aVDrew Priam\u2019s curtain in the dead of night
p4542
aVAnd would have told him half his Troy was burnt
p4543
aVBut Priam found the fire ere he his tongue
p4544
aVAnd I my Percy\u2019s death ere thou report\u2019st it
p4545
aVThis thou wouldst say Your son did thus and thus
p4546
aVYour brother thus so fought the noble Douglas
p4547
aVStopping my greedy ear with their bold deeds
p4548
aVBut in the end to stop my ear indeed
p4549
aVThou hast a sigh to blow away this praise
p4550
aVEnding with Brother son and all are dead
p4551
aVDouglas is living and your brother yet
p4552
aVBut for my lord your son
p4553
aVWhy he is dead
p4554
aVSee what a ready tongue suspicion hath
p4555
aVHe that but fears the thing he would not know
p4556
aVHath by instinct knowledge from others\u2019 eyes
p4557
aVThat what he feared is chancèd Yet speak Morton
p4558
aVTell thou an earl his divination lies
p4559
aVAnd I will take it as a sweet disgrace
p4560
aVAnd make thee rich for doing me such wrong
p4561
aVYou are too great to be by me gainsaid
p4562
aVYour spirit is too true your fears too certain
p4563
aVYet for all this say not that Percy\u2019s dead
p4564
aVI see a strange confession in thine eye
p4565
aVThou shak\u2019st thy head and hold\u2019st it fear or sin
p4566
aVTo speak a truth If he be slain say so
p4567
aVThe tongue offends not that reports his death
p4568
aVAnd he doth sin that doth belie the dead
p4569
aVNot he which says the dead is not alive
p4570
aVYet the first bringer of unwelcome news
p4571
aVHath but a losing office and his tongue
p4572
aVSounds ever after as a sullen bell
p4573
aVRemembered tolling a departing friend
p4574
aVI cannot think my lord your son is dead
p4575
aVI am sorry I should force you to believe
p4576
aVThat which I would to God I had not seen
p4577
aVBut these mine eyes saw him in bloody state
p4578
aVRend\u2019ring faint quittance wearied and outbreathed
p4579
aVTo Harry Monmouth whose swift wrath beat down
p4580
aVThe never-daunted Percy to the earth
p4581
aVFrom whence with life he never more sprung up
p4582
aVIn few his death whose spirit lent a fire
p4583
aVEven to the dullest peasant in his camp
p4584
aVBeing bruited once took fire and heat away
p4585
aVFrom the best-tempered courage in his troops
p4586
aVFor from his mettle was his party steeled
p4587
aVWhich once in him abated all the rest
p4588
aVTurned on themselves like dull and heavy lead
p4589
aVAnd as the thing that\u2019s heavy in itself
p4590
aVUpon enforcement flies with greatest speed
p4591
aVSo did our men heavy in Hotspur\u2019s loss
p4592
aVLend to this weight such lightness with their fear
p4593
aVThat arrows fled not swifter toward their aim
p4594
aVThan did our soldiers aiming at their safety
p4595
aVFly from the field Then was that noble Worcester
p4596
aVSo soon ta\u2019en prisoner and that furious Scot
p4597
aVThe bloody Douglas whose well-laboring sword
p4598
aVHad three times slain th\u2019 appearance of the King
p4599
aVGan vail his stomach and did grace the shame
p4600
aVOf those that turned their backs and in his flight
p4601
aVStumbling in fear was took The sum of all
p4602
aVIs that the King hath won and hath sent out
p4603
aVA speedy power to encounter you my lord
p4604
aVUnder the conduct of young Lancaster
p4605
aVAnd Westmoreland This is the news at full
p4606
aVFor this I shall have time enough to mourn
p4607
aVIn poison there is physic and these news
p4608
aVHaving been well that would have made me sick
p4609
aVBeing sick have in some measure made me well
p4610
aVAnd as the wretch whose fever-weakened joints
p4611
aVLike strengthless hinges buckle under life
p4612
aVImpatient of his fit breaks like a fire
p4613
aVOut of his keeper\u2019s arms even so my limbs
p4614
aVWeakened with grief being now enraged with grief
p4615
aVAre thrice themselves Hence therefore thou nice crutch
p4616
aVA scaly gauntlet now with joints of steel
p4617
aVMust glove this hand And hence thou sickly coif
p4618
aVThou art a guard too wanton for the head
p4619
aVWhich princes fleshed with conquest aim to hit
p4620
aVNow bind my brows with iron and approach
p4621
aVThe ragged\u2019st hour that time and spite dare bring
p4622
aVTo frown upon th\u2019 enraged Northumberland
p4623
aVLet heaven kiss Earth Now let not Nature\u2019s hand
p4624
aVKeep the wild flood confined Let order die
p4625
aVAnd let this world no longer be a stage
p4626
aVTo feed contention in a lingering act
p4627
aVBut let one spirit of the firstborn Cain
p4628
aVReign in all bosoms that each heart being set
p4629
aVOn bloody courses the rude scene may end
p4630
aVAnd darkness be the burier of the dead
p4631
aVThis strainèd passion doth you wrong my lord
p4632
aVSweet earl divorce not wisdom from your honor
p4633
aVThe lives of all your loving complices
p4634
aVLean on your health the which if you give o\u2019er
p4635
aVTo stormy passion must perforce decay
p4636
aVYou cast th\u2019 event of war my noble lord
p4637
aVAnd summed the accompt of chance before you said
p4638
aVLet us make head It was your presurmise
p4639
aVThat in the dole of blows your son might drop
p4640
aVYou knew he walked o\u2019er perils on an edge
p4641
aVMore likely to fall in than to get o\u2019er
p4642
aVYou were advised his flesh was capable
p4643
aVOf wounds and scars and that his forward spirit
p4644
aVWould lift him where most trade of danger ranged
p4645
aVYet did you say Go forth and none of this
p4646
aVThough strongly apprehended could restrain
p4647
aVThe stiff-borne action What hath then befall\u2019n
p4648
aVOr what did this bold enterprise bring forth
p4649
aVMore than that being which was like to be
p4650
aVWe all that are engagèd to this loss
p4651
aVKnew that we ventured on such dangerous seas
p4652
aVThat if we wrought out life \u2019twas ten to one
p4653
aVAnd yet we ventured for the gain proposed
p4654
aVChoked the respect of likely peril feared
p4655
aVAnd since we are o\u2019erset venture again
p4656
aVCome we will all put forth body and goods
p4657
aV\u2019Tis more than time And my most noble lord
p4658
aVI hear for certain and dare speak the truth
p4659
aVThe gentle Archbishop of York is up
p4660
aVWith well-appointed powers He is a man
p4661
aVWho with a double surety binds his followers
p4662
aVMy lord your son had only but the corpse
p4663
aVBut shadows and the shows of men to fight
p4664
aVFor that same word rebellion did divide
p4665
aVThe action of their bodies from their souls
p4666
aVAnd they did fight with queasiness constrained
p4667
aVAs men drink potions that their weapons only
p4668
aVSeemed on our side But for their spirits and souls
p4669
aVThis word rebellion it had froze them up
p4670
aVAs fish are in a pond But now the Bishop
p4671
aVTurns insurrection to religion
p4672
aVSupposed sincere and holy in his thoughts
p4673
aVHe\u2019s followed both with body and with mind
p4674
aVAnd doth enlarge his rising with the blood
p4675
aVOf fair King Richard scraped from Pomfret stones
p4676
aVDerives from heaven his quarrel and his cause
p4677
aVTells them he doth bestride a bleeding land
p4678
aVGasping for life under great Bolingbroke
p4679
aVAnd more and less do flock to follow him
p4680
aVI knew of this before but to speak truth
p4681
aVThis present grief had wiped it from my mind
p4682
aVGo in with me and counsel every man
p4683
aVThe aptest way for safety and revenge
p4684
aVGet posts and letters and make friends with speed
p4685
aVNever so few and never yet more need
p4686
aVThus have you heard our cause and known our means
p4687
aVAnd my most noble friends I pray you all
p4688
aVSpeak plainly your opinions of our hopes
p4689
aVAnd first Lord Marshal what say you to it
p4690
aVI well allow the occasion of our arms
p4691
aVBut gladly would be better satisfied
p4692
aVHow in our means we should advance ourselves
p4693
aVTo look with forehead bold and big enough
p4694
aVUpon the power and puissance of the King
p4695
aVOur present musters grow upon the file
p4696
aVTo five-and-twenty thousand men of choice
p4697
aVAnd our supplies live largely in the hope
p4698
aVOf great Northumberland whose bosom burns
p4699
aVWith an incensèd fire of injuries
p4700
aVThe question then Lord Hastings standeth thus
p4701
aVWhether our present five-and-twenty thousand
p4702
aVMay hold up head without Northumberland
p4703
aVWith him we may
p4704
aVYea marry there\u2019s the point
p4705
aVBut if without him we be thought too feeble
p4706
aVMy judgment is we should not step too far
p4707
aVTill we had his assistance by the hand
p4708
aVFor in a theme so bloody-faced as this
p4709
aVConjecture expectation and surmise
p4710
aVOf aids incertain should not be admitted
p4711
aV\u2019Tis very true Lord Bardolph for indeed
p4712
aVIt was young Hotspur\u2019s cause at Shrewsbury
p4713
aVIt was my lord who lined himself with hope
p4714
aVEating the air and promise of supply
p4715
aVFlatt\u2019ring himself in project of a power
p4716
aVMuch smaller than the smallest of his thoughts
p4717
aVAnd so with great imagination
p4718
aVProper to madmen led his powers to death
p4719
aVAnd winking leapt into destruction
p4720
aVBut by your leave it never yet did hurt
p4721
aVTo lay down likelihoods and forms of hope
p4722
aVYes if this present quality of war
p4723
aVIndeed the instant action a cause on foot
p4724
aVLives so in hope as in an early spring
p4725
aVWe see th\u2019 appearing buds which to prove fruit
p4726
aVHope gives not so much warrant as despair
p4727
aVThat frosts will bite them When we mean to build
p4728
aVWe first survey the plot then draw the model
p4729
aVAnd when we see the figure of the house
p4730
aVThen must we rate the cost of the erection
p4731
aVWhich if we find outweighs ability
p4732
aVWhat do we then but draw anew the model
p4733
aVIn fewer offices or at least desist
p4734
aVTo build at all Much more in this great work
p4735
aVWhich is almost to pluck a kingdom down
p4736
aVAnd set another up should we survey
p4737
aVThe plot of situation and the model
p4738
aVConsent upon a sure foundation
p4739
aVQuestion surveyors know our own estate
p4740
aVHow able such a work to undergo
p4741
aVTo weigh against his opposite Or else
p4742
aVWe fortify in paper and in figures
p4743
aVUsing the names of men instead of men
p4744
aVLike one that draws the model of an house
p4745
aVBeyond his power to build it who half through
p4746
aVGives o\u2019er and leaves his part-created cost
p4747
aVA naked subject to the weeping clouds
p4748
aVAnd waste for churlish winter\u2019s tyranny
p4749
aVGrant that our hopes yet likely of fair birth
p4750
aVShould be stillborn and that we now possessed
p4751
aVThe utmost man of expectation
p4752
aVI think we are a body strong enough
p4753
aVEven as we are to equal with the King
p4754
aVWhat is the King but five-and-twenty thousand
p4755
aVTo us no more nay not so much Lord Bardolph
p4756
aVFor his divisions as the times do brawl
p4757
aVAre in three heads one power against the French
p4758
aVAnd one against Glendower perforce a third
p4759
aVMust take up us So is the unfirm king
p4760
aVIn three divided and his coffers sound
p4761
aVWith hollow poverty and emptiness
p4762
aVThat he should draw his several strengths together
p4763
aVAnd come against us in full puissance
p4764
aVNeed not to be dreaded
p4765
aVIf he should do so
p4766
aVHe leaves his back unarmed the French and Welsh
p4767
aVBaying him at the heels Never fear that
p4768
aVWho is it like should lead his forces hither
p4769
aVThe Duke of Lancaster and Westmoreland
p4770
aVAgainst the Welsh himself and Harry Monmouth
p4771
aVBut who is substituted against the French
p4772
aVI have no certain notice
p4773
aVLet us on
p4774
aVAnd publish the occasion of our arms
p4775
aVThe commonwealth is sick of their own choice
p4776
aVTheir over-greedy love hath surfeited
p4777
aVAn habitation giddy and unsure
p4778
aVHath he that buildeth on the vulgar heart
p4779
aVO thou fond many with what loud applause
p4780
aVDidst thou beat heaven with blessing Bolingbroke
p4781
aVBefore he was what thou wouldst have him be
p4782
aVAnd being now trimmed in thine own desires
p4783
aVThou beastly feeder art so full of him
p4784
aVThat thou provok\u2019st thyself to cast him up
p4785
aVSo so thou common dog didst thou disgorge
p4786
aVThy glutton bosom of the royal Richard
p4787
aVAnd now thou wouldst eat thy dead vomit up
p4788
aVAnd howl\u2019st to find it What trust is in these times
p4789
aVThey that when Richard lived would have him die
p4790
aVAre now become enamored on his grave
p4791
aVThou that threw\u2019st dust upon his goodly head
p4792
aVWhen through proud London he came sighing on
p4793
aVAfter th\u2019 admirèd heels of Bolingbroke
p4794
aVCriest now O earth yield us that king again
p4795
aVAnd take thou this O thoughts of men accursed
p4796
aVPast and to come seems best things present worst
p4797
aVShall we go draw our numbers and set on
p4798
aVWe are time\u2019s subjects and time bids begone
p4799
aVWhat is the matter Keep the peace here ho
p4800
aVHow now Sir John What are you brawling here
p4801
aVDoth this become your place your time and business
p4802
aVYou should have been well on your way to York
p4803
aVThe King my lord and Harry Prince of Wales
p4804
aVAre near at hand The rest the paper tells
p4805
aVNo Fifteen hundred foot five hundred horse
p4806
aVAre marched up to my Lord of Lancaster
p4807
aVAgainst Northumberland and the Archbishop

aVComes the King back from Wales my noble lord
p4809
aVYou shall have letters of me presently
p4810
aVCome Go along with me good Master Gower

aVDo what you will your wisdom be your guide
p4817
aVAlas sweet wife my honor is at pawn
p4818
aVAnd but my going nothing can redeem it
p4819
aVO yet for God\u2019s sake go not to these wars
p4820
aVThe time was father that you broke your word
p4821
aVWhen you were more endeared to it than now
p4822
aVWhen your own Percy when my heart\u2019s dear Harry
p4823
aVThrew many a northward look to see his father
p4824
aVBring up his powers but he did long in vain
p4825
aVWho then persuaded you to stay at home
p4826
aVThere were two honors lost yours and your son\u2019s
p4827
aVFor yours the God of heaven brighten it
p4828
aVFor his it stuck upon him as the sun
p4829
aVIn the gray vault of heaven and by his light
p4830
aVDid all the chivalry of England move
p4831
aVTo do brave acts He was indeed the glass
p4832
aVWherein the noble youth did dress themselves
p4833
aVHe had no legs that practiced not his gait
p4834
aVAnd speaking thick which nature made his blemish
p4835
aVBecame the accents of the valiant
p4836
aVFor those that could speak low and tardily
p4837
aVWould turn their own perfection to abuse
p4838
aVTo seem like him So that in speech in gait
p4839
aVIn diet in affections of delight
p4840
aVIn military rules humors of blood
p4841
aVHe was the mark and glass copy and book
p4842
aVThat fashioned others And him O wondrous him
p4843
aVO miracle of men him did you leave
p4844
aVSecond to none unseconded by you
p4845
aVTo look upon the hideous god of war
p4846
aVIn disadvantage to abide a field
p4847
aVWhere nothing but the sound of Hotspur\u2019s name
p4848
aVDid seem defensible So you left him
p4849
aVNever O never do his ghost the wrong
p4850
aVTo hold your honor more precise and nice
p4851
aVWith others than with him Let them alone
p4852
aVThe Marshal and the Archbishop are strong
p4853
aVHad my sweet Harry had but half their numbers
p4854
aVToday might I hanging on Hotspur\u2019s neck

aVHave talked of Monmouth\u2019s grave

aVFair daughter you do draw my spirits from me

aVOr it will seek me in another place
p4861
aVAnd find me worse provided

aVO fly to Scotland
p4863
aVTill that the nobles and the armèd commons
p4864
aVHave of their puissance made a little taste
p4865
aVIf they get ground and vantage of the King
p4866
aVThen join you with them like a rib of steel
p4867
aVTo make strength stronger but for all our loves
p4868
aVFirst let them try themselves So did your son
p4869
aVHe was so suffered So came I a widow
p4870
aVAnd never shall have length of life enough
p4871
aVTo rain upon remembrance with mine eyes
p4872
aVThat it may grow and sprout as high as heaven
p4873
aVFor recordation to my noble husband
p4874
aVCome come go in with me \u2019Tis with my mind
p4875
aVAs with the tide swelled up unto his height
p4876

aVThe King your father is at Westminster
p4883
aVAnd there are twenty weak and wearied posts
p4884
aVCome from the north and as I came along
p4885
aVI met and overtook a dozen captains
p4886
aVBareheaded sweating knocking at the taverns
p4887
aVAnd asking everyone for Sir John Falstaff
p4888
aVBy heaven Poins I feel me much to blame
p4889
aVSo idly to profane the precious time
p4890
aVWhen tempest of commotion like the south
p4891
aVBorne with black vapor doth begin to melt
p4892
aVAnd drop upon our bare unarmèd heads
p4893
aVGive me my sword and cloak Falstaff good night
p4894
aVYou must away to court sir presently
p4895
aVA dozen captains stay at door for you
p4896
aVGo call the Earls of Surrey and of Warwick
p4897
aVBut ere they come bid them o\u2019erread these letters
p4898
aVAnd well consider of them Make good speed
p4899
aVHow many thousand of my poorest subjects
p4900
aVAre at this hour asleep O sleep O gentle sleep
p4901
aVNature\u2019s soft nurse how have I frighted thee
p4902
aVThat thou no more wilt weigh my eyelids down
p4903
aVAnd steep my senses in forgetfulness
p4904
aVWhy rather sleep liest thou in smoky cribs
p4905
aVUpon uneasy pallets stretching thee
p4906
aVAnd hushed with buzzing night-flies to thy slumber
p4907
aVThan in the perfumed chambers of the great
p4908
aVUnder the canopies of costly state
p4909
aVAnd lulled with sound of sweetest melody
p4910
aVO thou dull god why liest thou with the vile
p4911
aVIn loathsome beds and leavest the kingly couch
p4912
aVA watch-case or a common \u2019larum bell
p4913
aVWilt thou upon the high and giddy mast
p4914
aVSeal up the shipboy\u2019s eyes and rock his brains
p4915
aVIn cradle of the rude imperious surge
p4916
aVAnd in the visitation of the winds
p4917
aVWho take the ruffian billows by the top
p4918
aVCurling their monstrous heads and hanging them
p4919
aVWith deafing clamor in the slippery clouds
p4920
aVThat with the hurly death itself awakes
p4921
aVCanst thou O partial sleep give thy repose
p4922
aVTo the wet sea-boy in an hour so rude
p4923
aVAnd in the calmest and most stillest night
p4924
aVWith all appliances and means to boot

aV\u2019Tis one o\u2019clock and past
p4930
aVWhy then good morrow to you all my lords
p4931
aVHave you read o\u2019er the letter that I sent you
p4932
aVWe have my liege
p4933
aVThen you perceive the body of our kingdom
p4934
aVHow foul it is what rank diseases grow
p4935
aVAnd with what danger near the heart of it
p4936
aVIt is but as a body yet distempered
p4937
aVWhich to his former strength may be restored
p4938
aVWith good advice and little medicine
p4939
aVMy Lord Northumberland will soon be cooled
p4940
aVO God that one might read the book of fate
p4941
aVAnd see the revolution of the times
p4942
aVMake mountains level and the continent
p4943
aVWeary of solid firmness melt itself
p4944
aVInto the sea and other times to see
p4945
aVThe beachy girdle of the ocean
p4946
aVToo wide for Neptune\u2019s hips how chance\u2019s mocks
p4947
aVAnd changes fill the cup of alteration
p4948
aVWith divers liquors O if this were seen
p4949
aVThe happiest youth viewing his progress through
p4950
aVWhat perils past what crosses to ensue
p4951
aVWould shut the book and sit him down and die
p4952
aV\u2019Tis not ten years gone
p4953
aVSince Richard and Northumberland great friends
p4954
aVDid feast together and in two years after
p4955
aVWere they at wars It is but eight years since
p4956
aVThis Percy was the man nearest my soul
p4957
aVWho like a brother toiled in my affairs
p4958
aVAnd laid his love and life under my foot
p4959
aVYea for my sake even to the eyes of Richard
p4960
aVGave him defiance But which of you was by
p4961
aVTo Warwick You cousin Nevil as I may remember
p4962
aVWhen Richard with his eye brimful of tears
p4963
aVThen checked and rated by Northumberland
p4964
aVDid speak these words now proved a prophecy
p4965
aVNorthumberland thou ladder by the which
p4966
aVMy cousin Bolingbroke ascends my throne
p4967
aVThough then God knows I had no such intent
p4968
aVBut that necessity so bowed the state
p4969
aVThat I and greatness were compelled to kiss
p4970
aVThe time shall come thus did he follow it
p4971
aVThe time will come that foul sin gathering head
p4972
aVShall break into corruption so went on
p4973
aVForetelling this same time\u2019s condition
p4974
aVAnd the division of our amity
p4975
aVThere is a history in all men\u2019s lives
p4976
aVFiguring the natures of the times deceased
p4977
aVThe which observed a man may prophesy
p4978
aVWith a near aim of the main chance of things
p4979
aVAs yet not come to life who in their seeds
p4980
aVAnd weak beginning lie intreasurèd
p4981
aVSuch things become the hatch and brood of time
p4982
aVAnd by the necessary form of this
p4983
aVKing Richard might create a perfect guess
p4984
aVThat great Northumberland then false to him
p4985
aVWould of that seed grow to a greater falseness
p4986
aVWhich should not find a ground to root upon
p4987
aVUnless on you
p4988
aVAre these things then necessities
p4989
aVThen let us meet them like necessities
p4990
aVAnd that same word even now cries out on us
p4991
aVThey say the Bishop and Northumberland
p4992
aVAre fifty thousand strong
p4993
aVIt cannot be my lord
p4994
aVRumor doth double like the voice and echo
p4995
aVThe numbers of the feared Please it your Grace
p4996
aVTo go to bed Upon my soul my lord
p4997
aVThe powers that you already have sent forth
p4998
aVShall bring this prize in very easily
p4999
aVTo comfort you the more I have received
p5000
aVA certain instance that Glendower is dead
p5001
aVYour Majesty hath been this fortnight ill
p5002
aVAnd these unseasoned hours perforce must add
p5003
aVUnto your sickness
p5004
aVI will take your counsel
p5005
aVAnd were these inward wars once out of hand
p5006
aVWe would dear lords unto the Holy Land
p5007
aVWhat is this forest called
p5008
aV\u2019Tis Gaultree Forest an \u2019t shall please your Grace
p5009
aVHere stand my lords and send discoverers forth
p5010
aVTo know the numbers of our enemies
p5011
aVWe have sent forth already
p5012
aV\u2019Tis well done
p5013
aVMy friends and brethren in these great affairs
p5014
aVI must acquaint you that I have received
p5015
aVNew-dated letters from Northumberland
p5016
aVTheir cold intent tenor and substance thus
p5017
aVHere doth he wish his person with such powers
p5018
aVAs might hold sortance with his quality
p5019
aVThe which he could not levy whereupon
p5020
aVHe is retired to ripe his growing fortunes
p5021
aVTo Scotland and concludes in hearty prayers
p5022
aVThat your attempts may overlive the hazard
p5023
aVAnd fearful meeting of their opposite
p5024
aVThus do the hopes we have in him touch ground
p5025
aVAnd dash themselves to pieces
p5026
aVNow what news
p5027
aVWest of this forest scarcely off a mile
p5028
aVIn goodly form comes on the enemy
p5029
aVAnd by the ground they hide I judge their number
p5030
aVUpon or near the rate of thirty thousand
p5031
aVThe just proportion that we gave them out
p5032
aVLet us sway on and face them in the field
p5033
aVWhat well-appointed leader fronts us here
p5034
aVI think it is my Lord of Westmoreland
p5035
aVHealth and fair greeting from our general
p5036
aVThe Prince Lord John and Duke of Lancaster
p5037
aVSay on my Lord of Westmoreland in peace
p5038
aVWhat doth concern your coming
p5039
aVThen my lord
p5040
aVUnto your Grace do I in chief address
p5041
aVThe substance of my speech If that rebellion
p5042
aVCame like itself in base and abject routs
p5043
aVLed on by bloody youth guarded with rage
p5044
aVAnd countenanced by boys and beggary
p5045
aVI say if damned commotion so appeared
p5046
aVIn his true native and most proper shape
p5047
aVYou reverend father and these noble lords
p5048
aVHad not been here to dress the ugly form
p5049
aVOf base and bloody insurrection
p5050
aVWith your fair honors You Lord Archbishop
p5051
aVWhose see is by a civil peace maintained
p5052
aVWhose beard the silver hand of peace hath touched
p5053
aVWhose learning and good letters peace hath tutored
p5054
aVWhose white investments figure innocence
p5055
aVThe dove and very blessèd spirit of peace
p5056
aVWherefore do you so ill translate yourself
p5057
aVOut of the speech of peace that bears such grace
p5058
aVInto the harsh and boist\u2019rous tongue of war
p5059
aVTurning your books to graves your ink to blood
p5060
aVYour pens to lances and your tongue divine
p5061
aVTo a loud trumpet and a point of war
p5062
aVWherefore do I this So the question stands
p5063
aVBriefly to this end we are all diseased
p5064
aVAnd with our surfeiting and wanton hours
p5065
aVHave brought ourselves into a burning fever
p5066
aVAnd we must bleed for it of which disease
p5067
aVOur late King Richard being infected died
p5068
aVBut my most noble Lord of Westmoreland
p5069
aVI take not on me here as a physician
p5070
aVNor do I as an enemy to peace
p5071
aVTroop in the throngs of military men
p5072
aVBut rather show awhile like fearful war
p5073
aVTo diet rank minds sick of happiness
p5074
aVAnd purge th\u2019 obstructions which begin to stop
p5075
aVOur very veins of life Hear me more plainly
p5076
aVI have in equal balance justly weighed
p5077
aVWhat wrongs our arms may do what wrongs we suffer
p5078
aVAnd find our griefs heavier than our offenses
p5079
aVWe see which way the stream of time doth run
p5080
aVAnd are enforced from our most quiet there
p5081
aVBy the rough torrent of occasion
p5082
aVAnd have the summary of all our griefs
p5083
aVWhen time shall serve to show in articles
p5084
aVWhich long ere this we offered to the King
p5085
aVAnd might by no suit gain our audience
p5086
aVWhen we are wronged and would unfold our griefs
p5087
aVWe are denied access unto his person
p5088
aVEven by those men that most have done us wrong
p5089
aVThe dangers of the days but newly gone
p5090
aVWhose memory is written on the earth
p5091
aVWith yet-appearing blood and the examples
p5092
aVOf every minute\u2019s instance present now
p5093
aVHath put us in these ill-beseeming arms
p5094
aVNot to break peace or any branch of it
p5095
aVBut to establish here a peace indeed
p5096
aVConcurring both in name and quality
p5097
aVWhenever yet was your appeal denied
p5098
aVWherein have you been gallèd by the King
p5099
aVWhat peer hath been suborned to grate on you
p5100
aVThat you should seal this lawless bloody book
p5101
aVOf forged rebellion with a seal divine
p5102
aVAnd consecrate commotion\u2019s bitter edge
p5103
aVMy brother general the commonwealth
p5104
aVTo brother born an household cruelty
p5105
aVI make my quarrel in particular
p5106
aVThere is no need of any such redress
p5107
aVOr if there were it not belongs to you
p5108
aVWhy not to him in part and to us all
p5109
aVThat feel the bruises of the days before
p5110
aVAnd suffer the condition of these times
p5111
aVTo lay a heavy and unequal hand
p5112
aVUpon our honors
p5113
aVO my good Lord Mowbray
p5114
aVConstrue the times to their necessities
p5115
aVAnd you shall say indeed it is the time
p5116
aVAnd not the King that doth you injuries
p5117
aVYet for your part it not appears to me
p5118
aVEither from the King or in the present time
p5119
aVThat you should have an inch of any ground
p5120
aVTo build a grief on Were you not restored
p5121
aVTo all the Duke of Norfolk\u2019s seigniories
p5122
aVYour noble and right well remembered father\u2019s
p5123
aVWhat thing in honor had my father lost
p5124
aVThat need to be revived and breathed in me
p5125
aVThe King that loved him as the state stood then
p5126
aVWas force perforce compelled to banish him
p5127
aVAnd then that Henry Bolingbroke and he
p5128
aVBeing mounted and both rousèd in their seats
p5129
aVTheir neighing coursers daring of the spur
p5130
aVTheir armèd staves in charge their beavers down
p5131
aVTheir eyes of fire sparkling through sights of steel
p5132
aVAnd the loud trumpet blowing them together
p5133
aVThen then when there was nothing could have stayed
p5134
aVMy father from the breast of Bolingbroke
p5135
aVO when the King did throw his warder down
p5136
aVHis own life hung upon the staff he threw
p5137
aVThen threw he down himself and all their lives
p5138
aVThat by indictment and by dint of sword
p5139
aVHave since miscarried under Bolingbroke
p5140
aVYou speak Lord Mowbray now you know not what
p5141
aVThe Earl of Hereford was reputed then
p5142
aVIn England the most valiant gentleman
p5143
aVWho knows on whom fortune would then have smiled
p5144
aVBut if your father had been victor there
p5145
aVHe ne\u2019er had borne it out of Coventry
p5146
aVFor all the country in a general voice
p5147
aVCried hate upon him and all their prayers and love
p5148
aVWere set on Hereford whom they doted on
p5149
aVAnd blessed and graced indeed more than the King
p5150
aVBut this is mere digression from my purpose
p5151
aVHere come I from our princely general
p5152
aVTo know your griefs to tell you from his Grace
p5153
aVThat he will give you audience and wherein
p5154
aVIt shall appear that your demands are just
p5155
aVYou shall enjoy them everything set off
p5156
aVThat might so much as think you enemies
p5157
aVBut he hath forced us to compel this offer
p5158
aVAnd it proceeds from policy not love
p5159
aVMowbray you overween to take it so
p5160
aVThis offer comes from mercy not from fear
p5161
aVFor lo within a ken our army lies
p5162
aVUpon mine honor all too confident
p5163
aVTo give admittance to a thought of fear
p5164
aVOur battle is more full of names than yours
p5165
aVOur men more perfect in the use of arms
p5166
aVOur armor all as strong our cause the best
p5167
aVThen reason will our hearts should be as good
p5168
aVSay you not then our offer is compelled
p5169
aVWell by my will we shall admit no parley
p5170
aVThat argues but the shame of your offense
p5171
aVA rotten case abides no handling
p5172
aVHath the Prince John a full commission
p5173
aVIn very ample virtue of his father
p5174
aVTo hear and absolutely to determine
p5175
aVOf what conditions we shall stand upon
p5176
aVThat is intended in the General\u2019s name
p5177
aVI muse you make so slight a question
p5178
aVThen take my Lord of Westmoreland this schedule
p5179
aVFor this contains our general grievances
p5180
aVEach several article herein redressed
p5181
aVAll members of our cause both here and hence
p5182
aVThat are insinewed to this action
p5183
aVAcquitted by a true substantial form
p5184
aVAnd present execution of our wills
p5185
aVTo us and to our purposes confined
p5186
aVWe come within our awful banks again
p5187
aVAnd knit our powers to the arm of peace
p5188
aVThis will I show the General Please you lords
p5189
aVIn sight of both our battles we may meet
p5190
aVAnd either end in peace which God so frame
p5191
aVOr to the place of difference call the swords
p5192
aVWhich must decide it
p5193
aVMy lord we will do so
p5194
aVThere is a thing within my bosom tells me
p5195
aVThat no conditions of our peace can stand
p5196
aVFear you not that If we can make our peace
p5197
aVUpon such large terms and so absolute
p5198
aVAs our conditions shall consist upon
p5199
aVOur peace shall stand as firm as rocky mountains
p5200
aVYea but our valuation shall be such
p5201
aVThat every slight and false-derivèd cause
p5202
aVYea every idle nice and wanton reason
p5203
aVShall to the King taste of this action
p5204
aVThat were our royal faiths martyrs in love
p5205
aVWe shall be winnowed with so rough a wind
p5206
aVThat even our corn shall seem as light as chaff
p5207
aVAnd good from bad find no partition
p5208
aVNo no my lord Note this the King is weary
p5209
aVOf dainty and such picking grievances
p5210
aVFor he hath found to end one doubt by death
p5211
aVRevives two greater in the heirs of life
p5212
aVAnd therefore will he wipe his tables clean
p5213
aVAnd keep no telltale to his memory
p5214
aVThat may repeat and history his loss
p5215
aVTo new remembrance For full well he knows
p5216
aVHe cannot so precisely weed this land
p5217
aVAs his misdoubts present occasion
p5218
aVHis foes are so enrooted with his friends
p5219
aVThat plucking to unfix an enemy
p5220
aVHe doth unfasten so and shake a friend
p5221
aVSo that this land like an offensive wife
p5222
aVThat hath enraged him on to offer strokes
p5223
aVAs he is striking holds his infant up
p5224
aVAnd hangs resolved correction in the arm
p5225
aVThat was upreared to execution
p5226
aVBesides the King hath wasted all his rods
p5227
aVOn late offenders that he now doth lack
p5228
aVThe very instruments of chastisement
p5229
aVSo that his power like to a fangless lion
p5230
aVMay offer but not hold
p5231
aV\u2019Tis very true
p5232
aVAnd therefore be assured my good Lord Marshal
p5233
aVIf we do now make our atonement well
p5234
aVOur peace will like a broken limb united
p5235
aVGrow stronger for the breaking
p5236
aVBe it so
p5237
aVHere is returned my Lord of Westmoreland
p5238
aVThe Prince is here at hand Pleaseth your Lordship
p5239
aVTo meet his Grace just distance \u2019tween our armies
p5240
aVYour Grace of York in God\u2019s name then set forward
p5241
aVBefore and greet his Grace My lord we come
p5242
aVYou are well encountered here my cousin Mowbray
p5243
aVGood day to you gentle Lord Archbishop
p5244
aVAnd so to you Lord Hastings and to all
p5245
aVMy Lord of York it better showed with you
p5246
aVWhen that your flock assembled by the bell
p5247
aVEncircled you to hear with reverence
p5248
aVYour exposition on the holy text
p5249
aVThan now to see you here an iron man talking
p5250
aVCheering a rout of rebels with your drum
p5251
aVTurning the word to sword and life to death
p5252
aVThat man that sits within a monarch\u2019s heart
p5253
aVAnd ripens in the sunshine of his favor
p5254
aVWould he abuse the countenance of the King
p5255
aVAlack what mischiefs might he set abroach
p5256
aVIn shadow of such greatness With you Lord Bishop
p5257
aVIt is even so Who hath not heard it spoken
p5258
aVHow deep you were within the books of God
p5259
aVTo us the speaker in His parliament
p5260
aVTo us th\u2019 imagined voice of God Himself
p5261
aVThe very opener and intelligencer
p5262
aVBetween the grace the sanctities of heaven
p5263
aVAnd our dull workings O who shall believe
p5264
aVBut you misuse the reverence of your place
p5265
aVEmploy the countenance and grace of heaven
p5266
aVAs a false favorite doth his prince\u2019s name
p5267
aVIn deeds dishonorable You have ta\u2019en up
p5268
aVUnder the counterfeited zeal of God
p5269
aVThe subjects of His substitute my father
p5270
aVAnd both against the peace of heaven and him
p5271
aVHave here up-swarmed them
p5272
aVGood my Lord of Lancaster
p5273
aVI am not here against your father\u2019s peace
p5274
aVBut as I told my Lord of Westmoreland
p5275
aVThe time misordered doth in common sense
p5276
aVCrowd us and crush us to this monstrous form
p5277
aVTo hold our safety up I sent your Grace
p5278
aVThe parcels and particulars of our grief
p5279
aVThe which hath been with scorn shoved from the court
p5280
aVWhereon this Hydra son of war is born
p5281
aVWhose dangerous eyes may well be charmed asleep
p5282
aVWith grant of our most just and right desires
p5283
aVAnd true obedience of this madness cured
p5284
aVStoop tamely to the foot of majesty
p5285
aVIf not we ready are to try our fortunes
p5286
aVTo the last man
p5287
aVAnd though we here fall down
p5288
aVWe have supplies to second our attempt
p5289
aVIf they miscarry theirs shall second them
p5290
aVAnd so success of mischief shall be born
p5291
aVAnd heir from heir shall hold his quarrel up
p5292
aVWhiles England shall have generation
p5293
aVYou are too shallow Hastings much too shallow
p5294
aVTo sound the bottom of the after-times
p5295
aVPleaseth your Grace to answer them directly
p5296
aVHow far forth you do like their articles
p5297
aVI like them all and do allow them well
p5298
aVAnd swear here by the honor of my blood
p5299
aVMy father\u2019s purposes have been mistook
p5300
aVAnd some about him have too lavishly
p5301
aVWrested his meaning and authority
p5302
aVTo the Archbishop My lord these griefs shall be with speed redressed
p5303
aVUpon my soul they shall If this may please you
p5304
aVDischarge your powers unto their several counties
p5305
aVAs we will ours and here between the armies
p5306
aVLet\u2019s drink together friendly and embrace
p5307
aVThat all their eyes may bear those tokens home
p5308
aVOf our restorèd love and amity
p5309
aVI take your princely word for these redresses
p5310
aVI give it you and will maintain my word
p5311
aVAnd thereupon I drink unto your Grace
p5312
aVGo captain and deliver to the army
p5313
aVThis news of peace Let them have pay and part
p5314
aVI know it will well please them Hie thee captain
p5315
aVTo you my noble Lord of Westmoreland
p5316
aVI pledge your Grace and if you knew what pains
p5317
aVI have bestowed to breed this present peace
p5318
aVYou would drink freely But my love to you
p5319
aVShall show itself more openly hereafter
p5320
aVI do not doubt you
p5321
aVI am glad of it
p5322
aVHealth to my lord and gentle cousin Mowbray
p5323
aVYou wish me health in very happy season
p5324
aVFor I am on the sudden something ill
p5325
aVAgainst ill chances men are ever merry
p5326
aVBut heaviness foreruns the good event
p5327
aVTherefore be merry coz since sudden sorrow
p5328
aVServes to say thus Some good thing comes tomorrow
p5329
aVBelieve me I am passing light in spirit
p5330
aVSo much the worse if your own rule be true
p5331
aVThe word of peace is rendered Hark how they shout
p5332
aVThis had been cheerful after victory
p5333
aVA peace is of the nature of a conquest
p5334
aVFor then both parties nobly are subdued
p5335
aVAnd neither party loser
p5336
aVGo my lord
p5337
aVAnd let our army be dischargèd too
p5338
aVTo the Archbishop And good my lord so please you let our trains
p5339
aVMarch by us that we may peruse the men
p5340
aVWe should have coped withal
p5341
aVGo good Lord Hastings
p5342
aVAnd ere they be dismissed let them march by
p5343
aVI trust lords we shall lie tonight together
p5344
aVNow cousin wherefore stands our army still
p5345
aVThe leaders having charge from you to stand
p5346
aVWill not go off until they hear you speak
p5347
aVThey know their duties
p5348
aVMy lord our army is dispersed already
p5349
aVLike youthful steers unyoked they take their courses
p5350
aVEast west north south or like a school broke up
p5351
aVEach hurries toward his home and sporting-place
p5352
aVGood tidings my Lord Hastings for the which
p5353
aVI do arrest thee traitor of high treason
p5354
aVAnd you Lord Archbishop and you Lord Mowbray
p5355
aVOf capital treason I attach you both
p5356
aVIs this proceeding just and honorable
p5357
aVIs your assembly so
p5358
aVWill you thus break your faith
p5359
aVI pawned thee none
p5360
aVI promised you redress of these same grievances
p5361
aVWhereof you did complain which by mine honor
p5362
aVI will perform with a most Christian care
p5363
aVBut for you rebels look to taste the due
p5364
aVMeet for rebellion and such acts as yours
p5365
aVMost shallowly did you these arms commence
p5366
aVFondly brought here and foolishly sent hence
p5367
aVStrike up our drums pursue the scattered stray
p5368
aVGod and not we hath safely fought today
p5369
aVSome guard these traitors to the block of death
p5370
aVTreason\u2019s true bed and yielder-up of breath
p5371
aVThe heat is past Follow no further now
p5372
aVCall in the powers good cousin Westmoreland
p5373
aVNow Falstaff where have you been all this while
p5374
aVWhen everything is ended then you come
p5375
aVThese tardy tricks of yours will on my life
p5376
aVOne time or other break some gallows\u2019 back
p5377
aVI am my lord but as my betters are
p5378
aVThat led me hither Had they been ruled by me
p5379
aVYou should have won them dearer than you have
p5380
aVNow have you left pursuit
p5381
aVRetreat is made and execution stayed

aVSend Colevile with his confederates
p5383
aVTo York to present execution

aVWe will our youth lead on to higher fields
p5395
aVAnd draw no swords but what are sanctified
p5396
aVOur navy is addressed our power collected
p5397
aVOur substitutes in absence well invested
p5398
aVAnd everything lies level to our wish
p5399
aVOnly we want a little personal strength
p5400
aVAnd pause us till these rebels now afoot
p5401
aVCome underneath the yoke of government
p5402
aVBoth which we doubt not but your Majesty
p5403
aVShall soon enjoy
p5404
aVHumphrey my son of Gloucester where is the Prince your brother
p5405
aVI think he\u2019s gone to hunt my lord at Windsor
p5406
aVAnd how accompanied

aVI do not know my lord

aVIs not his brother Thomas of Clarence with him
p5409
aVNo my good lord he is in presence here

aVNothing but well to thee Thomas of Clarence
p5411
aVHow chance thou art not with the Prince thy brother

aVThan all thy brothers Cherish it my boy
p5415
aVAnd noble offices thou mayst effect
p5416
aVOf mediation after I am dead
p5417
aVBetween his greatness and thy other brethren
p5418
aVTherefore omit him not blunt not his love
p5419
aVNor lose the good advantage of his grace
p5420
aVBy seeming cold or careless of his will
p5421
aVFor he is gracious if he be observed
p5422
aVHe hath a tear for pity and a hand
p5423
aVOpen as day for melting charity
p5424
aVYet notwithstanding being incensed he is flint
p5425
aVAs humorous as winter and as sudden
p5426
aVAs flaws congealèd in the spring of day
p5427
aVHis temper therefore must be well observed
p5428
aVChide him for faults and do it reverently
p5429
aVWhen you perceive his blood inclined to mirth
p5430
aVBut being moody give him time and scope
p5431
aVTill that his passions like a whale on ground

aVAnd thou shalt prove a shelter to thy friends
p5434
aVA hoop of gold to bind thy brothers in
p5435
aVThat the united vessel of their blood
p5436
aVMingled with venom of suggestion
p5437
aVAs force perforce the age will pour it in
p5438
aVShall never leak though it do work as strong
p5439
aVAs aconitum or rash gunpowder
p5440
aVI shall observe him with all care and love
p5441
aVWhy art thou not at Windsor with him Thomas
p5442
aVHe is not there today he dines in London
p5443
aVAnd how accompanied Canst thou tell that
p5444
aVWith Poins and other his continual followers
p5445
aVMost subject is the fattest soil to weeds
p5446
aVAnd he the noble image of my youth
p5447
aVIs overspread with them therefore my grief
p5448
aVStretches itself beyond the hour of death
p5449
aVThe blood weeps from my heart when I do shape

aVIn forms imaginary th\u2019 unguided days
p5451
aVAnd rotten times that you shall look upon

aVWhen I am sleeping with my ancestors

aVWhen rage and hot blood are his counsellors
p5455
aVWhen means and lavish manners meet together
p5456
aVO with what wings shall his affections fly
p5457
aVTowards fronting peril and opposed decay
p5458
aVMy gracious lord you look beyond him quite
p5459
aVThe Prince but studies his companions
p5460
aVLike a strange tongue wherein to gain the language
p5461
aV\u2019Tis needful that the most immodest word
p5462
aVBe looked upon and learned which once attained
p5463
aVYour Highness knows comes to no further use
p5464
aVBut to be known and hated So like gross terms
p5465
aVThe Prince will in the perfectness of time
p5466
aVCast off his followers and their memory
p5467
aVShall as a pattern or a measure live
p5468
aVBy which his Grace must mete the lives of others

aVBut write her fair words still in foulest letters
p5498
aVShe either gives a stomach and no food
p5499
aVSuch are the poor in health or else a feast

aVSo thin that life looks through and will break out
p5515
aVThe people fear me for they do observe
p5516
aVUnfathered heirs and loathly births of nature

aVThe seasons change their manners as the year

aVAs he whose brow with homely biggen bound

aVSnores out the watch of night O majesty
p5554
aVWhen thou dost pinch thy bearer thou dost sit
p5555
aVLike a rich armor worn in heat of day
p5556
aVThat scald\u2019st with safety By his gates of breath
p5557
aVThere lies a downy feather which stirs not
p5558
aVDid he suspire that light and weightless down
p5559
aVPerforce must move My gracious lord my father
p5560
aVThis sleep is sound indeed This is a sleep
p5561
aVThat from this golden rigol hath divorced
p5562
aVSo many English kings Thy due from me
p5563
aVIs tears and heavy sorrows of the blood
p5564
aVWhich nature love and filial tenderness
p5565
aVShall O dear father pay thee plenteously
p5566
aVMy due from thee is this imperial crown

aVDoth the King call
p5574
aVWhat would your Majesty How fares your Grace
p5575
aVWhy did you leave me here alone my lords

aVThis door is open He is gone this way
p5581
aVHe came not through the chamber where we stayed
p5582
aVWhere is the crown Who took it from my pillow
p5583
aVWhen we withdrew my liege we left it here
p5584
aVThe Prince hath ta\u2019en it hence Go seek him out
p5585
aVIs he so hasty that he doth suppose my sleep my death
p5586
aVFind him my Lord of Warwick Chide him hither
p5587
aVThis part of his conjoins with my disease
p5588
aVAnd helps to end me See sons what things you are
p5589
aVHow quickly nature falls into revolt
p5590
aVWhen gold becomes her object
p5591
aVFor this the foolish overcareful fathers
p5592
aVHave broke their sleep with thoughts
p5593
aVTheir brains with care their bones with industry
p5594
aVFor this they have engrossèd and piled up
p5595
aVThe cankered heaps of strange-achievèd gold
p5596
aVFor this they have been thoughtful to invest
p5597
aVTheir sons with arts and martial exercises
p5598
aVWhen like the bee tolling from every flower
p5599
aVThe virtuous sweets
p5600
aVOur thighs packed with wax our mouths with honey
p5601
aVWe bring it to the hive and like the bees
p5602
aVAre murdered for our pains This bitter taste
p5603
aVYields his engrossments to the ending father
p5604
aVNow where is he that will not stay so long
p5605
aVTill his friend sickness hath determined me
p5606
aVMy lord I found the Prince in the next room
p5607
aVWashing with kindly tears his gentle cheeks
p5608
aVWith such a deep demeanor in great sorrow
p5609
aVThat tyranny which never quaffed but blood
p5610
aVWould by beholding him have washed his knife
p5611
aVWith gentle eyedrops He is coming hither
p5612
aVBut wherefore did he take away the crown
p5613
aVLo where he comes Come hither to me Harry
p5614
aVDepart the chamber Leave us here alone
p5615
aVI never thought to hear you speak again
p5616
aVThy wish was father Harry to that thought
p5617
aVI stay too long by thee I weary thee
p5618
aVDost thou so hunger for mine empty chair
p5619
aVThat thou wilt needs invest thee with my honors
p5620
aVBefore thy hour be ripe O foolish youth
p5621
aVThou seek\u2019st the greatness that will overwhelm thee
p5622
aVStay but a little for my cloud of dignity
p5623
aVIs held from falling with so weak a wind
p5624
aVThat it will quickly drop My day is dim
p5625
aVThou hast stol\u2019n that which after some few hours
p5626
aVWere thine without offense and at my death
p5627
aVThou hast sealed up my expectation
p5628
aVThy life did manifest thou loved\u2019st me not
p5629
aVAnd thou wilt have me die assured of it
p5630
aVThou hid\u2019st a thousand daggers in thy thoughts
p5631
aVWhom thou hast whetted on thy stony heart
p5632
aVTo stab at half an hour of my life
p5633
aVWhat canst thou not forbear me half an hour
p5634
aVThen get thee gone and dig my grave thyself
p5635
aVAnd bid the merry bells ring to thine ear
p5636
aVThat thou art crownèd not that I am dead
p5637
aVLet all the tears that should bedew my hearse
p5638
aVBe drops of balm to sanctify thy head
p5639
aVOnly compound me with forgotten dust
p5640
aVGive that which gave thee life unto the worms
p5641
aVPluck down my officers break my decrees
p5642
aVFor now a time is come to mock at form
p5643
aVHarry the Fifth is crowned Up vanity
p5644
aVDown royal state all you sage councillors hence
p5645
aVAnd to the English court assemble now
p5646
aVFrom every region apes of idleness
p5647
aVNow neighbor confines purge you of your scum
p5648
aVHave you a ruffian that will swear drink dance
p5649
aVRevel the night rob murder and commit
p5650
aVThe oldest sins the newest kind of ways
p5651
aVBe happy he will trouble you no more
p5652
aVEngland shall double gild his treble guilt
p5653
aVEngland shall give him office honor might
p5654
aVFor the fifth Harry from curbed license plucks
p5655
aVThe muzzle of restraint and the wild dog
p5656
aVShall flesh his tooth on every innocent
p5657
aVO my poor kingdom sick with civil blows
p5658
aVWhen that my care could not withhold thy riots
p5659
aVWhat wilt thou do when riot is thy care
p5660
aVO thou wilt be a wilderness again
p5661
aVPeopled with wolves thy old inhabitants
p5662
aVO pardon me my liege But for my tears
p5663
aVThe moist impediments unto my speech
p5664
aVI had forestalled this dear and deep rebuke
p5665
aVEre you with grief had spoke and I had heard
p5666
aVThe course of it so far There is your crown
p5667
aVAnd He that wears the crown immortally
p5668
aVLong guard it yours He kneels If I affect it more
p5669
aVThan as your honor and as your renown
p5670
aVLet me no more from this obedience rise
p5671
aVWhich my most inward true and duteous spirit
p5672
aVTeacheth this prostrate and exterior bending
p5673
aVGod witness with me when I here came in
p5674
aVAnd found no course of breath within your Majesty
p5675
aVHow cold it struck my heart If I do feign
p5676
aVO let me in my present wildness die
p5677
aVAnd never live to show th\u2019 incredulous world
p5678
aVThe noble change that I have purposèd
p5679
aVComing to look on you thinking you dead
p5680
aVAnd dead almost my liege to think you were
p5681
aVI spake unto this crown as having sense
p5682
aVAnd thus upbraided it The care on thee depending
p5683
aVHath fed upon the body of my father
p5684
aVTherefore thou best of gold art worst of gold
p5685
aVOther less fine in carat is more precious
p5686
aVPreserving life in med\u2019cine potable
p5687
aVBut thou most fine most honored most renowned
p5688
aVHast eat thy bearer up Thus my most royal liege
p5689
aVAccusing it I put it on my head
p5690
aVTo try with it as with an enemy
p5691
aVThat had before my face murdered my father
p5692
aVThe quarrel of a true inheritor
p5693
aVBut if it did infect my blood with joy
p5694
aVOr swell my thoughts to any strain of pride
p5695
aVIf any rebel or vain spirit of mine
p5696
aVDid with the least affection of a welcome
p5697
aVGive entertainment to the might of it
p5698
aVLet God forever keep it from my head
p5699
aVAnd make me as the poorest vassal is
p5700
aVThat doth with awe and terror kneel to it
p5701
aVO my son
p5702
aVGod put it in thy mind to take it hence
p5703
aVThat thou mightst win the more thy father\u2019s love
p5704
aVPleading so wisely in excuse of it
p5705
aVCome hither Harry sit thou by my bed
p5706
aVAnd hear I think the very latest counsel
p5707
aVThat ever I shall breathe
p5708
aVGod knows my son
p5709
aVBy what bypaths and indirect crook\u2019d ways
p5710
aVI met this crown and I myself know well
p5711
aVHow troublesome it sat upon my head
p5712
aVTo thee it shall descend with better quiet
p5713
aVBetter opinion better confirmation
p5714
aVFor all the soil of the achievement goes
p5715
aVWith me into the earth It seemed in me
p5716
aVBut as an honor snatched with boist\u2019rous hand
p5717
aVAnd I had many living to upbraid
p5718
aVMy gain of it by their assistances
p5719
aVWhich daily grew to quarrel and to bloodshed
p5720
aVWounding supposèd peace All these bold fears
p5721
aVThou seest with peril I have answerèd
p5722
aVFor all my reign hath been but as a scene
p5723
aVActing that argument And now my death
p5724
aVChanges the mood for what in me was purchased
p5725
aVFalls upon thee in a more fairer sort
p5726
aVSo thou the garland wear\u2019st successively
p5727
aVYet though thou stand\u2019st more sure than I could do
p5728
aVThou art not firm enough since griefs are green
p5729
aVAnd all my friends which thou must make thy friends
p5730
aVHave but their stings and teeth newly ta\u2019en out
p5731
aVBy whose fell working I was first advanced
p5732
aVAnd by whose power I well might lodge a fear
p5733
aVTo be again displaced which to avoid
p5734
aVI cut them off and had a purpose now
p5735
aVTo lead out many to the Holy Land
p5736
aVLest rest and lying still might make them look
p5737
aVToo near unto my state Therefore my Harry
p5738
aVBe it thy course to busy giddy minds
p5739
aVWith foreign quarrels that action hence borne out
p5740
aVMay waste the memory of the former days
p5741
aVMore would I but my lungs are wasted so
p5742
aVThat strength of speech is utterly denied me
p5743
aVHow I came by the crown O God forgive
p5744
aVAnd grant it may with thee in true peace live
p5745
aVMy gracious liege
p5746
aVYou won it wore it kept it gave it me
p5747
aVThen plain and right must my possession be
p5748
aVWhich I with more than with a common pain
p5749
aV\u2019Gainst all the world will rightfully maintain
p5750
aVLook look here comes my John of Lancaster
p5751
aVHealth peace and happiness to my royal father
p5752
aVThou bring\u2019st me happiness and peace son John
p5753
aVBut health alack with youthful wings is flown
p5754
aVFrom this bare withered trunk Upon thy sight
p5755
aVMy worldly business makes a period
p5756
aVWhere is my Lord of Warwick
p5757
aVMy Lord of Warwick
p5758
aVDoth any name particular belong
p5759
aVUnto the lodging where I first did swoon
p5760
aV\u2019Tis called Jerusalem my noble lord
p5761
aVLaud be to God Even there my life must end
p5762
aVIt hath been prophesied to me many years
p5763
aVI should not die but in Jerusalem
p5764
aVWhich vainly I supposed the Holy Land
p5765
aVBut bear me to that chamber there I\u2019ll lie
p5766
aVIn that Jerusalem shall Harry die
p5767
aVHow now my Lord Chief Justice whither away
p5768
aVHow doth the King
p5769
aVExceeding well His cares are now all ended
p5770
aVI hope not dead
p5771
aVHe\u2019s walked the way of nature
p5772
aVAnd to our purposes he lives no more
p5773
aVI would his Majesty had called me with him
p5774
aVThe service that I truly did his life
p5775
aVHath left me open to all injuries
p5776
aVIndeed I think the young king loves you not
p5777
aVI know he doth not and do arm myself
p5778
aVTo welcome the condition of the time
p5779
aVWhich cannot look more hideously upon me
p5780
aVThan I have drawn it in my fantasy
p5781
aVHere come the heavy issue of dead Harry
p5782
aVO that the living Harry had the temper
p5783
aVOf he the worst of these three gentlemen
p5784
aVHow many nobles then should hold their places
p5785
aVThat must strike sail to spirits of vile sort
p5786
aVO God I fear all will be overturned
p5787
aVGood morrow cousin Warwick good morrow
p5788
aVGood morrow cousin
p5789
aVWe meet like men that had forgot to speak
p5790
aVWe do remember but our argument
p5791
aVIs all too heavy to admit much talk
p5792
aVWell peace be with him that hath made us heavy
p5793
aVPeace be with us lest we be heavier
p5794
aVO good my lord you have lost a friend indeed
p5795
aVAnd I dare swear you borrow not that face
p5796
aVOf seeming sorrow it is sure your own
p5797
aVThough no man be assured what grace to find
p5798
aVYou stand in coldest expectation
p5799
aVI am the sorrier would \u2019twere otherwise
p5800
aVWell you must now speak Sir John Falstaff fair
p5801
aVWhich swims against your stream of quality
p5802
aVSweet princes what I did I did in honor
p5803
aVLed by th\u2019 impartial conduct of my soul
p5804
aVAnd never shall you see that I will beg
p5805
aVA ragged and forestalled remission
p5806
aVIf truth and upright innocency fail me
p5807
aVI\u2019ll to the king my master that is dead
p5808
aVAnd tell him who hath sent me after him
p5809

aVAnd in th\u2019 administration of his law
p5842
aVWhiles I was busy for the commonwealth
p5843
aVYour Highness pleasèd to forget my place
p5844
aVThe majesty and power of law and justice
p5845
aVThe image of the King whom I presented
p5846
aVAnd struck me in my very seat of judgment
p5847
aVWhereon as an offender to your father
p5848
aVI gave bold way to my authority
p5849
aVAnd did commit you If the deed were ill
p5850
aVBe you contented wearing now the garland
p5851
aVTo have a son set your decrees at nought
p5852
aVTo pluck down justice from your awful bench

aVAnd I do wish your honors may increase
p5871
aVTill you do live to see a son of mine
p5872

aVThat dares do justice on my proper son
p5876
aVAnd not less happy having such a son
p5877
aVThat would deliver up his greatness so
p5878
aVInto the hands of justice You did commit me
p5879
aVFor which I do commit into your hand
p5880

p5890
aVFor in his tomb lie my affections

aVTo mock the expectation of the world
p5893
aVTo frustrate prophecies and to raze out

aVAnd heir apparent to the English crown
p6146
aVHad Henry got an empire by his marriage
p6147
aVAnd all the wealthy kingdoms of the West

aVBewitch your hearts be wise and circumspect
p6151
aVWhat though the common people favor him
p6152
aVCalling him Humphrey the good Duke of Gloucester

aVClapping their hands and crying with loud voice
p6154
aVJesu maintain your royal Excellence
p6155
aVWith God preserve the good Duke Humphrey
p6156
aVI fear me lords for all this flattering gloss
p6157
aVHe will be found a dangerous Protector

aVHe being of age to govern of himself
p6160
aVCousin of Somerset join you with me
p6161
aVAnd all together with the Duke of Suffolk

aVThis weighty business will not brook delay
p6164
aVI\u2019ll to the Duke of Suffolk presently
p6165
aVCousin of Buckingham though Humphrey\u2019s pride
p6166
aVAnd greatness of his place be grief to us
p6167
aVYet let us watch the haughty cardinal
p6168
aVHis insolence is more intolerable
p6169
aVThan all the princes\u2019 in the land besides
p6170
aVIf Gloucester be displaced he\u2019ll be Protector
p6171
aVOr thou or I Somerset will be Protector
p6172
aVDespite Duke Humphrey or the Cardinal
p6173
aVPride went before Ambition follows him
p6174
aVWhile these do labor for their own preferment
p6175
aVBehooves it us to labor for the realm
p6176
aVI never saw but Humphrey Duke of Gloucester
p6177
aVDid bear him like a noble gentleman
p6178
aVOft have I seen the haughty cardinal
p6179
aVMore like a soldier than a man o\u2019 th\u2019 Church
p6180
aVAs stout and proud as he were lord of all
p6181
aVSwear like a ruffian and demean himself
p6182
aVUnlike the ruler of a commonweal

aVWarwick my son the comfort of my age

aVThy deeds thy plainness and thy housekeeping

aVAnd brother York thy acts in Ireland
p6188
aVIn bringing them to civil discipline
p6189
aVThy late exploits done in the heart of France
p6190
aVWhen thou wert regent for our sovereign
p6191
aVHave made thee feared and honored of the people
p6192
aVJoin we together for the public good
p6193
aVIn what we can to bridle and suppress
p6194
aVThe pride of Suffolk and the Cardinal
p6195
aVWith Somerset\u2019s and Buckingham\u2019s ambition
p6196
aVAnd as we may cherish Duke Humphrey\u2019s deeds
p6197
aVWhile they do tend the profit of the land
p6198
aVSo God help Warwick as he loves the land
p6199
aVAnd common profit of his country
p6200
aVAnd so says York aside for he hath greatest cause
p6201
aVThen let\u2019s make haste away and look unto the main
p6202
aVUnto the main O father Maine is lost
p6203
aVThat Maine which by main force Warwick did win
p6204

aVWhich I will win from France or else be slain
p6207
aVAnjou and Maine are given to the French
p6208
aVParis is lost the state of Normandy

aVStands on a tickle point now they are gone
p6210
aVSuffolk concluded on the articles
p6211
aVThe peers agreed and Henry was well pleased
p6212
aVTo change two dukedoms for a duke\u2019s fair daughter
p6213
aVI cannot blame them all What is \u2019t to them
p6214
aV\u2019Tis thine they give away and not their own
p6215
aVPirates may make cheap pennyworths of their pillage
p6216
aVAnd purchase friends and give to courtesans
p6217
aVStill reveling like lords till all be gone
p6218
aVWhileas the silly owner of the goods
p6219
aVWeeps over them and wrings his hapless hands
p6220
aVAnd shakes his head and trembling stands aloof
p6221
aVWhile all is shared and all is borne away
p6222
aVReady to starve and dare not touch his own
p6223
aVSo York must sit and fret and bite his tongue
p6224
aVWhile his own lands are bargained for and sold
p6225
aVMethinks the realms of England France and Ireland
p6226
aVBear that proportion to my flesh and blood
p6227
aVAs did the fatal brand Althaea burnt
p6228
aVUnto the Prince\u2019s heart of Calydon
p6229
aVAnjou and Maine both given unto the French
p6230
aVCold news for me for I had hope of France
p6231
aVEven as I have of fertile England\u2019s soil
p6232
aVA day will come when York shall claim his own
p6233
aVAnd therefore I will take the Nevilles\u2019 parts
p6234
aVAnd make a show of love to proud Duke Humphrey
p6235
aVAnd when I spy advantage claim the crown
p6236
aVFor that\u2019s the golden mark I seek to hit
p6237
aVNor shall proud Lancaster usurp my right
p6238
aVNor hold the scepter in his childish fist
p6239
aVNor wear the diadem upon his head
p6240
aVWhose churchlike humors fits not for a crown
p6241
aVThen York be still awhile till time do serve
p6242
aVWatch thou and wake when others be asleep
p6243
aVTo pry into the secrets of the state
p6244
aVTill Henry surfeiting in joys of love
p6245
aVWith his new bride and England\u2019s dear-bought queen
p6246
aVAnd Humphrey with the peers be fall\u2019n at jars
p6247
aVThen will I raise aloft the milk-white rose
p6248
aVWith whose sweet smell the air shall be perfumed
p6249
aVAnd in my standard bear the arms of York
p6250
aVTo grapple with the house of Lancaster
p6251
aVAnd force perforce I\u2019ll make him yield the crown
p6252
aVWhose bookish rule hath pulled fair England down
p6253
aVWhy droops my lord like over-ripened corn
p6254
aVHanging the head at Ceres\u2019 plenteous load
p6255
aVWhy doth the great Duke Humphrey knit his brows
p6256
aVAs frowning at the favors of the world
p6257
aVWhy are thine eyes fixed to the sullen earth
p6258
aVGazing on that which seems to dim thy sight
p6259
aVWhat seest thou there King Henry\u2019s diadem
p6260
aVEnchased with all the honors of the world
p6261
aVIf so gaze on and grovel on thy face
p6262
aVUntil thy head be circled with the same
p6263
aVPut forth thy hand reach at the glorious gold
p6264
aVWhat is \u2019t too short I\u2019ll lengthen it with mine
p6265
aVAnd having both together heaved it up
p6266
aVWe\u2019ll both together lift our heads to heaven
p6267
aVAnd never more abase our sight so low
p6268
aVAs to vouchsafe one glance unto the ground
p6269
aVO Nell sweet Nell if thou dost love thy lord
p6270
aVBanish the canker of ambitious thoughts
p6271
aVAnd may that hour when I imagine ill
p6272
aVAgainst my king and nephew virtuous Henry
p6273
aVBe my last breathing in this mortal world
p6274
aVMy troublous dreams this night doth make me sad
p6275
aVWhat dreamed my lord Tell me and I\u2019ll requite it
p6276
aVWith sweet rehearsal of my morning\u2019s dream
p6277
aVMethought this staff mine office badge in court
p6278
aVWas broke in twain by whom I have forgot
p6279
aVBut as I think it was by th\u2019 Cardinal
p6280
aVAnd on the pieces of the broken wand
p6281
aVWere placed the heads of Edmund Duke of Somerset
p6282
aVAnd William de la Pole first Duke of Suffolk
p6283
aVThis was my dream What it doth bode God knows
p6284
aVTut this was nothing but an argument
p6285
aVThat he that breaks a stick of Gloucester\u2019s grove
p6286
aVShall lose his head for his presumption
p6287
aVBut list to me my Humphrey my sweet duke
p6288
aVMethought I sat in seat of majesty
p6289
aVIn the cathedral church of Westminster
p6290
aVAnd in that chair where kings and queens were crowned
p6291
aVWhere Henry and Dame Margaret kneeled to me
p6292
aVAnd on my head did set the diadem
p6293
aVNay Eleanor then must I chide outright
p6294
aVPresumptuous dame ill-nurtured Eleanor

p6297
aVHast thou not worldly pleasure at command

aVAbove the reach or compass of thy thought
p6299
aVAnd wilt thou still be hammering treachery
p6300
aVTo tumble down thy husband and thyself
p6301
aVFrom top of honor to disgrace\u2019s feet
p6302
aVAway from me and let me hear no more
p6303
aVWhat what my lord Are you so choleric
p6304

aVFollow I must I cannot go before
p6314
aVWhile Gloucester bears this base and humble mind
p6315

p6317
aVAnd smooth my way upon their headless necks
p6318
aVAnd being a woman I will not be slack

p6327
aVWith Margery Jourdain the cunning witch

p6332
aVThat shall make answer to such questions
p6333
aVAs by your Grace shall be propounded him

aVThe business asketh silent secrecy
p6344
aVDame Eleanor gives gold to bring the witch
p6345
aVGold cannot come amiss were she a devil
p6346
aVYet have I gold flies from another coast
p6347
aVI dare not say from the rich cardinal
p6348
aVAnd from the great and new-made Duke of Suffolk
p6349
aVYet I do find it so For to be plain
p6350
aVThey knowing Dame Eleanor\u2019s aspiring humor
p6351
aVHave hirèd me to undermine the Duchess
p6352
aVAnd buzz these conjurations in her brain
p6353
aVThey say a crafty knave does need no broker
p6354
aVYet am I Suffolk and the Cardinal\u2019s broker
p6355
aVHume if you take not heed you shall go near
p6356
aVTo call them both a pair of crafty knaves
p6357
aVWell so it stands and thus I fear at last
p6358
aVHume\u2019s knavery will be the Duchess\u2019 wrack
p6359
aVAnd her attainture will be Humphrey\u2019s fall
p6360
aVSort how it will I shall have gold for all

aVAway base cullions Suffolk let them go
p6365
aVCome let\u2019s be gone
p6366
aVMy lord of Suffolk say is this the guise
p6367
aVIs this the fashions in the court of England
p6368
aVIs this the government of Britain\u2019s isle
p6369
aVAnd this the royalty of Albion\u2019s king
p6370
aVWhat shall King Henry be a pupil still
p6371
aVUnder the surly Gloucester\u2019s governance
p6372
aVAm I a queen in title and in style
p6373
aVAnd must be made a subject to a duke
p6374
aVI tell thee Pole when in the city Tours
p6375
aVThou rann\u2019st atilt in honor of my love
p6376
aVAnd stol\u2019st away the ladies\u2019 hearts of France
p6377
aVI thought King Henry had resembled thee
p6378
aVIn courage courtship and proportion
p6379
aVBut all his mind is bent to holiness
p6380
aVTo number Ave Marys on his beads
p6381
aVHis champions are the prophets and apostles
p6382
aVHis weapons holy saws of sacred writ
p6383
aVHis study is his tiltyard and his loves
p6384
aVAre brazen images of canonized saints
p6385
aVI would the College of the Cardinals
p6386
aVWould choose him pope and carry him to Rome
p6387
aVAnd set the triple crown upon his head
p6388
aVThat were a state fit for his holiness
p6389
aVMadam be patient As I was cause
p6390
aVYour Highness came to England so will I
p6391
aVIn England work your Grace\u2019s full content
p6392
aVBesides the haughty Protector have we Beaufort
p6393
aVThe imperious churchman Somerset Buckingham
p6394
aVAnd grumbling York and not the least of these
p6395
aVBut can do more in England than the King
p6396
aVAnd he of these that can do most of all
p6397
aVCannot do more in England than the Nevilles
p6398
aVSalisbury and Warwick are no simple peers
p6399
aVNot all these lords do vex me half so much
p6400
aVAs that proud dame the Lord Protector\u2019s wife
p6401
aVShe sweeps it through the court with troops of ladies
p6402
aVMore like an empress than Duke Humphrey\u2019s wife
p6403
aVStrangers in court do take her for the Queen
p6404
aVShe bears a duke\u2019s revenues on her back
p6405
aVAnd in her heart she scorns our poverty
p6406
aVShall I not live to be avenged on her
p6407
aVContemptuous baseborn callet as she is
p6408
aVShe vaunted \u2019mongst her minions t\u2019 other day
p6409
aVThe very train of her worst wearing gown
p6410
aVWas better worth than all my father\u2019s lands
p6411
aVTill Suffolk gave two dukedoms for his daughter
p6412
aVMadam myself have limed a bush for her
p6413
aVAnd placed a choir of such enticing birds
p6414
aVThat she will light to listen to the lays
p6415
aVAnd never mount to trouble you again
p6416
aVSo let her rest And madam list to me
p6417
aVFor I am bold to counsel you in this
p6418
aVAlthough we fancy not the Cardinal
p6419
aVYet must we join with him and with the lords
p6420
aVTill we have brought Duke Humphrey in disgrace
p6421
aVAs for the Duke of York this late complaint
p6422
aVWill make but little for his benefit
p6423
aVSo one by one we\u2019ll weed them all at last
p6424
aVAnd you yourself shall steer the happy helm
p6425
aVFor my part noble lords I care not which
p6426
aVOr Somerset or York all\u2019s one to me
p6427
aVIf York have ill demeaned himself in France
p6428
aVThen let him be denied the regentship
p6429
aVIf Somerset be unworthy of the place
p6430
aVLet York be regent I will yield to him
p6431
aVWhether your Grace be worthy yea or no
p6432
aVDispute not that York is the worthier
p6433
aVAmbitious Warwick let thy betters speak
p6434
aVThe Cardinal\u2019s not my better in the field
p6435
aVAll in this presence are thy betters Warwick
p6436
aVWarwick may live to be the best of all
p6437
aVPeace son And show some reason Buckingham
p6438
aVWhy Somerset should be preferred in this
p6439
aVBecause the King forsooth will have it so
p6440
aVMadam the King is old enough himself
p6441
aVTo give his censure These are no women\u2019s matters
p6442
aVIf he be old enough what needs your Grace
p6443
aVTo be Protector of his Excellence
p6444
aVMadam I am Protector of the realm
p6445
aVAnd at his pleasure will resign my place
p6446
aVResign it then and leave thine insolence
p6447
aVSince thou wert king as who is king but thou
p6448
aVThe commonwealth hath daily run to wrack
p6449
aVThe Dauphin hath prevailed beyond the seas
p6450
aVAnd all the peers and nobles of the realm
p6451
aVHave been as bondmen to thy sovereignty
p6452
aVThe Commons hast thou racked the clergy\u2019s bags
p6453
aVAre lank and lean with thy extortions
p6454
aVThy sumptuous buildings and thy wife\u2019s attire
p6455
aVHave cost a mass of public treasury
p6456
aVThy cruelty in execution
p6457
aVUpon offenders hath exceeded law
p6458
aVAnd left thee to the mercy of the law
p6459
aVThy sale of offices and towns in France
p6460
aVIf they were known as the suspect is great
p6461
aVWould make thee quickly hop without thy head
p6462
aVTo Duchess Give me my fan What minion can you not

p6467
aVSweet aunt be quiet \u2019Twas against her will
p6468
aVAgainst her will good king Look to \u2019t in time
p6469
aVShe\u2019ll hamper thee and dandle thee like a baby
p6470
aVThough in this place most master wear no breeches
p6471
aVShe shall not strike Dame Eleanor unrevenged
p6472
aVLord Cardinal I will follow Eleanor
p6473
aVAnd listen after Humphrey how he proceeds
p6474
aVShe\u2019s tickled now her fume needs no spurs
p6475
aVShe\u2019ll gallop far enough to her destruction
p6476
aVNow lords my choler being overblown
p6477
aVWith walking once about the quadrangle
p6478
aVI come to talk of commonwealth affairs
p6479
aVAs for your spiteful false objections
p6480
aVProve them and I lie open to the law
p6481
aVBut God in mercy so deal with my soul
p6482
aVAs I in duty love my king and country
p6483
aVBut to the matter that we have in hand
p6484
aVI say my sovereign York is meetest man
p6485
aVTo be your regent in the realm of France
p6486
aVBefore we make election give me leave
p6487
aVTo show some reason of no little force
p6488
aVThat York is most unmeet of any man
p6489
aVI\u2019ll tell thee Suffolk why I am unmeet
p6490
aVFirst for I cannot flatter thee in pride
p6491
aVNext if I be appointed for the place
p6492
aVMy lord of Somerset will keep me here
p6493
aVWithout discharge money or furniture
p6494
aVTill France be won into the Dauphin\u2019s hands
p6495
aVLast time I danced attendance on his will
p6496
aVTill Paris was besieged famished and lost
p6497
aVThat can I witness and a fouler fact
p6498
aVDid never traitor in the land commit
p6499
aVPeace headstrong Warwick
p6500
aVImage of pride why should I hold my peace
p6501
aVBecause here is a man accused of treason
p6502
aVPray God the Duke of York excuse himself
p6503
aVDoth anyone accuse York for a traitor
p6504
aVWhat mean\u2019st thou Suffolk Tell me what are these
p6505
aVPlease it your Majesty this is the man
p6506
aVThat doth accuse his master of high treason
p6507
aVHis words were these that Richard Duke of York
p6508
aVWas rightful heir unto the English crown
p6509
aVAnd that your Majesty was an usurper
p6510
aVSay man were these thy words
p6511
aVBase dunghill villain and mechanical
p6512
aVI\u2019ll have thy head for this thy traitor\u2019s speech
p6513
aVI do beseech your royal Majesty
p6514
aVLet him have all the rigor of the law
p6515

p6516
aVThis doom my lord if I may judge
p6517
aVLet Somerset be regent o\u2019er the French
p6518
aVBecause in York this breeds suspicion
p6519
aVAnd let these have a day appointed them
p6520
aVFor single combat in convenient place
p6521
aVFor he hath witness of his servant\u2019s malice
p6522
aVThis is the law and this Duke Humphrey\u2019s doom

aVSorry I am to hear what I have heard

aVNoble she is but if she have forgot
p6733
aVHonor and virtue and conversed with such
p6734
aVAs like to pitch defile nobility
p6735
aVI banish her my bed and company
p6736
aVAnd give her as a prey to law and shame
p6737
aVThat hath dishonored Gloucester\u2019s honest name
p6738
aVWell for this night we will repose us here
p6739
aVTomorrow toward London back again
p6740
aVTo look into this business thoroughly
p6741
aVAnd call these foul offenders to their answers
p6742
aVAnd poise the cause in Justice\u2019 equal scales
p6743
aVWhose beam stands sure whose rightful cause prevails
p6744
aVNow my good lords of Salisbury and Warwick
p6745
aVOur simple supper ended give me leave
p6746
aVIn this close walk to satisfy myself
p6747
aVIn craving your opinion of my title
p6748
aVWhich is infallible to England\u2019s crown
p6749
aVMy lord I long to hear it at full
p6750
aVSweet York begin and if thy claim be good
p6751
aVThe Nevilles are thy subjects to command
p6752
aVThen thus
p6753
aVEdward the Third my lords had seven sons
p6754
aVThe first Edward the Black Prince Prince of Wales
p6755
aVThe second William of Hatfield and the third
p6756
aVLionel Duke of Clarence next to whom
p6757
aVWas John of Gaunt the Duke of Lancaster
p6758
aVThe fifth was Edmund Langley Duke of York
p6759
aVThe sixth was Thomas of Woodstock Duke of Gloucester
p6760
aVWilliam of Windsor was the seventh and last
p6761
aVEdward the Black Prince died before his father
p6762
aVAnd left behind him Richard his only son
p6763
aVWho after Edward the Third\u2019s death reigned as king
p6764
aVTill Henry Bolingbroke Duke of Lancaster
p6765
aVThe eldest son and heir of John of Gaunt
p6766
aVCrowned by the name of Henry the Fourth
p6767
aVSeized on the realm deposed the rightful king
p6768
aVSent his poor queen to France from whence she came
p6769
aVAnd him to Pomfret where as all you know
p6770
aVHarmless Richard was murdered traitorously
p6771
aVFather the Duke hath told the truth
p6772
aVThus got the house of Lancaster the crown
p6773
aVWhich now they hold by force and not by right
p6774
aVFor Richard the first son\u2019s heir being dead
p6775
aVThe issue of the next son should have reigned
p6776
aVBut William of Hatfield died without an heir
p6777
aVThe third son Duke of Clarence from whose line
p6778
aVI claim the crown had issue Philippa a daughter
p6779
aVWho married Edmund Mortimer Earl of March
p6780
aVEdmund had issue Roger Earl of March
p6781
aVRoger had issue Edmund Anne and Eleanor
p6782
aVThis Edmund in the reign of Bolingbroke
p6783
aVAs I have read laid claim unto the crown
p6784
aVAnd but for Owen Glendower had been king
p6785
aVWho kept him in captivity till he died
p6786
aVBut to the rest
p6787
aVHis eldest sister Anne
p6788
aVMy mother being heir unto the crown
p6789
aVMarried Richard Earl of Cambridge who was son
p6790
aVTo Edmund Langley Edward the Third\u2019s fifth son
p6791
aVBy her I claim the kingdom She was heir
p6792
aVTo Roger Earl of March who was the son
p6793
aVOf Edmund Mortimer who married Philippa
p6794
aVSole daughter unto Lionel Duke of Clarence
p6795
aVSo if the issue of the elder son
p6796
aVSucceed before the younger I am king
p6797
aVWhat plain proceedings is more plain than this
p6798
aVHenry doth claim the crown from John of Gaunt
p6799
aVThe fourth son York claims it from the third
p6800
aVTill Lionel\u2019s issue fails his should not reign
p6801
aVIt fails not yet but flourishes in thee
p6802
aVAnd in thy sons fair slips of such a stock
p6803
aVThen father Salisbury kneel we together
p6804
aVAnd in this private plot be we the first
p6805
aVThat shall salute our rightful sovereign
p6806
aVWith honor of his birthright to the crown
p6807
aVLong live our sovereign Richard England\u2019s king
p6808
aVWe thank you lords They rise But I am not your king
p6809
aVTill I be crowned and that my sword be stained
p6810
aVWith heart-blood of the house of Lancaster
p6811
aVAnd that\u2019s not suddenly to be performed
p6812
aVBut with advice and silent secrecy
p6813
aVDo you as I do in these dangerous days
p6814
aVWink at the Duke of Suffolk\u2019s insolence
p6815
aVAt Beaufort\u2019s pride at Somerset\u2019s ambition
p6816
aVAt Buckingham and all the crew of them
p6817
aVTill they have snared the shepherd of the flock
p6818
aVThat virtuous prince the good Duke Humphrey
p6819
aV\u2019Tis that they seek and they in seeking that
p6820
aVShall find their deaths if York can prophesy
p6821
aVMy lord break we off We know your mind at full
p6822
aVMy heart assures me that the Earl of Warwick
p6823
aVShall one day make the Duke of York a king
p6824
aVAnd Neville this I do assure myself
p6825
aVRichard shall live to make the Earl of Warwick
p6826
aVThe greatest man in England but the King
p6827
aVStand forth Dame Eleanor Cobham Gloucester\u2019s wife
p6828
aVIn sight of God and us your guilt is great

p6840
aVWelcome is banishment Welcome were my death
p6841
aVEleanor the law thou seest hath judged thee

aVAh Humphrey this dishonor in thine age
p6845
aVWill bring thy head with sorrow to the ground
p6846
aVI beseech your Majesty give me leave to go

aVGod and King Henry govern England\u2019s realm

aVAs others would ambitiously receive it
p6863
aVFarewell good king When I am dead and gone

p6868
aVHis lady banished and a limb lopped off
p6869
aVThis staff of honor raught there let it stand
p6870
aVWhere it best fits to be in Henry\u2019s hand

aVThus Eleanor\u2019s pride dies in her youngest days
p6873
aVLords let him go Please it your Majesty
p6874

aVSo cares and joys abound as seasons fleet
p6895
aVSirs what\u2019s o\u2019clock
p6896
aVTen my lord

aVUneath may she endure the flinty streets
p6900
aVTo tread them with her tender-feeling feet
p6901
aVSweet Nell ill can thy noble mind abrook
p6902
aVThe abject people gazing on thy face
p6903
aVWith envious looks laughing at thy shame
p6904
aVThat erst did follow thy proud chariot wheels
p6905
aVWhen thou didst ride in triumph through the streets
p6906
aVBut soft I think she comes and I\u2019ll prepare
p6907
aVMy tearstained eyes to see her miseries
p6908
aVSo please your Grace we\u2019ll take her from the Sheriff
p6909
aVNo stir not for your lives Let her pass by
p6910
aVCome you my lord to see my open shame
p6911
aVNow thou dost penance too Look how they gaze
p6912
aVSee how the giddy multitude do point
p6913
aVAnd nod their heads and throw their eyes on thee
p6914
aVAh Gloucester hide thee from their hateful looks
p6915
aVAnd in thy closet pent up rue my shame
p6916
aVAnd ban thine enemies both mine and thine
p6917
aVBe patient gentle Nell Forget this grief
p6918
aVAh Gloucester teach me to forget myself
p6919
aVFor whilst I think I am thy married wife
p6920
aVAnd thou a prince Protector of this land
p6921
aVMethinks I should not thus be led along
p6922
aVMailed up in shame with papers on my back
p6923
aVAnd followed with a rabble that rejoice
p6924
aVTo see my tears and hear my deep-fet groans
p6925
aVThe ruthless flint doth cut my tender feet
p6926
aVAnd when I start the envious people laugh
p6927
aVAnd bid me be advisèd how I tread
p6928
aVAh Humphrey can I bear this shameful yoke
p6929
aVTrowest thou that e\u2019er I\u2019ll look upon the world
p6930
aVOr count them happy that enjoys the sun
p6931
aVNo dark shall be my light and night my day
p6932
aVTo think upon my pomp shall be my hell
p6933
aVSometimes I\u2019ll say I am Duke Humphrey\u2019s wife
p6934
aVAnd he a prince and ruler of the land
p6935
aVYet so he ruled and such a prince he was
p6936
aVAs he stood by whilst I his forlorn duchess
p6937
aVWas made a wonder and a pointing-stock
p6938
aVTo every idle rascal follower
p6939
aVBut be thou mild and blush not at my shame
p6940
aVNor stir at nothing till the ax of death
p6941
aVHang over thee as sure it shortly will
p6942
aVFor Suffolk he that can do all in all
p6943
aVWith her that hateth thee and hates us all
p6944
aVAnd York and impious Beaufort that false priest
p6945
aVHave all limed bushes to betray thy wings
p6946
aVAnd fly thou how thou canst they\u2019ll tangle thee
p6947
aVBut fear not thou until thy foot be snared
p6948
aVNor never seek prevention of thy foes
p6949
aVAh Nell forbear Thou aimest all awry
p6950
aVI must offend before I be attainted
p6951
aVAnd had I twenty times so many foes
p6952
aVAnd each of them had twenty times their power
p6953
aVAll these could not procure me any scathe
p6954
aVSo long as I am loyal true and crimeless
p6955
aVWouldst have me rescue thee from this reproach
p6956
aVWhy yet thy scandal were not wiped away
p6957
aVBut I in danger for the breach of law
p6958
aVThy greatest help is quiet gentle Nell

aV\u2019Tis not his wont to be the hindmost man
p7004
aVWhate\u2019er occasion keeps him from us now
p7005
aVCan you not see or will you not observe
p7006
aVThe strangeness of his altered countenance
p7007
aVWith what a majesty he bears himself
p7008
aVHow insolent of late he is become
p7009
aVHow proud how peremptory and unlike himself
p7010
aVWe know the time since he was mild and affable
p7011
aVAnd if we did but glance a far-off look
p7012
aVImmediately he was upon his knee
p7013
aVThat all the court admired him for submission
p7014
aVBut meet him now and be it in the morn
p7015
aVWhen everyone will give the time of day
p7016
aVHe knits his brow and shows an angry eye
p7017
aVAnd passeth by with stiff unbowèd knee
p7018
aVDisdaining duty that to us belongs
p7019
aVSmall curs are not regarded when they grin
p7020
aVBut great men tremble when the lion roars
p7021
aVAnd Humphrey is no little man in England
p7022
aVFirst note that he is near you in descent

aVAnd should you fall he is the next will mount
p7024
aVMeseemeth then it is no policy
p7025
aVRespecting what a rancorous mind he bears
p7026
aVAnd his advantage following your decease
p7027
aVThat he should come about your royal person
p7028
aVOr be admitted to your Highness\u2019 Council
p7029
aVBy flattery hath he won the Commons\u2019 hearts
p7030
aVAnd when he please to make commotion
p7031
aV\u2019Tis to be feared they all will follow him
p7032
aVNow \u2019tis the spring and weeds are shallow-rooted
p7033
aVSuffer them now and they\u2019ll o\u2019ergrow the garden
p7034
aVAnd choke the herbs for want of husbandry
p7035
aVThe reverent care I bear unto my lord
p7036
aVMade me collect these dangers in the Duke
p7037
aVIf it be fond call it a woman\u2019s fear
p7038
aVWhich fear if better reasons can supplant
p7039
aVI will subscribe and say I wronged the Duke
p7040
aVMy lords of Suffolk Buckingham and York
p7041
aVReprove my allegation if you can
p7042
aVOr else conclude my words effectual
p7043
aVWell hath your Highness seen into this duke
p7044
aVAnd had I first been put to speak my mind
p7045
aVI think I should have told your Grace\u2019s tale
p7046
aVThe Duchess by his subornation
p7047
aVUpon my life began her devilish practices
p7048
aVOr if he were not privy to those faults
p7049
aVYet by reputing of his high descent
p7050
aVAs next the King he was successive heir
p7051
aVAnd such high vaunts of his nobility
p7052
aVDid instigate the bedlam brainsick duchess
p7053
aVBy wicked means to frame our sovereign\u2019s fall
p7054
aVSmooth runs the water where the brook is deep
p7055
aVAnd in his simple show he harbors treason
p7056
aVThe fox barks not when he would steal the lamb
p7057
aVNo no my sovereign Gloucester is a man
p7058
aVUnsounded yet and full of deep deceit
p7059
aVDid he not contrary to form of law
p7060
aVDevise strange deaths for small offenses done
p7061
aVAnd did he not in his protectorship
p7062
aVLevy great sums of money through the realm
p7063
aVFor soldiers\u2019 pay in France and never sent it
p7064
aVBy means whereof the towns each day revolted
p7065
aVTut these are petty faults to faults unknown
p7066
aVWhich time will bring to light in smooth Duke Humphrey
p7067
aVMy lords at once the care you have of us
p7068
aVTo mow down thorns that would annoy our foot
p7069
aVIs worthy praise but shall I speak my conscience
p7070
aVOur kinsman Gloucester is as innocent
p7071
aVFrom meaning treason to our royal person
p7072
aVAs is the sucking lamb or harmless dove
p7073
aVThe Duke is virtuous mild and too well given
p7074
aVTo dream on evil or to work my downfall
p7075
aVAh what\u2019s more dangerous than this fond affiance
p7076
aVSeems he a dove His feathers are but borrowed
p7077
aVFor he\u2019s disposèd as the hateful raven
p7078
aVIs he a lamb His skin is surely lent him
p7079
aVFor he\u2019s inclined as is the ravenous wolves
p7080
aVWho cannot steal a shape that means deceit
p7081
aVTake heed my lord the welfare of us all
p7082
aVHangs on the cutting short that fraudful man
p7083
aVAll health unto my gracious sovereign
p7084
aVWelcome Lord Somerset What news from France
p7085
aVThat all your interest in those territories
p7086
aVIs utterly bereft you All is lost
p7087
aVCold news Lord Somerset but God\u2019s will be done
p7088
aVCold news for me for I had hope of France
p7089
aVAs firmly as I hope for fertile England
p7090
aVThus are my blossoms blasted in the bud
p7091
aVAnd caterpillars eat my leaves away
p7092
aVBut I will remedy this gear ere long
p7093
aVOr sell my title for a glorious grave
p7094
aVAll happiness unto my lord the King
p7095
aVPardon my liege that I have stayed so long
p7096
aVNay Gloucester know that thou art come too soon
p7097
aVUnless thou wert more loyal than thou art
p7098
aVI do arrest thee of high treason here
p7099
aVWell Suffolk thou shalt not see me blush
p7100
aVNor change my countenance for this arrest
p7101
aVA heart unspotted is not easily daunted
p7102
aVThe purest spring is not so free from mud
p7103
aVAs I am clear from treason to my sovereign
p7104
aVWho can accuse me Wherein am I guilty
p7105
aV\u2019Tis thought my lord that you took bribes of France
p7106
aVAnd being Protector stayed the soldiers\u2019 pay
p7107
aVBy means whereof his Highness hath lost France
p7108
aVIs it but thought so What are they that think it
p7109
aVI never robbed the soldiers of their pay
p7110
aVNor ever had one penny bribe from France
p7111
aVSo help me God as I have watched the night
p7112
aVAy night by night in studying good for England
p7113
aVThat doit that e\u2019er I wrested from the King
p7114
aVOr any groat I hoarded to my use
p7115
aVBe brought against me at my trial day
p7116
aVNo many a pound of mine own proper store
p7117
aVBecause I would not tax the needy Commons
p7118
aVHave I dispursèd to the garrisons
p7119
aVAnd never asked for restitution
p7120
aVIt serves you well my lord to say so much
p7121
aVI say no more than truth so help me God
p7122
aVIn your protectorship you did devise
p7123
aVStrange tortures for offenders never heard of
p7124
aVThat England was defamed by tyranny
p7125
aVWhy \u2019tis well known that whiles I was Protector
p7126
aVPity was all the fault that was in me
p7127
aVFor I should melt at an offender\u2019s tears
p7128
aVAnd lowly words were ransom for their fault
p7129
aVUnless it were a bloody murderer
p7130
aVOr foul felonious thief that fleeced poor passengers
p7131
aVI never gave them condign punishment
p7132
aVMurder indeed that bloody sin I tortured
p7133
aVAbove the felon or what trespass else
p7134
aVMy lord these faults are easy quickly answered
p7135
aVBut mightier crimes are laid unto your charge
p7136
aVWhereof you cannot easily purge yourself
p7137
aVI do arrest you in his Highness\u2019 name
p7138
aVAnd here commit you to my Lord Cardinal
p7139
aVTo keep until your further time of trial
p7140
aVMy lord of Gloucester \u2019tis my special hope
p7141
aVThat you will clear yourself from all suspense
p7142
aVMy conscience tells me you are innocent
p7143
aVAh gracious lord these days are dangerous
p7144
aVVirtue is choked with foul ambition
p7145
aVAnd charity chased hence by rancor\u2019s hand
p7146
aVFoul subornation is predominant
p7147
aVAnd equity exiled your Highness\u2019 land
p7148
aVI know their complot is to have my life
p7149
aVAnd if my death might make this island happy
p7150
aVAnd prove the period of their tyranny
p7151
aVI would expend it with all willingness
p7152
aVBut mine is made the prologue to their play
p7153
aVFor thousands more that yet suspect no peril
p7154
aVWill not conclude their plotted tragedy
p7155
aVBeaufort\u2019s red sparkling eyes blab his heart\u2019s malice
p7156
aVAnd Suffolk\u2019s cloudy brow his stormy hate
p7157
aVSharp Buckingham unburdens with his tongue
p7158
aVThe envious load that lies upon his heart
p7159
aVAnd dogged York that reaches at the moon
p7160
aVWhose overweening arm I have plucked back
p7161
aVBy false accuse doth level at my life
p7162
aVAnd you my sovereign lady with the rest
p7163
aVCauseless have laid disgraces on my head
p7164
aVAnd with your best endeavor have stirred up
p7165
aVMy liefest liege to be mine enemy
p7166
aVAy all of you have laid your heads together
p7167
aVMyself had notice of your conventicles
p7168
aVAnd all to make away my guiltless life
p7169
aVI shall not want false witness to condemn me
p7170
aVNor store of treasons to augment my guilt
p7171
aVThe ancient proverb will be well effected
p7172
aVA staff is quickly found to beat a dog
p7173
aVMy liege his railing is intolerable
p7174
aVIf those that care to keep your royal person
p7175
aVFrom treason\u2019s secret knife and traitor\u2019s rage
p7176
aVBe thus upbraided chid and rated at
p7177
aVAnd the offender granted scope of speech
p7178
aV\u2019Twill make them cool in zeal unto your Grace
p7179
aVHath he not twit our sovereign lady here
p7180
aVWith ignominious words though clerkly couched
p7181
aVAs if she had subornèd some to swear
p7182
aVFalse allegations to o\u2019erthrow his state
p7183
aVBut I can give the loser leave to chide
p7184
aVFar truer spoke than meant I lose indeed
p7185
aVBeshrew the winners for they played me false
p7186
aVAnd well such losers may have leave to speak
p7187
aVHe\u2019ll wrest the sense and hold us here all day
p7188
aVLord Cardinal he is your prisoner
p7189
aVSirs take away the Duke and guard him sure
p7190
aVAh thus King Henry throws away his crutch
p7191
aVBefore his legs be firm to bear his body
p7192
aVThus is the shepherd beaten from thy side
p7193
aVAnd wolves are gnarling who shall gnaw thee first
p7194
aVAh that my fear were false ah that it were
p7195
aVFor good King Henry thy decay I fear
p7196
aVMy lords what to your wisdoms seemeth best
p7197
aVDo or undo as if ourself were here
p7198
aVWhat will your Highness leave the Parliament
p7199
aVAy Margaret My heart is drowned with grief
p7200
aVWhose flood begins to flow within mine eyes
p7201
aVMy body round engirt with misery
p7202
aVFor what\u2019s more miserable than discontent
p7203
aVAh uncle Humphrey in thy face I see
p7204
aVThe map of honor truth and loyalty
p7205
aVAnd yet good Humphrey is the hour to come
p7206
aVThat e\u2019er I proved thee false or feared thy faith
p7207
aVWhat louring star now envies thy estate
p7208
aVThat these great lords and Margaret our queen
p7209
aVDo seek subversion of thy harmless life
p7210
aVThou never didst them wrong nor no man wrong
p7211
aVAnd as the butcher takes away the calf
p7212
aVAnd binds the wretch and beats it when it strains
p7213
aVBearing it to the bloody slaughterhouse
p7214
aVEven so remorseless have they borne him hence
p7215
aVAnd as the dam runs lowing up and down
p7216
aVLooking the way her harmless young one went
p7217
aVAnd can do naught but wail her darling\u2019s loss
p7218
aVEven so myself bewails good Gloucester\u2019s case
p7219
aVWith sad unhelpful tears and with dimmed eyes
p7220
aVLook after him and cannot do him good
p7221
aVSo mighty are his vowèd enemies
p7222
aVHis fortunes I will weep and \u2019twixt each groan
p7223
aVSay Who\u2019s a traitor Gloucester he is none
p7224
aVFree lords cold snow melts with the sun\u2019s hot beams
p7225
aVHenry my lord is cold in great affairs
p7226
aVToo full of foolish pity and Gloucester\u2019s show
p7227
aVBeguiles him as the mournful crocodile
p7228
aVWith sorrow snares relenting passengers
p7229
aVOr as the snake rolled in a flow\u2019ring bank
p7230
aVWith shining checkered slough doth sting a child
p7231
aVThat for the beauty thinks it excellent
p7232
aVBelieve me lords were none more wise than I
p7233
aVAnd yet herein I judge mine own wit good
p7234
aVThis Gloucester should be quickly rid the world
p7235
aVTo rid us from the fear we have of him
p7236
aVThat he should die is worthy policy
p7237
aVBut yet we want a color for his death
p7238
aV\u2019Tis meet he be condemned by course of law
p7239
aVBut in my mind that were no policy
p7240
aVThe King will labor still to save his life
p7241
aVThe Commons haply rise to save his life
p7242
aVAnd yet we have but trivial argument
p7243
aVMore than mistrust that shows him worthy death
p7244
aVSo that by this you would not have him die
p7245
aVAh York no man alive so fain as I
p7246
aV\u2019Tis York that hath more reason for his death
p7247
aVBut my Lord Cardinal and you my lord of Suffolk
p7248
aVSay as you think and speak it from your souls
p7249
aVWere \u2019t not all one an empty eagle were set
p7250
aVTo guard the chicken from a hungry kite
p7251
aVAs place Duke Humphrey for the King\u2019s Protector
p7252
aVSo the poor chicken should be sure of death
p7253
aVMadam \u2019tis true and were \u2019t not madness then
p7254
aVTo make the fox surveyor of the fold
p7255
aVWho being accused a crafty murderer
p7256
aVHis guilt should be but idly posted over
p7257
aVBecause his purpose is not executed
p7258
aVNo let him die in that he is a fox
p7259
aVBy nature proved an enemy to the flock
p7260
aVBefore his chaps be stained with crimson blood
p7261
aVAs Humphrey proved by reasons to my liege
p7262
aVAnd do not stand on quillets how to slay him
p7263
aVBe it by gins by snares by subtlety
p7264
aVSleeping or waking \u2019Tis no matter how
p7265
aVSo he be dead for that is good deceit
p7266
aVWhich mates him first that first intends deceit
p7267
aVThrice noble Suffolk \u2019tis resolutely spoke
p7268
aVNot resolute except so much were done
p7269
aVFor things are often spoke and seldom meant
p7270
aVBut that my heart accordeth with my tongue
p7271
aVSeeing the deed is meritorious
p7272
aVAnd to preserve my sovereign from his foe
p7273
aVSay but the word and I will be his priest
p7274
aVBut I would have him dead my lord of Suffolk
p7275
aVEre you can take due orders for a priest
p7276
aVSay you consent and censure well the deed
p7277
aVAnd I\u2019ll provide his executioner
p7278
aVI tender so the safety of my liege
p7279
aVHere is my hand The deed is worthy doing
p7280
aVAnd so say I
p7281
aVAnd I And now we three have spoke it
p7282
aVIt skills not greatly who impugns our doom
p7283
aVGreat lords from Ireland am I come amain
p7284
aVTo signify that rebels there are up
p7285
aVAnd put the Englishmen unto the sword
p7286
aVSend succors lords and stop the rage betime
p7287
aVBefore the wound do grow uncurable
p7288
aVFor being green there is great hope of help
p7289
aVA breach that craves a quick expedient stop
p7290
aVWhat counsel give you in this weighty cause
p7291
aVThat Somerset be sent as regent thither
p7292
aV\u2019Tis meet that lucky ruler be employed
p7293
aVWitness the fortune he hath had in France
p7294
aVIf York with all his far-fet policy
p7295
aVHad been the regent there instead of me
p7296
aVHe never would have stayed in France so long
p7297
aVNo not to lose it all as thou hast done
p7298
aVI rather would have lost my life betimes
p7299
aVThan bring a burden of dishonor home
p7300
aVBy staying there so long till all were lost
p7301
aVShow me one scar charactered on thy skin
p7302
aVMen\u2019s flesh preserved so whole do seldom win
p7303
aVNay then this spark will prove a raging fire
p7304
aVIf wind and fuel be brought to feed it with
p7305
aVNo more good York Sweet Somerset be still
p7306
aVThy fortune York hadst thou been regent there
p7307
aVMight happily have proved far worse than his
p7308
aVWhat worse than naught Nay then a shame take all
p7309
aVAnd in the number thee that wishest shame
p7310
aVMy lord of York try what your fortune is
p7311
aVTh\u2019 uncivil kerns of Ireland are in arms
p7312
aVAnd temper clay with blood of Englishmen
p7313
aVTo Ireland will you lead a band of men
p7314
aVCollected choicely from each county some
p7315
aVAnd try your hap against the Irishmen
p7316
aVI will my lord so please his Majesty
p7317
aVWhy our authority is his consent
p7318
aVAnd what we do establish he confirms
p7319
aVThen noble York take thou this task in hand
p7320
aVI am content Provide me soldiers lords
p7321
aVWhiles I take order for mine own affairs
p7322
aVA charge Lord York that I will see performed
p7323
aVBut now return we to the false Duke Humphrey
p7324
aVNo more of him for I will deal with him
p7325
aVThat henceforth he shall trouble us no more
p7326
aVAnd so break off the day is almost spent
p7327
aVLord Suffolk you and I must talk of that event
p7328
aVMy lord of Suffolk within fourteen days
p7329
aVAt Bristow I expect my soldiers
p7330
aVFor there I\u2019ll ship them all for Ireland
p7331
aVI\u2019ll see it truly done my lord of York
p7332
aVNow York or never steel thy fearful thoughts
p7333
aVAnd change misdoubt to resolution
p7334
aVBe that thou hop\u2019st to be or what thou art
p7335
aVResign to death it is not worth th\u2019 enjoying
p7336
aVLet pale-faced fear keep with the mean-born man
p7337
aVAnd find no harbor in a royal heart
p7338
aVFaster than springtime showers comes thought on thought
p7339
aVAnd not a thought but thinks on dignity
p7340
aVMy brain more busy than the laboring spider
p7341
aVWeaves tedious snares to trap mine enemies
p7342
aVWell nobles well \u2019tis politicly done
p7343
aVTo send me packing with an host of men
p7344
aVI fear me you but warm the starvèd snake
p7345
aVWho cherished in your breasts will sting your hearts
p7346
aV\u2019Twas men I lacked and you will give them me
p7347
aVI take it kindly Yet be well assured
p7348
aVYou put sharp weapons in a madman\u2019s hands
p7349
aVWhiles I in Ireland nourish a mighty band
p7350
aVI will stir up in England some black storm
p7351
aVShall blow ten thousand souls to heaven or hell
p7352
aVAnd this fell tempest shall not cease to rage
p7353
aVUntil the golden circuit on my head
p7354
aVLike to the glorious sun\u2019s transparent beams
p7355
aVDo calm the fury of this mad-bred flaw
p7356
aVAnd for a minister of my intent
p7357
aVI have seduced a headstrong Kentishman
p7358
aVJohn Cade of Ashford
p7359
aVTo make commotion as full well he can
p7360
aVUnder the title of John Mortimer
p7361
aVIn Ireland have I seen this stubborn Cade
p7362
aVOppose himself against a troop of kerns
p7363
aVAnd fought so long till that his thighs with darts
p7364
aVWere almost like a sharp-quilled porpentine
p7365
aVAnd in the end being rescued I have seen
p7366
aVHim caper upright like a wild Morisco
p7367
aVShaking the bloody darts as he his bells
p7368
aVFull often like a shag-haired crafty kern
p7369
aVHath he conversèd with the enemy
p7370
aVAnd undiscovered come to me again
p7371
aVAnd given me notice of their villainies
p7372
aVThis devil here shall be my substitute
p7373
aVFor that John Mortimer which now is dead
p7374
aVIn face in gait in speech he doth resemble
p7375
aVBy this I shall perceive the Commons\u2019 mind
p7376
aVHow they affect the house and claim of York
p7377
aVSay he be taken racked and torturèd
p7378
aVI know no pain they can inflict upon him
p7379
aVWill make him say I moved him to those arms
p7380
aVSay that he thrive as \u2019tis great like he will
p7381
aVWhy then from Ireland come I with my strength
p7382
aVAnd reap the harvest which that rascal sowed
p7383
aVFor Humphrey being dead as he shall be
p7384
aVAnd Henry put apart the next for me
p7385
aVRun to my lord of Suffolk Let him know
p7386
aVWe have dispatched the Duke as he commanded
p7387
aVO that it were to do What have we done

aVWhat doth my lord of Suffolk comfort me
p7425
aVCame he right now to sing a raven\u2019s note
p7426
aVWhose dismal tune bereft my vital powers
p7427
aVAnd thinks he that the chirping of a wren
p7428
aVBy crying comfort from a hollow breast
p7429
aVCan chase away the first-conceivèd sound
p7430
aVHide not thy poison with such sugared words
p7431
aVLay not thy hands on me Forbear I say
p7432
aVTheir touch affrights me as a serpent\u2019s sting
p7433
aVThou baleful messenger out of my sight
p7434
aVUpon thy eyeballs murderous Tyranny
p7435
aVSits in grim majesty to fright the world
p7436
aVLook not upon me for thine eyes are wounding
p7437
aVYet do not go away Come basilisk
p7438
aVAnd kill the innocent gazer with thy sight
p7439
aVFor in the shade of death I shall find joy
p7440
aVIn life but double death now Gloucester\u2019s dead
p7441
aVWhy do you rate my lord of Suffolk thus
p7442
aVAlthough the Duke was enemy to him
p7443
aVYet he most Christian-like laments his death
p7444
aVAnd for myself foe as he was to me
p7445
aVMight liquid tears or heart-offending groans
p7446
aVOr blood-consuming sighs recall his life
p7447
aVI would be blind with weeping sick with groans
p7448
aVLook pale as primrose with blood-drinking sighs
p7449
aVAnd all to have the noble duke alive
p7450
aVWhat know I how the world may deem of me
p7451
aVFor it is known we were but hollow friends
p7452
aVIt may be judged I made the Duke away
p7453
aVSo shall my name with slander\u2019s tongue be wounded
p7454
aVAnd princes\u2019 courts be filled with my reproach
p7455
aVThis get I by his death Ay me unhappy
p7456
aVTo be a queen and crowned with infamy
p7457
aVAh woe is me for Gloucester wretched man
p7458
aVBe woe for me more wretched than he is
p7459
aVWhat dost thou turn away and hide thy face
p7460
aVI am no loathsome leper Look on me
p7461
aVWhat art thou like the adder waxen deaf
p7462
aVBe poisonous too and kill thy forlorn queen
p7463
aVIs all thy comfort shut in Gloucester\u2019s tomb
p7464
aVWhy then Dame Margaret was ne\u2019er thy joy
p7465
aVErect his statue and worship it
p7466
aVAnd make my image but an alehouse sign
p7467
aVWas I for this nigh-wracked upon the sea
p7468
aVAnd twice by awkward wind from England\u2019s bank
p7469
aVDrove back again unto my native clime
p7470
aVWhat boded this but well forewarning wind
p7471
aVDid seem to say Seek not a scorpion\u2019s nest
p7472
aVNor set no footing on this unkind shore
p7473
aVWhat did I then but cursed the gentle gusts
p7474
aVAnd he that loosed them forth their brazen caves
p7475
aVAnd bid them blow towards England\u2019s blessèd shore
p7476
aVOr turn our stern upon a dreadful rock
p7477
aVYet Aeolus would not be a murderer
p7478
aVBut left that hateful office unto thee
p7479
aVThe pretty-vaulting sea refused to drown me
p7480
aVKnowing that thou wouldst have me drowned on shore
p7481
aVWith tears as salt as sea through thy unkindness
p7482
aVThe splitting rocks cow\u2019red in the sinking sands
p7483
aVAnd would not dash me with their ragged sides
p7484
aVBecause thy flinty heart more hard than they
p7485
aVMight in thy palace perish Margaret
p7486
aVAs far as I could ken thy chalky cliffs
p7487
aVWhen from thy shore the tempest beat us back
p7488
aVI stood upon the hatches in the storm
p7489
aVAnd when the dusky sky began to rob
p7490
aVMy earnest-gaping sight of thy land\u2019s view
p7491
aVI took a costly jewel from my neck
p7492
aVA heart it was bound in with diamonds
p7493
aVAnd threw it towards thy land The sea received it
p7494
aVAnd so I wished thy body might my heart
p7495
aVAnd even with this I lost fair England\u2019s view
p7496
aVAnd bid mine eyes be packing with my heart
p7497
aVAnd called them blind and dusky spectacles
p7498
aVFor losing ken of Albion\u2019s wishèd coast
p7499
aVHow often have I tempted Suffolk\u2019s tongue
p7500
aVThe agent of thy foul inconstancy
p7501
aVTo sit and watch me as Ascanius did
p7502
aVWhen he to madding Dido would unfold
p7503
aVHis father\u2019s acts commenced in burning Troy
p7504
aVAm I not witched like her or thou not false like him
p7505
aVAy me I can no more Die Margaret
p7506
aVFor Henry weeps that thou dost live so long
p7507
aVIt is reported mighty sovereign
p7508
aVThat good Duke Humphrey traitorously is murdered
p7509
aVBy Suffolk and the Cardinal Beaufort\u2019s means
p7510
aVThe Commons like an angry hive of bees
p7511
aVThat want their leader scatter up and down
p7512
aVAnd care not who they sting in his revenge
p7513
aVMyself have calmed their spleenful mutiny
p7514
aVUntil they hear the order of his death
p7515
aVThat he is dead good Warwick \u2019tis too true
p7516
aVBut how he died God knows not Henry
p7517
aVEnter his chamber view his breathless corpse
p7518
aVAnd comment then upon his sudden death
p7519
aVThat shall I do my liege Stay Salisbury
p7520
aVWith the rude multitude till I return
p7521
aVO Thou that judgest all things stay my thoughts
p7522
aVMy thoughts that labor to persuade my soul
p7523
aVSome violent hands were laid on Humphrey\u2019s life
p7524
aVIf my suspect be false forgive me God
p7525
aVFor judgment only doth belong to Thee
p7526
aVFain would I go to chafe his paly lips
p7527
aVWith twenty thousand kisses and to drain
p7528
aVUpon his face an ocean of salt tears
p7529
aVTo tell my love unto his dumb deaf trunk
p7530
aVAnd with my fingers feel his hand unfeeling
p7531
aVBut all in vain are these mean obsequies
p7532
aVAnd to survey his dead and earthy image
p7533
aVWhat were it but to make my sorrow greater
p7534
aVCome hither gracious sovereign View this body
p7535
aVThat is to see how deep my grave is made
p7536
aVFor with his soul fled all my worldly solace
p7537
aVFor seeing him I see my life in death
p7538
aVAs surely as my soul intends to live
p7539
aVWith that dread King that took our state upon Him
p7540
aVTo free us from His Father\u2019s wrathful curse
p7541
aVI do believe that violent hands were laid
p7542
aVUpon the life of this thrice-famèd duke
p7543
aVA dreadful oath sworn with a solemn tongue
p7544
aVWhat instance gives Lord Warwick for his vow
p7545
aVSee how the blood is settled in his face
p7546
aVOft have I seen a timely-parted ghost
p7547
aVOf ashy semblance meager pale and bloodless
p7548
aVBeing all descended to the laboring heart
p7549
aVWho in the conflict that it holds with death
p7550
aVAttracts the same for aidance \u2019gainst the enemy
p7551
aVWhich with the heart there cools and ne\u2019er returneth
p7552
aVTo blush and beautify the cheek again
p7553
aVBut see his face is black and full of blood
p7554
aVHis eyeballs further out than when he lived
p7555
aVStaring full ghastly like a strangled man
p7556
aVHis hair upreared his nostrils stretched with struggling
p7557
aVHis hands abroad displayed as one that grasped
p7558
aVAnd tugged for life and was by strength subdued
p7559
aVLook on the sheets his hair you see is sticking
p7560
aVHis well-proportioned beard made rough and rugged
p7561
aVLike to the summer\u2019s corn by tempest lodged
p7562
aVIt cannot be but he was murdered here
p7563
aVThe least of all these signs were probable
p7564
aVWhy Warwick who should do the Duke to death
p7565
aVMyself and Beaufort had him in protection
p7566
aVAnd we I hope sir are no murderers
p7567
aVBut both of you were vowed Duke Humphrey\u2019s foes
p7568
aVTo Cardinal And you forsooth had the good duke to keep
p7569
aV\u2019Tis like you would not feast him like a friend
p7570
aVAnd \u2019tis well seen he found an enemy
p7571
aVThen you belike suspect these noblemen
p7572
aVAs guilty of Duke Humphrey\u2019s timeless death
p7573
aVWho finds the heifer dead and bleeding fresh
p7574
aVAnd sees fast by a butcher with an ax
p7575
aVBut will suspect \u2019twas he that made the slaughter
p7576
aVWho finds the partridge in the puttock\u2019s nest
p7577
aVBut may imagine how the bird was dead
p7578
aVAlthough the kite soar with unbloodied beak
p7579
aVEven so suspicious is this tragedy
p7580
aVAre you the butcher Suffolk Where\u2019s your knife
p7581
aVIs Beaufort termed a kite Where are his talons
p7582
aVI wear no knife to slaughter sleeping men
p7583
aVBut here\u2019s a vengeful sword rusted with ease
p7584
aVThat shall be scoured in his rancorous heart
p7585
aVThat slanders me with murder\u2019s crimson badge
p7586
aVSay if thou dar\u2019st proud lord of Warwickshire
p7587
aVThat I am faulty in Duke Humphrey\u2019s death
p7588
aVWhat dares not Warwick if false Suffolk dare him
p7589
aVHe dares not calm his contumelious spirit
p7590
aVNor cease to be an arrogant controller
p7591
aVThough Suffolk dare him twenty thousand times
p7592
aVMadam be still with reverence may I say
p7593
aVFor every word you speak in his behalf
p7594
aVIs slander to your royal dignity
p7595
aVBlunt-witted lord ignoble in demeanor
p7596
aVIf ever lady wronged her lord so much
p7597
aVThy mother took into her blameful bed
p7598
aVSome stern untutored churl and noble stock
p7599
aVWas graft with crab-tree slip whose fruit thou art
p7600
aVAnd never of the Nevilles\u2019 noble race
p7601
aVBut that the guilt of murder bucklers thee
p7602
aVAnd I should rob the deathsman of his fee
p7603
aVQuitting thee thereby of ten thousand shames
p7604
aVAnd that my sovereign\u2019s presence makes me mild
p7605
aVI would false murd\u2019rous coward on thy knee
p7606
aVMake thee beg pardon for thy passèd speech
p7607
aVAnd say it was thy mother that thou meant\u2019st
p7608
aVThat thou thyself wast born in bastardy
p7609
aVAnd after all this fearful homage done
p7610
aVGive thee thy hire and send thy soul to hell
p7611
aVPernicious bloodsucker of sleeping men
p7612
aVThou shalt be waking while I shed thy blood
p7613
aVIf from this presence thou dar\u2019st go with me
p7614
aVAway even now or I will drag thee hence
p7615
aVUnworthy though thou art I\u2019ll cope with thee
p7616
aVAnd do some service to Duke Humphrey\u2019s ghost
p7617
aVWhat stronger breastplate than a heart untainted
p7618
aVThrice is he armed that hath his quarrel just
p7619
aVAnd he but naked though locked up in steel
p7620
aVWhose conscience with injustice is corrupted
p7621
aVWhat noise is this
p7622
aVWhy how now lords Your wrathful weapons drawn
p7623
aVHere in our presence Dare you be so bold
p7624
aVWhy what tumultuous clamor have we here
p7625
aVThe trait\u2019rous Warwick with the men of Bury
p7626
aVSet all upon me mighty sovereign
p7627
aVSirs stand apart The King shall know your mind
p7628
aVDread lord the Commons send you word by me
p7629
aVUnless Lord Suffolk straight be done to death
p7630
aVOr banishèd fair England\u2019s territories
p7631
aVThey will by violence tear him from your palace
p7632
aVAnd torture him with grievous ling\u2019ring death
p7633
aVThey say by him the good duke Humphrey died
p7634
aVThey say in him they fear your Highness\u2019 death
p7635
aVAnd mere instinct of love and loyalty
p7636
aVFree from a stubborn opposite intent
p7637
aVAs being thought to contradict your liking
p7638
aVMakes them thus forward in his banishment
p7639
aVThey say in care of your most royal person
p7640
aVThat if your Highness should intend to sleep
p7641
aVAnd charge that no man should disturb your rest
p7642
aVIn pain of your dislike or pain of death
p7643
aVYet notwithstanding such a strait edict
p7644
aVWere there a serpent seen with forkèd tongue
p7645
aVThat slyly glided towards your Majesty
p7646
aVIt were but necessary you were waked
p7647
aVLest being suffered in that harmful slumber
p7648
aVThe mortal worm might make the sleep eternal
p7649
aVAnd therefore do they cry though you forbid
p7650
aVThat they will guard you whe\u2019er you will or no
p7651
aVFrom such fell serpents as false Suffolk is
p7652
aVWith whose envenomèd and fatal sting
p7653
aVYour loving uncle twenty times his worth
p7654
aVThey say is shamefully bereft of life
p7655
aVAn answer from the King my lord of Salisbury
p7656
aV\u2019Tis like the Commons rude unpolished hinds
p7657
aVCould send such message to their sovereign
p7658
aVTo Salisbury But you my lord were glad to be employed
p7659
aVTo show how quaint an orator you are
p7660
aVBut all the honor Salisbury hath won
p7661
aVIs that he was the lord ambassador
p7662
aVSent from a sort of tinkers to the King
p7663
aVAn answer from the King or we will all break in
p7664
aVGo Salisbury and tell them all from me
p7665
aVI thank them for their tender loving care
p7666
aVAnd had I not been cited so by them
p7667
aVYet did I purpose as they do entreat
p7668
aVFor sure my thoughts do hourly prophesy
p7669
aVMischance unto my state by Suffolk\u2019s means
p7670
aVAnd therefore by His Majesty I swear
p7671
aVWhose far unworthy deputy I am
p7672
aVHe shall not breathe infection in this air
p7673
aVBut three days longer on the pain of death
p7674
aVO Henry let me plead for gentle Suffolk
p7675
aVUngentle queen to call him gentle Suffolk
p7676
aVNo more I say If thou dost plead for him
p7677
aVThou wilt but add increase unto my wrath
p7678
aVHad I but said I would have kept my word
p7679
aVBut when I swear it is irrevocable
p7680
aVTo Suffolk If after three days\u2019 space thou here be\u2019st found
p7681
aVOn any ground that I am ruler of
p7682
aVThe world shall not be ransom for thy life
p7683
aVCome Warwick come good Warwick go with me
p7684
aVI have great matters to impart to thee
p7685
aVMischance and sorrow go along with you
p7686
aVHeart\u2019s discontent and sour affliction
p7687
aVBe playfellows to keep you company
p7688
aVThere\u2019s two of you the devil make a third
p7689
aVAnd threefold vengeance tend upon your steps
p7690
aVCease gentle queen these execrations
p7691
aVAnd let thy Suffolk take his heavy leave
p7692
aVFie coward woman and soft-hearted wretch
p7693
aVHast thou not spirit to curse thine enemies
p7694
aVA plague upon them Wherefore should I curse them
p7695
aVCould curses kill as doth the mandrake\u2019s groan
p7696
aVI would invent as bitter searching terms
p7697
aVAs curst as harsh and horrible to hear
p7698
aVDelivered strongly through my fixèd teeth
p7699
aVWith full as many signs of deadly hate
p7700
aVAs lean-faced Envy in her loathsome cave
p7701
aVMy tongue should stumble in mine earnest words
p7702
aVMine eyes should sparkle like the beaten flint
p7703
aVMine hair be fixed on end as one distract
p7704
aVAy every joint should seem to curse and ban
p7705
aVAnd even now my burdened heart would break
p7706
aVShould I not curse them Poison be their drink
p7707
aVGall worse than gall the daintiest that they taste
p7708
aVTheir sweetest shade a grove of cypress trees
p7709
aVTheir chiefest prospect murd\u2019ring basilisks
p7710
aVTheir softest touch as smart as lizards\u2019 stings
p7711
aVTheir music frightful as the serpent\u2019s hiss
p7712
aVAnd boding screech owls make the consort full
p7713
aVAll the foul terrors in dark-seated hell
p7714
aVEnough sweet Suffolk thou torment\u2019st thyself
p7715
aVAnd these dread curses like the sun \u2019gainst glass
p7716
aVOr like an over-chargèd gun recoil
p7717
aVAnd turn the force of them upon thyself
p7718
aVYou bade me ban and will you bid me leave
p7719
aVNow by the ground that I am banished from
p7720
aVWell could I curse away a winter\u2019s night
p7721
aVThough standing naked on a mountain top
p7722
aVWhere biting cold would never let grass grow
p7723
aVAnd think it but a minute spent in sport
p7724
aVO let me entreat thee cease Give me thy hand
p7725
aVThat I may dew it with my mournful tears
p7726
aVNor let the rain of heaven wet this place
p7727
aVTo wash away my woeful monuments
p7728
aVO could this kiss be printed in thy hand
p7729
aVThat thou mightst think upon these by the seal
p7730
aVThrough whom a thousand sighs are breathed for thee
p7731
aVSo get thee gone that I may know my grief
p7732
aV\u2019Tis but surmised whiles thou art standing by
p7733
aVAs one that surfeits thinking on a want
p7734
aVI will repeal thee or be well assured
p7735
aVAdventure to be banishèd myself
p7736
aVAnd banishèd I am if but from thee
p7737
aVGo speak not to me Even now be gone
p7738
aVO go not yet Even thus two friends condemned
p7739
aVEmbrace and kiss and take ten thousand leaves
p7740
aVLoather a hundred times to part than die
p7741
aVYet now farewell and farewell life with thee
p7742
aVThus is poor Suffolk ten times banishèd
p7743
aVOnce by the King and three times thrice by thee
p7744
aV\u2019Tis not the land I care for wert thou thence
p7745
aVA wilderness is populous enough
p7746
aVSo Suffolk had thy heavenly company
p7747
aVFor where thou art there is the world itself
p7748
aVWith every several pleasure in the world
p7749
aVAnd where thou art not desolation
p7750
aVI can no more Live thou to joy thy life

p7752
aVWhither goes Vaux so fast What news I prithee
p7753
aVTo signify unto his Majesty
p7754
aVThat Cardinal Beaufort is at point of death
p7755
aVFor suddenly a grievous sickness took him
p7756
aVThat makes him gasp and stare and catch the air
p7757
aVBlaspheming God and cursing men on Earth
p7758
aVSometimes he talks as if Duke Humphrey\u2019s ghost
p7759
aVWere by his side sometimes he calls the King
p7760
aVAnd whispers to his pillow as to him
p7761
aVThe secrets of his overchargèd soul
p7762
aVAnd I am sent to tell his Majesty
p7763
aVThat even now he cries aloud for him
p7764
aVGo tell this heavy message to the King
p7765
aVAy me What is this world What news are these
p7766
aVBut wherefore grieve I at an hour\u2019s poor loss
p7767
aVOmitting Suffolk\u2019s exile my soul\u2019s treasure
p7768
aVWhy only Suffolk mourn I not for thee
p7769
aVAnd with the southern clouds contend in tears
p7770
aVTheirs for the earth\u2019s increase mine for my sorrows\u2019
p7771
aVNow get thee hence The King thou know\u2019st is coming
p7772
aVIf thou be found by me thou art but dead
p7773
aVIf I depart from thee I cannot live
p7774
aVAnd in thy sight to die what were it else
p7775
aVBut like a pleasant slumber in thy lap
p7776
aVHere could I breathe my soul into the air
p7777
aVAs mild and gentle as the cradle babe
p7778
aVDying with mother\u2019s dug between its lips
p7779
aVWhere from thy sight I should be raging mad
p7780
aVAnd cry out for thee to close up mine eyes

aVTo have thee with thy lips to stop my mouth
p7782
aVSo shouldst thou either turn my flying soul
p7783
aVOr I should breathe it so into thy body
p7784
aVAnd then it lived in sweet Elysium
p7785
aVTo die by thee were but to die in jest
p7786
aVFrom thee to die were torture more than death
p7787
aVO let me stay befall what may befall

aVIt is applièd to a deathful wound
p7790
aVTo France sweet Suffolk Let me hear from thee
p7791
aVFor wheresoe\u2019er thou art in this world\u2019s globe
p7792
aVI\u2019ll have an Iris that shall find thee out

aVHow fares my lord Speak Beaufort to thy sovereign
p7801
aVIf thou be\u2019st Death I\u2019ll give thee England\u2019s treasure
p7802
aVEnough to purchase such another island
p7803
aVSo thou wilt let me live and feel no pain
p7804
aVAh what a sign it is of evil life
p7805
aVWhere Death\u2019s approach is seen so terrible
p7806
aVBeaufort it is thy sovereign speaks to thee

aVBring me unto my trial when you will

aVCan I make men live whe\u2019er they will or no
p7810
aVO torture me no more I will confess
p7811
aVAlive again Then show me where he is

aVHe hath no eyes The dust hath blinded them

aVThat lays strong siege unto this wretch\u2019s soul

aVThat drag the tragic melancholy night
p7837
aVWho with their drowsy slow and flagging wings
p7838
aVClip dead men\u2019s graves and from their misty jaws
p7839
aVBreathe foul contagious darkness in the air
p7840
aVTherefore bring forth the soldiers of our prize
p7841
aVFor whilst our pinnace anchors in the Downs
p7842
aVHere shall they make their ransom on the sand
p7843
aVOr with their blood stain this discolored shore
p7844
aVMaster this prisoner freely give I thee
p7845
aVAnd thou that art his mate make boot of this

p7856
aVAnd so will I and write home for it straight
p7857
aVI lost mine eye in laying the prize aboard

aVGualtier or Walter which it is I care not

aVTherefore when merchantlike I sell revenge
p7874
aVBroke be my sword my arms torn and defaced
p7875
aVAnd I proclaimed a coward through the world
p7876
aVStay Whitmore for thy prisoner is a prince

aVThis small inheritance my father left me

aVContenteth me and worth a monarchy

aVWhy rude companion whatsoe\u2019er thou be
p8233
aVI know thee not Why then should I betray thee
p8234
aVIs \u2019t not enough to break into my garden
p8235
aVAnd like a thief to come to rob my grounds

aVClimbing my walls in spite of me the owner

aVBut thou wilt brave me with these saucy terms
p8238
aVNay it shall ne\u2019er be said while England stands
p8239
aVThat Alexander Iden an esquire of Kent

aVThy hand is but a finger to my fist
p8245
aVThy leg a stick comparèd with this truncheon
p8246
aVMy foot shall fight with all the strength thou hast
p8247
aVAnd if mine arm be heavèd in the air

aVThy grave is digged already in the earth

aVAnd hang thee o\u2019er my tomb when I am dead
p8254
aVNe\u2019er shall this blood be wipèd from thy point
p8255
aVBut thou shalt wear it as a herald\u2019s coat

aVTo emblaze the honor that thy master got
p8257
aVHow much thou wrong\u2019st me heaven be my judge
p8258
aVDie damnèd wretch the curse of her that bare thee

aVSo wish I I might thrust thy soul to hell
p8261
aVHence will I drag thee headlong by the heels
p8262
aVUnto a dunghill which shall be thy grave
p8263
aVAnd there cut off thy most ungracious head
p8264
aVWhich I will bear in triumph to the King
p8265
aVLeaving thy trunk for crows to feed upon
p8266
aVFrom Ireland thus comes York to claim his right
p8267
aVAnd pluck the crown from feeble Henry\u2019s head
p8268
aVRing bells aloud Burn bonfires clear and bright

aVTo entertain great England\u2019s lawful king

aVThis hand was made to handle naught but gold

aVI cannot give due action to my words

aVExcept a sword or scepter balance it

aVA scepter shall it have have I a soul

aVOn which I\u2019ll toss the fleur-de-luce of France
p8277
aVAside Whom have we here Buckingham to disturb me
p8278
aVThe King hath sent him sure I must dissemble
p8279
aVYork if thou meanest well I greet thee well
p8280
aVHumphrey of Buckingham I accept thy greeting
p8281
aVArt thou a messenger or come of pleasure
p8282
aVA messenger from Henry our dread liege
p8283
aVTo know the reason of these arms in peace
p8284
aVOr why thou being a subject as I am
p8285
aVAgainst thy oath and true allegiance sworn
p8286
aVShould raise so great a power without his leave
p8287
aVOr dare to bring thy force so near the court
p8288
aVScarce can I speak my choler is so great
p8289
aVO I could hew up rocks and fight with flint
p8290
aVI am so angry at these abject terms
p8291
aVAnd now like Ajax Telamonius
p8292
aVOn sheep or oxen could I spend my fury
p8293
aVI am far better born than is the King
p8294
aVMore like a king more kingly in my thoughts
p8295
aVBut I must make fair weather yet awhile
p8296
aVTill Henry be more weak and I more strong
p8297
aVBuckingham I prithee pardon me
p8298
aVThat I have given no answer all this while
p8299
aVMy mind was troubled with deep melancholy
p8300
aVThe cause why I have brought this army hither
p8301
aVIs to remove proud Somerset from the King
p8302
aVSeditious to his Grace and to the state
p8303
aVThat is too much presumption on thy part
p8304
aVBut if thy arms be to no other end
p8305
aVThe King hath yielded unto thy demand
p8306
aVThe Duke of Somerset is in the Tower
p8307
aVUpon thine honor is he prisoner
p8308
aVUpon mine honor he is prisoner
p8309
aVThen Buckingham I do dismiss my powers
p8310
aVSoldiers I thank you all Disperse yourselves
p8311
aVMeet me tomorrow in Saint George\u2019s field
p8312
aVYou shall have pay and everything you wish

p8319
aVYork I commend this kind submission
p8320
aVWe twain will go into his Highness\u2019 tent
p8321
aVBuckingham doth York intend no harm to us
p8322
aVThat thus he marcheth with thee arm in arm
p8323
aVIn all submission and humility
p8324
aVYork doth present himself unto your Highness
p8325
aVThen what intends these forces thou dost bring
p8326
aVTo heave the traitor Somerset from hence
p8327
aVAnd fight against that monstrous rebel Cade
p8328
aVWho since I heard to be discomfited
p8329
aVIf one so rude and of so mean condition
p8330
aVMay pass into the presence of a king
p8331
aVLo I present your Grace a traitor\u2019s head

aVAnd never live but true unto his liege
p8348
aVSee Buckingham Somerset comes with th\u2019 Queen
p8349
aVGo bid her hide him quickly from the Duke
p8350
aVFor thousand Yorks he shall not hide his head
p8351
aVBut boldly stand and front him to his face
p8352
aVHow now Is Somerset at liberty
p8353
aVThen York unloose thy long-imprisoned thoughts
p8354
aVAnd let thy tongue be equal with thy heart
p8355
aVShall I endure the sight of Somerset
p8356
aVFalse king why hast thou broken faith with me

aVThe deadly-handed Clifford slew my steed
p8491
aVBut match to match I have encountered him

aVOf one or both of us the time is come

aVWith thy brave bearing should I be in love
p8502
aVBut that thou art so fast mine enemy

aVCan we outrun the heavens Good Margaret stay
p8555
aVWhat are you made of You\u2019ll nor fight nor fly

aVNow is it manhood wisdom and defense
p8557
aVTo give the enemy way and to secure us
p8558
aVBy what we can which can no more but fly
p8559
aVIf you be ta\u2019en we then should see the bottom

aVAs well we may if not through your neglect

aVWe shall to London get where you are loved

aVOf Salisbury who can report of him
p8573
aVThat winter lion who in rage forgets

aVAgèd contusions and all brush of time
p8575
aVAnd like a gallant in the brow of youth
p8576
aVRepairs him with occasion This happy day
p8577
aVIs not itself nor have we won one foot
p8578
aVIf Salisbury be lost
p8579
aVMy noble father
p8580
aVThree times today I holp him to his horse
p8581
aVThree times bestrid him Thrice I led him off
p8582
aVPersuaded him from any further act
p8583
aVBut still where danger was still there I met him
p8584
aVAnd like rich hangings in a homely house
p8585
aVSo was his will in his old feeble body
p8586
aVBut noble as he is look where he comes
p8587
aVNow by my sword well hast thou fought today

aVBy th\u2019 Mass so did we all I thank you Richard

aVWell lords we have not got that which we have
p8593
aV\u2019Tis not enough our foes are this time fled
p8594
aVBeing opposites of such repairing nature

aVFor as I hear the King is fled to London
p8597
aVTo call a present court of Parliament
p8598
aVLet us pursue him ere the writs go forth
p8599
aVWhat says Lord Warwick Shall we after them

p8601
aVNow by my hand lords \u2019twas a glorious day

aVSaint Albans battle won by famous York
p8603
aVShall be eternized in all age to come
p8604
aVSound drum and trumpets and to London all

aVAnd more such days as these to us befall

aVCan set the Duke up in despite of me
p8765

aVAnd hung their rotten coffins up in chains
p8985
aVIt could not slake mine ire nor ease my heart
p8986
aVThe sight of any of the house of York

p9009
aVThe army of the Queen hath got the field
p9010
aVMy uncles both are slain in rescuing me

p9013
aVOr lambs pursued by hunger-starvèd wolves
p9014
aVMy sons God knows what hath bechancèd them
p9015
aVBut this I know they have demeaned themselves
p9016
aVLike men borne to renown by life or death
p9017
aVThree times did Richard make a lane to me

aVIn blood of those that had encountered him
p9022
aVAnd when the hardiest warriors did retire
p9023
aVRichard cried Charge and give no foot of ground
p9024
aVAnd cried A crown or else a glorious tomb
p9025
aVA scepter or an earthly sepulcher
p9026
aVWith this we charged again but out alas
p9027
aVWe budged again as I have seen a swan
p9028
aVWith bootless labor swim against the tide
p9029
aVAnd spend her strength with over-matching waves
p9030
aVAh hark the fatal followers do pursue
p9031
aVAnd I am faint and cannot fly their fury
p9032
aVAnd were I strong I would not shun their fury
p9033
aVThe sands are numbered that makes up my life
p9034
aVHere must I stay and here my life must end
p9035
aVCome bloody Clifford rough Northumberland
p9036
aVI dare your quenchless fury to more rage
p9037
aVI am your butt and I abide your shot
p9038
aVYield to our mercy proud Plantagenet
p9039
aVAy to such mercy as his ruthless arm
p9040
aVWith downright payment showed unto my father
p9041
aVNow Phaëton hath tumbled from his car
p9042
aVAnd made an evening at the noontide prick
p9043
aVMy ashes as the Phoenix\u2019 may bring forth
p9044
aVA bird that will revenge upon you all
p9045
aVAnd in that hope I throw mine eyes to heaven
p9046
aVScorning whate\u2019er you can afflict me with
p9047
aVWhy come you not What multitudes and fear
p9048
aVSo cowards fight when they can fly no further
p9049
aVSo doves do peck the falcon\u2019s piercing talons
p9050
aVSo desperate thieves all hopeless of their lives
p9051
aVBreathe out invectives \u2019gainst the officers
p9052
aVO Clifford but bethink thee once again
p9053
aVAnd in thy thought o\u2019errun my former time
p9054
aVAnd if thou canst for blushing view this face
p9055
aVAnd bite thy tongue that slanders him with cowardice
p9056
aVWhose frown hath made thee faint and fly ere this
p9057
aVI will not bandy with thee word for word
p9058
aVBut buckler with thee blows twice two for one
p9059
aVHold valiant Clifford for a thousand causes
p9060
aVI would prolong a while the traitor\u2019s life
p9061
aVWrath makes him deaf speak thou Northumberland
p9062
aVHold Clifford do not honor him so much
p9063
aVTo prick thy finger though to wound his heart
p9064
aVWhat valor were it when a cur doth grin
p9065
aVFor one to thrust his hand between his teeth
p9066
aVWhen he might spurn him with his foot away
p9067
aVIt is war\u2019s prize to take all vantages
p9068
aVAnd ten to one is no impeach of valor
p9069
aVAy ay so strives the woodcock with the gin
p9070
aVSo doth the coney struggle in the net
p9071
aVSo triumph thieves upon their conquered booty
p9072
aVSo true men yield with robbers so o\u2019ermatched
p9073
aVWhat would your Grace have done unto him now
p9074
aVBrave warriors Clifford and Northumberland
p9075
aVCome make him stand upon this molehill here
p9076
aVThat raught at mountains with outstretchèd arms
p9077
aVYet parted but the shadow with his hand
p9078
aVWhat was it you that would be England\u2019s king
p9079
aVWas \u2019t you that reveled in our parliament
p9080
aVAnd made a preachment of your high descent
p9081
aVWhere are your mess of sons to back you now
p9082
aVThe wanton Edward and the lusty George
p9083
aVAnd where\u2019s that valiant crookback prodigy
p9084
aVDickie your boy that with his grumbling voice
p9085
aVWas wont to cheer his dad in mutinies
p9086
aVOr with the rest where is your darling Rutland
p9087
aVLook York I stained this napkin with the blood
p9088
aVThat valiant Clifford with his rapier\u2019s point
p9089
aVMade issue from the bosom of the boy
p9090
aVAnd if thine eyes can water for his death
p9091
aVI give thee this to dry thy cheeks withal
p9092
aVAlas poor York but that I hate thee deadly
p9093
aVI should lament thy miserable state
p9094
aVI prithee grieve to make me merry York
p9095
aVWhat hath thy fiery heart so parched thine entrails
p9096
aVThat not a tear can fall for Rutland\u2019s death
p9097
aVWhy art thou patient man Thou shouldst be mad
p9098
aVAnd I to make thee mad do mock thee thus
p9099
aVStamp rave and fret that I may sing and dance
p9100
aVThou would\u2019st be fee\u2019d I see to make me sport
p9101
aVYork cannot speak unless he wear a crown
p9102
aVA crown for York
p9103
aVAnd lords bow low to him
p9104
aVHold you his hands whilst I do set it on
p9105
aVAy marry sir now looks he like a king
p9106
aVAy this is he that took King Henry\u2019s chair
p9107
aVAnd this is he was his adopted heir
p9108
aVBut how is it that great Plantagenet
p9109
aVIs crowned so soon and broke his solemn oath
p9110
aVAs I bethink me you should not be king
p9111
aVTill our King Henry had shook hands with Death
p9112
aVAnd will you pale your head in Henry\u2019s glory
p9113
aVAnd rob his temples of the diadem
p9114
aVNow in his life against your holy oath
p9115
aVO \u2019tis a fault too too unpardonable
p9116
aVOff with the crown and with the crown his head
p9117
aVAnd whilst we breathe take time to do him dead
p9118
aVThat is my office for my father\u2019s sake
p9119
aVNay stay let\u2019s hear the orisons he makes
p9120
aVShe-wolf of France but worse than wolves of France
p9121
aVWhose tongue more poisons than the adder\u2019s tooth
p9122
aVHow ill-beseeming is it in thy sex
p9123
aVTo triumph like an Amazonian trull
p9124
aVUpon their woes whom Fortune captivates
p9125
aVBut that thy face is vizard-like unchanging
p9126
aVMade impudent with use of evil deeds
p9127
aVI would assay proud queen to make thee blush
p9128
aVTo tell thee whence thou cam\u2019st of whom derived
p9129
aVWere shame enough to shame thee wert thou not shameless
p9130
aVThy father bears the type of King of Naples
p9131
aVOf both the Sicils and Jerusalem
p9132
aVYet not so wealthy as an English yeoman
p9133
aVHath that poor monarch taught thee to insult
p9134
aVIt needs not nor it boots thee not proud queen
p9135
aVUnless the adage must be verified
p9136
aVThat beggars mounted run their horse to death
p9137
aV\u2019Tis beauty that doth oft make women proud
p9138
aVBut God He knows thy share thereof is small
p9139
aV\u2019Tis virtue that doth make them most admired
p9140
aVThe contrary doth make thee wondered at
p9141
aV\u2019Tis government that makes them seem divine
p9142
aVThe want thereof makes thee abominable
p9143
aVThou art as opposite to every good
p9144
aVAs the Antipodes are unto us
p9145
aVOr as the south to the Septentrion
p9146
aVO tiger\u2019s heart wrapped in a woman\u2019s hide
p9147
aVHow couldst thou drain the lifeblood of the child
p9148
aVTo bid the father wipe his eyes withal
p9149
aVAnd yet be seen to bear a woman\u2019s face
p9150
aVWomen are soft mild pitiful and flexible
p9151
aVThou stern obdurate flinty rough remorseless
p9152
aVBidd\u2019st thou me rage Why now thou hast thy wish
p9153
aVWouldst have me weep Why now thou hast thy will
p9154
aVFor raging wind blows up incessant showers
p9155
aVAnd when the rage allays the rain begins
p9156
aVThese tears are my sweet Rutland\u2019s obsequies
p9157
aVAnd every drop cries vengeance for his death
p9158
aV\u2019Gainst thee fell Clifford and thee false Frenchwoman
p9159
aVBeshrew me but his passions moves me so
p9160
aVThat hardly can I check my eyes from tears
p9161
aVThat face of his the hungry cannibals
p9162
aVWould not have touched would not have stained with blood
p9163
aVBut you are more inhuman more inexorable
p9164
aVO ten times more than tigers of Hyrcania
p9165
aVSee ruthless queen a hapless father\u2019s tears
p9166
aVThis cloth thou dipped\u2019st in blood of my sweet boy
p9167
aVAnd I with tears do wash the blood away
p9168
aVKeep thou the napkin and go boast of this
p9169
aVAnd if thou tell\u2019st the heavy story right
p9170
aVUpon my soul the hearers will shed tears
p9171
aVYea even my foes will shed fast-falling tears
p9172
aVAnd say Alas it was a piteous deed
p9173
aVThere take the crown and with the crown my curse
p9174
aVAnd in thy need such comfort come to thee
p9175
aVAs now I reap at thy too cruel hand
p9176
aVHard-hearted Clifford take me from the world
p9177
aVMy soul to heaven my blood upon your heads
p9178
aVHad he been slaughterman to all my kin
p9179
aVI should not for my life but weep with him
p9180
aVTo see how inly sorrow gripes his soul
p9181
aVWhat weeping ripe my Lord Northumberland
p9182
aVThink but upon the wrong he did us all
p9183
aVAnd that will quickly dry thy melting tears
p9184
aVHere\u2019s for my oath here\u2019s for my father\u2019s death
p9185
aVAnd here\u2019s to right our gentle-hearted king
p9186
aVOpen thy gate of mercy gracious God
p9187
aVMy soul flies through these wounds to seek out Thee
p9188
aVOff with his head and set it on York gates
p9189
aVSo York may overlook the town of York
p9190
aVI wonder how our princely father scaped
p9191
aVOr whether he be scaped away or no
p9192
aVFrom Clifford\u2019s and Northumberland\u2019s pursuit
p9193
aVHad he been ta\u2019en we should have heard the news
p9194
aVHad he been slain we should have heard the news
p9195
aVOr had he scaped methinks we should have heard
p9196
aVThe happy tidings of his good escape
p9197
aVHow fares my brother Why is he so sad
p9198
aVI cannot joy until I be resolved
p9199
aVWhere our right valiant father is become
p9200
aVI saw him in the battle range about
p9201
aVAnd watched him how he singled Clifford forth
p9202
aVMethought he bore him in the thickest troop
p9203
aVAs doth a lion in a herd of neat
p9204
aVOr as a bear encompassed round with dogs
p9205
aVWho having pinched a few and made them cry
p9206
aVThe rest stand all aloof and bark at him
p9207
aVSo fared our father with his enemies
p9208
aVSo fled his enemies my warlike father
p9209
aVMethinks \u2019tis prize enough to be his son
p9210
aVSee how the morning opes her golden gates
p9211
aVAnd takes her farewell of the glorious sun
p9212
aVHow well resembles it the prime of youth
p9213
aVTrimmed like a younker prancing to his love
p9214
aVDazzle mine eyes or do I see three suns
p9215
aVThree glorious suns each one a perfect sun
p9216
aVNot separated with the racking clouds
p9217
aVBut severed in a pale clear-shining sky
p9218
aVSee see they join embrace and seem to kiss
p9219
aVAs if they vowed some league inviolable
p9220
aVNow are they but one lamp one light one sun
p9221
aVIn this the heaven figures some event
p9222
aV\u2019Tis wondrous strange the like yet never heard of
p9223
aVI think it cites us brother to the field
p9224
aVThat we the sons of brave Plantagenet
p9225
aVEach one already blazing by our meeds
p9226
aVShould notwithstanding join our lights together
p9227
aVAnd overshine the earth as this the world
p9228
aVWhate\u2019er it bodes henceforward will I bear
p9229
aVUpon my target three fair shining suns
p9230
aVNay bear three daughters by your leave I speak it
p9231
aVYou love the breeder better than the male
p9232
aVBut what art thou whose heavy looks foretell
p9233
aVSome dreadful story hanging on thy tongue
p9234
aVAh one that was a woeful looker-on
p9235
aVWhenas the noble Duke of York was slain
p9236
aVYour princely father and my loving lord
p9237
aVO speak no more for I have heard too much
p9238
aVSay how he died for I will hear it all
p9239
aVEnvironèd he was with many foes
p9240
aVAnd stood against them as the hope of Troy
p9241
aVAgainst the Greeks that would have entered Troy
p9242
aVBut Hercules himself must yield to odds
p9243
aVAnd many strokes though with a little axe
p9244
aVHews down and fells the hardest-timbered oak
p9245
aVBy many hands your father was subdued
p9246
aVBut only slaughtered by the ireful arm
p9247
aVOf unrelenting Clifford and the Queen
p9248
aVWho crowned the gracious duke in high despite
p9249
aVLaughed in his face and when with grief he wept
p9250
aVThe ruthless queen gave him to dry his cheeks
p9251
aVA napkin steepèd in the harmless blood
p9252
aVOf sweet young Rutland by rough Clifford slain
p9253
aVAnd after many scorns many foul taunts
p9254
aVThey took his head and on the gates of York
p9255
aVThey set the same and there it doth remain
p9256
aVThe saddest spectacle that e\u2019er I viewed
p9257
aVSweet Duke of York our prop to lean upon
p9258
aVNow thou art gone we have no staff no stay
p9259
aVO Clifford boist\u2019rous Clifford thou hast slain
p9260
aVThe flower of Europe for his chivalry
p9261
aVAnd treacherously hast thou vanquished him
p9262
aVFor hand to hand he would have vanquished thee
p9263
aVNow my soul\u2019s palace is become a prison
p9264
aVAh would she break from hence that this my body
p9265
aVMight in the ground be closèd up in rest
p9266
aVFor never henceforth shall I joy again
p9267
aVNever O never shall I see more joy
p9268
aVI cannot weep for all my body\u2019s moisture
p9269
aVScarce serves to quench my furnace-burning heart
p9270
aVNor can my tongue unload my heart\u2019s great burden
p9271
aVFor selfsame wind that I should speak withal
p9272
aVIs kindling coals that fires all my breast
p9273
aVAnd burns me up with flames that tears would quench
p9274
aVTo weep is to make less the depth of grief
p9275
aVTears then for babes blows and revenge for me
p9276
aVRichard I bear thy name I\u2019ll venge thy death
p9277
aVOr die renownèd by attempting it
p9278
aVHis name that valiant duke hath left with thee
p9279
aVHis dukedom and his chair with me is left
p9280
aVNay if thou be that princely eagle\u2019s bird
p9281
aVShow thy descent by gazing \u2019gainst the sun
p9282
aVFor chair and dukedom throne and kingdom say
p9283
aVEither that is thine or else thou wert not his
p9284
aVHow now fair lords What fare what news abroad
p9285
aVGreat lord of Warwick if we should recount
p9286
aVOur baleful news and at each word\u2019s deliverance
p9287
aVStab poniards in our flesh till all were told
p9288
aVThe words would add more anguish than the wounds
p9289
aVO valiant lord the Duke of York is slain
p9290
aVO Warwick Warwick that Plantagenet
p9291
aVWhich held thee dearly as his soul\u2019s redemption
p9292
aVIs by the stern Lord Clifford done to death
p9293
aVTen days ago I drowned these news in tears
p9294
aVAnd now to add more measure to your woes
p9295
aVI come to tell you things sith then befall\u2019n
p9296
aVAfter the bloody fray at Wakefield fought
p9297
aVWhere your brave father breathed his latest gasp
p9298
aVTidings as swiftly as the posts could run
p9299
aVWere brought me of your loss and his depart
p9300
aVI then in London keeper of the King
p9301
aVMustered my soldiers gathered flocks of friends
p9302
aVMarched toward Saint Albans to intercept the Queen
p9303
aVBearing the King in my behalf along
p9304
aVFor by my scouts I was advertisèd
p9305
aVThat she was coming with a full intent
p9306
aVTo dash our late decree in Parliament
p9307
aVTouching King Henry\u2019s oath and your succession
p9308
aVShort tale to make we at Saint Albans met
p9309
aVOur battles joined and both sides fiercely fought
p9310
aVBut whether \u2019twas the coldness of the King
p9311
aVWho looked full gently on his warlike queen
p9312
aVThat robbed my soldiers of their heated spleen
p9313
aVOr whether \u2019twas report of her success
p9314
aVOr more than common fear of Clifford\u2019s rigor
p9315
aVWho thunders to his captives blood and death
p9316
aVI cannot judge but to conclude with truth
p9317
aVTheir weapons like to lightning came and went
p9318
aVOur soldiers\u2019 like the night owl\u2019s lazy flight
p9319
aVOr like an idle thresher with a flail
p9320
aVFell gently down as if they struck their friends
p9321
aVI cheered them up with justice of our cause
p9322
aVWith promise of high pay and great rewards
p9323
aVBut all in vain they had no heart to fight
p9324
aVAnd we in them no hope to win the day
p9325
aVSo that we fled the King unto the Queen
p9326
aVLord George your brother Norfolk and myself
p9327
aVIn haste posthaste are come to join with you
p9328
aVFor in the Marches here we heard you were
p9329
aVMaking another head to fight again
p9330
aVWhere is the Duke of Norfolk gentle Warwick
p9331
aVAnd when came George from Burgundy to England
p9332
aVSome six miles off the Duke is with the soldiers
p9333
aVAnd for your brother he was lately sent
p9334
aVFrom your kind aunt Duchess of Burgundy
p9335
aVWith aid of soldiers to this needful war
p9336
aV\u2019Twas odds belike when valiant Warwick fled
p9337
aVOft have I heard his praises in pursuit
p9338
aVBut ne\u2019er till now his scandal of retire
p9339
aVNor now my scandal Richard dost thou hear
p9340
aVFor thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine
p9341
aVCan pluck the diadem from faint Henry\u2019s head
p9342
aVAnd wring the awful scepter from his fist
p9343
aVWere he as famous and as bold in war
p9344
aVAs he is famed for mildness peace and prayer
p9345
aVI know it well Lord Warwick blame me not
p9346
aV\u2019Tis love I bear thy glories make me speak
p9347
aVBut in this troublous time what\u2019s to be done
p9348
aVShall we go throw away our coats of steel
p9349
aVAnd wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns
p9350
aVNumb\u2019ring our Ave Marys with our beads
p9351
aVOr shall we on the helmets of our foes
p9352
aVTell our devotion with revengeful arms
p9353
aVIf for the last say Ay and to it lords
p9354
aVWhy therefore Warwick came to seek you out
p9355
aVAnd therefore comes my brother Montague
p9356
aVAttend me lords the proud insulting queen
p9357
aVWith Clifford and the haught Northumberland
p9358
aVAnd of their feather many more proud birds
p9359
aVHave wrought the easy-melting king like wax
p9360
aVHe swore consent to your succession
p9361
aVHis oath enrollèd in the Parliament
p9362
aVAnd now to London all the crew are gone
p9363
aVTo frustrate both his oath and what beside
p9364
aVMay make against the house of Lancaster
p9365
aVTheir power I think is thirty thousand strong
p9366
aVNow if the help of Norfolk and myself
p9367
aVWith all the friends that thou brave Earl of March
p9368
aVAmongst the loving Welshmen canst procure
p9369
aVWill but amount to five and twenty thousand
p9370
aVWhy via to London will we march
p9371
aVAnd once again bestride our foaming steeds
p9372
aVAnd once again cry Charge upon our foes
p9373
aVBut never once again turn back and fly
p9374
aVAy now methinks I hear great Warwick speak
p9375
aVNe\u2019er may he live to see a sunshine day
p9376
aVThat cries Retire if Warwick bid him stay
p9377
aVLord Warwick on thy shoulder will I lean
p9378
aVAnd when thou fail\u2019st as God forbid the hour
p9379
aVMust Edward fall which peril heaven forfend
p9380
aVNo longer Earl of March but Duke of York
p9381
aVThe next degree is England\u2019s royal throne
p9382
aVFor King of England shalt thou be proclaimed
p9383
aVIn every borough as we pass along
p9384
aVAnd he that throws not up his cap for joy
p9385
aVShall for the fault make forfeit of his head
p9386
aVKing Edward valiant Richard Montague
p9387
aVStay we no longer dreaming of renown
p9388
aVBut sound the trumpets and about our task
p9389
aVThen Clifford were thy heart as hard as steel
p9390
aVAs thou hast shown it flinty by thy deeds
p9391
aVI come to pierce it or to give thee mine
p9392
aVThen strike up drums God and Saint George for us
p9393
aVHow now what news
p9394
aVThe Duke of Norfolk sends you word by me
p9395
aVThe Queen is coming with a puissant host
p9396
aVAnd craves your company for speedy counsel
p9397
aVWhy then it sorts Brave warriors let\u2019s away
p9398
aVWelcome my lord to this brave town of York
p9399
aVYonder\u2019s the head of that arch-enemy
p9400
aVThat sought to be encompassed with your crown
p9401
aVDoth not the object cheer your heart my lord
p9402
aVAy as the rocks cheer them that fear their wrack
p9403
aVTo see this sight it irks my very soul
p9404
aVWithhold revenge dear God \u2019Tis not my fault
p9405
aVNor wittingly have I infringed my vow
p9406
aVMy gracious liege this too much lenity
p9407
aVAnd harmful pity must be laid aside
p9408
aVTo whom do lions cast their gentle looks
p9409
aVNot to the beast that would usurp their den
p9410
aVWhose hand is that the forest bear doth lick
p9411
aVNot his that spoils her young before her face
p9412
aVWho scapes the lurking serpent\u2019s mortal sting
p9413
aVNot he that sets his foot upon her back
p9414
aVThe smallest worm will turn being trodden on
p9415
aVAnd doves will peck in safeguard of their brood
p9416
aVAmbitious York did level at thy crown
p9417
aVThou smiling while he knit his angry brows
p9418
aVHe but a duke would have his son a king
p9419
aVAnd raise his issue like a loving sire
p9420
aVThou being a king blest with a goodly son
p9421
aVDidst yield consent to disinherit him
p9422
aVWhich argued thee a most unloving father
p9423
aVUnreasonable creatures feed their young
p9424
aVAnd though man\u2019s face be fearful to their eyes
p9425
aVYet in protection of their tender ones
p9426
aVWho hath not seen them even with those wings
p9427
aVWhich sometime they have used with fearful flight
p9428
aVMake war with him that climbed unto their nest
p9429
aVOffering their own lives in their young\u2019s defense
p9430
aVFor shame my liege make them your precedent
p9431
aVWere it not pity that this goodly boy
p9432
aVShould lose his birthright by his father\u2019s fault
p9433
aVAnd long hereafter say unto his child
p9434
aVWhat my great-grandfather and grandsire got
p9435
aVMy careless father fondly gave away
p9436
aVAh what a shame were this Look on the boy
p9437
aVAnd let his manly face which promiseth
p9438
aVSuccessful fortune steel thy melting heart
p9439
aVTo hold thine own and leave thine own with him
p9440
aVFull well hath Clifford played the orator
p9441
aVInferring arguments of mighty force
p9442
aVBut Clifford tell me didst thou never hear
p9443
aVThat things ill got had ever bad success
p9444
aVAnd happy always was it for that son
p9445
aVWhose father for his hoarding went to hell
p9446
aVI\u2019ll leave my son my virtuous deeds behind
p9447
aVAnd would my father had left me no more
p9448
aVFor all the rest is held at such a rate
p9449
aVAs brings a thousandfold more care to keep
p9450
aVThan in possession any jot of pleasure
p9451
aVAh cousin York would thy best friends did know
p9452
aVHow it doth grieve me that thy head is here
p9453
aVMy lord cheer up your spirits our foes are nigh
p9454
aVAnd this soft courage makes your followers faint
p9455
aVYou promised knighthood to our forward son
p9456
aVUnsheathe your sword and dub him presently
p9457
aVEdward kneel down
p9458
aVEdward Plantagenet arise a knight
p9459
aVAnd learn this lesson draw thy sword in right
p9460
aVMy gracious father by your kingly leave
p9461
aVI\u2019ll draw it as apparent to the crown
p9462
aVAnd in that quarrel use it to the death
p9463
aVWhy that is spoken like a toward prince
p9464
aVRoyal commanders be in readiness
p9465
aVFor with a band of thirty thousand men
p9466
aVComes Warwick backing of the Duke of York
p9467
aVAnd in the towns as they do march along
p9468
aVProclaims him king and many fly to him
p9469
aVDeraign your battle for they are at hand
p9470
aVI would your Highness would depart the field
p9471
aVThe Queen hath best success when you are absent
p9472
aVAy good my lord and leave us to our fortune
p9473
aVWhy that\u2019s my fortune too therefore I\u2019ll stay
p9474
aVBe it with resolution then to fight

aVMy royal father cheer these noble lords

aVAnd hearten those that fight in your defense
p9477
aVUnsheathe your sword good father cry Saint George
p9478
aVNow perjured Henry wilt thou kneel for grace
p9479
aVAnd set thy diadem upon my head
p9480
aVOr bide the mortal fortune of the field
p9481
aVGo rate thy minions proud insulting boy
p9482
aVBecomes it thee to be thus bold in terms
p9483
aVBefore thy sovereign and thy lawful king
p9484
aVI am his king and he should bow his knee
p9485
aVI was adopted heir by his consent
p9486
aVSince when his oath is broke for as I hear
p9487
aVYou that are king though he do wear the crown
p9488
aVHave caused him by new act of Parliament
p9489
aVTo blot out me and put his own son in
p9490
aVAnd reason too
p9491
aVWho should succeed the father but the son
p9492
aVAre you there butcher O I cannot speak
p9493
aVAy crookback here I stand to answer thee
p9494
aVOr any he the proudest of thy sort
p9495
aV\u2019Twas you that killed young Rutland was it not
p9496
aVAy and old York and yet not satisfied
p9497
aVFor God\u2019s sake lords give signal to the fight
p9498
aVWhat sayst thou Henry Wilt thou yield the crown
p9499
aVWhy how now long-tongued Warwick dare you speak
p9500
aVWhen you and I met at Saint Albans last
p9501
aVYour legs did better service than your hands
p9502
aVThen \u2019twas my turn to fly and now \u2019tis thine
p9503
aVYou said so much before and yet you fled
p9504
aV\u2019Twas not your valor Clifford drove me thence
p9505
aVNo nor your manhood that durst make you stay
p9506
aVNorthumberland I hold thee reverently
p9507
aVBreak off the parley for scarce I can refrain
p9508
aVThe execution of my big-swoll\u2019n heart
p9509
aVUpon that Clifford that cruel child-killer
p9510
aVI slew thy father call\u2019st thou him a child
p9511
aVAy like a dastard and a treacherous coward
p9512
aVAs thou didst kill our tender brother Rutland
p9513
aVBut ere sunset I\u2019ll make thee curse the deed
p9514
aVHave done with words my lords and hear me speak
p9515
aVDefy them then or else hold close thy lips
p9516
aVI prithee give no limits to my tongue
p9517
aVI am a king and privileged to speak
p9518
aVMy liege the wound that bred this meeting here
p9519
aVCannot be cured by words therefore be still
p9520
aVThen executioner unsheathe thy sword
p9521
aVBy Him that made us all I am resolved
p9522
aVThat Clifford\u2019s manhood lies upon his tongue
p9523
aVSay Henry shall I have my right or no
p9524
aVA thousand men have broke their fasts today
p9525
aVThat ne\u2019er shall dine unless thou yield the crown
p9526
aVIf thou deny their blood upon thy head
p9527
aVFor York in justice puts his armor on
p9528
aVIf that be right which Warwick says is right
p9529
aVThere is no wrong but everything is right
p9530
aVWhoever got thee there thy mother stands
p9531
aVFor well I wot thou hast thy mother\u2019s tongue
p9532
aVBut thou art neither like thy sire nor dam
p9533
aVBut like a foul misshapen stigmatic
p9534
aVMarked by the Destinies to be avoided
p9535
aVAs venom toads or lizards\u2019 dreadful stings
p9536
aVIron of Naples hid with English gilt
p9537
aVWhose father bears the title of a king
p9538
aVAs if a channel should be called the sea
p9539
aVSham\u2019st thou not knowing whence thou art extraught
p9540
aVTo let thy tongue detect thy baseborn heart
p9541
aVA wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns
p9542
aVTo make this shameless callet know herself
p9543
aVHelen of Greece was fairer far than thou
p9544
aVAlthough thy husband may be Menelaus
p9545
aVAnd ne\u2019er was Agamemnon\u2019s brother wronged
p9546
aVBy that false woman as this king by thee
p9547
aVHis father reveled in the heart of France
p9548
aVAnd tamed the King and made the Dauphin stoop
p9549
aVAnd had he matched according to his state
p9550
aVHe might have kept that glory to this day
p9551
aVBut when he took a beggar to his bed
p9552
aVAnd graced thy poor sire with his bridal day
p9553
aVEven then that sunshine brewed a shower for him
p9554
aVThat washed his father\u2019s fortunes forth of France
p9555
aVAnd heaped sedition on his crown at home
p9556
aVFor what hath broached this tumult but thy pride
p9557
aVHadst thou been meek our title still had slept
p9558
aVAnd we in pity of the gentle king
p9559
aVHad slipped our claim until another age
p9560
aVBut when we saw our sunshine made thy spring
p9561
aVAnd that thy summer bred us no increase
p9562
aVWe set the axe to thy usurping root
p9563
aVAnd though the edge hath something hit ourselves
p9564
aVYet know thou since we have begun to strike
p9565
aVWe\u2019ll never leave till we have hewn thee down
p9566
aVOr bathed thy growing with our heated bloods
p9567
aVAnd in this resolution I defy thee
p9568
aVNot willing any longer conference
p9569
aVSince thou denied\u2019st the gentle king to speak
p9570
aVSound trumpets Let our bloody colors wave
p9571
aVAnd either victory or else a grave
p9572
aVStay Edward
p9573
aVNo wrangling woman we\u2019ll no longer stay
p9574
aVThese words will cost ten thousand lives this day
p9575
aVForspent with toil as runners with a race
p9576
aVI lay me down a little while to breathe
p9577
aVFor strokes received and many blows repaid
p9578
aVHave robbed my strong-knit sinews of their strength
p9579
aVAnd spite of spite needs must I rest awhile
p9580
aVSmile gentle heaven or strike ungentle death
p9581
aVFor this world frowns and Edward\u2019s sun is clouded
p9582
aVHow now my lord what hap What hope of good
p9583
aVOur hap is loss our hope but sad despair
p9584
aVOur ranks are broke and ruin follows us
p9585
aVWhat counsel give you Whither shall we fly
p9586
aVBootless is flight they follow us with wings
p9587
aVAnd weak we are and cannot shun pursuit
p9588
aVAh Warwick why hast thou withdrawn thyself
p9589
aVThy brother\u2019s blood the thirsty earth hath drunk
p9590
aVBroached with the steely point of Clifford\u2019s lance
p9591
aVAnd in the very pangs of death he cried
p9592
aVLike to a dismal clangor heard from far
p9593
aVWarwick revenge Brother revenge my death
p9594
aVSo underneath the belly of their steeds
p9595
aVThat stained their fetlocks in his smoking blood
p9596
aVThe noble gentleman gave up the ghost
p9597
aVThen let the earth be drunken with our blood
p9598
aVI\u2019ll kill my horse because I will not fly
p9599
aVWhy stand we like soft-hearted women here
p9600
aVWailing our losses whiles the foe doth rage
p9601
aVAnd look upon as if the tragedy
p9602
aVWere played in jest by counterfeiting actors
p9603
aVHere on my knee I vow to God above
p9604
aVI\u2019ll never pause again never stand still
p9605
aVTill either death hath closed these eyes of mine
p9606
aVOr Fortune given me measure of revenge
p9607
aVO Warwick I do bend my knee with thine
p9608
aVAnd in this vow do chain my soul to thine
p9609
aVAnd ere my knee rise from the Earth\u2019s cold face
p9610
aVI throw my hands mine eyes my heart to Thee
p9611
aVThou setter up and plucker down of kings
p9612
aVBeseeching Thee if with Thy will it stands
p9613
aVThat to my foes this body must be prey
p9614
aVYet that Thy brazen gates of heaven may ope
p9615
aVAnd give sweet passage to my sinful soul
p9616
aVNow lords take leave until we meet again
p9617
aVWhere\u2019er it be in heaven or in Earth
p9618
aVBrother give me thy hand And gentle Warwick
p9619
aVLet me embrace thee in my weary arms
p9620
aVI that did never weep now melt with woe
p9621
aVThat winter should cut off our springtime so
p9622
aVAway away Once more sweet lords farewell
p9623
aVYet let us all together to our troops
p9624
aVAnd give them leave to fly that will not stay
p9625
aVAnd call them pillars that will stand to us
p9626
aVAnd if we thrive promise them such rewards
p9627
aVAs victors wear at the Olympian Games
p9628
aVThis may plant courage in their quailing breasts
p9629
aVFor yet is hope of life and victory
p9630
aVForslow no longer make we hence amain
p9631
aVNow Clifford I have singled thee alone
p9632
aVSuppose this arm is for the Duke of York
p9633
aVAnd this for Rutland both bound to revenge
p9634
aVWert thou environed with a brazen wall
p9635
aVNow Richard I am with thee here alone
p9636
aVThis is the hand that stabbed thy father York
p9637
aVAnd this the hand that slew thy brother Rutland
p9638
aVAnd here\u2019s the heart that triumphs in their death
p9639
aVAnd cheers these hands that slew thy sire and brother
p9640
aVTo execute the like upon thyself
p9641
aVAnd so have at thee
p9642
aVNay Warwick single out some other chase
p9643
aVFor I myself will hunt this wolf to death
p9644
aVThis battle fares like to the morning\u2019s war
p9645
aVWhen dying clouds contend with growing light
p9646
aVWhat time the shepherd blowing of his nails
p9647
aVCan neither call it perfect day nor night
p9648
aVNow sways it this way like a mighty sea
p9649
aVForced by the tide to combat with the wind
p9650
aVNow sways it that way like the selfsame sea
p9651
aVForced to retire by fury of the wind
p9652
aVSometime the flood prevails and then the wind
p9653
aVNow one the better then another best
p9654
aVBoth tugging to be victors breast to breast
p9655
aVYet neither conqueror nor conquerèd
p9656
aVSo is the equal poise of this fell war
p9657
aVHere on this molehill will I sit me down
p9658
aVTo whom God will there be the victory
p9659
aVFor Margaret my queen and Clifford too
p9660
aVHave chid me from the battle swearing both
p9661
aVThey prosper best of all when I am thence
p9662
aVWould I were dead if God\u2019s good will were so
p9663
aVFor what is in this world but grief and woe
p9664
aVO God Methinks it were a happy life
p9665
aVTo be no better than a homely swain
p9666
aVTo sit upon a hill as I do now
p9667
aVTo carve out dials quaintly point by point
p9668
aVThereby to see the minutes how they run
p9669
aVHow many makes the hour full complete
p9670
aVHow many hours brings about the day
p9671
aVHow many days will finish up the year
p9672
aVHow many years a mortal man may live
p9673
aVWhen this is known then to divide the times
p9674
aVSo many hours must I tend my flock
p9675
aVSo many hours must I take my rest
p9676
aVSo many hours must I contemplate
p9677
aVSo many hours must I sport myself
p9678
aVSo many days my ewes have been with young
p9679
aVSo many weeks ere the poor fools will ean
p9680
aVSo many years ere I shall shear the fleece
p9681
aVSo minutes hours days months and years
p9682
aVPassed over to the end they were created
p9683
aVWould bring white hairs unto a quiet grave
p9684
aVAh what a life were this How sweet how lovely
p9685
aVGives not the hawthorn bush a sweeter shade
p9686
aVTo shepherds looking on their silly sheep
p9687
aVThan doth a rich embroidered canopy

aVTo kings that fear their subjects\u2019 treachery
p9689
aVO yes it doth a thousandfold it doth
p9690
aVAnd to conclude the shepherd\u2019s homely curds
p9691
aVHis cold thin drink out of his leather bottle
p9692
aVHis wonted sleep under a fresh tree\u2019s shade
p9693
aVAll which secure and sweetly he enjoys
p9694
aVIs far beyond a prince\u2019s delicates
p9695
aVHis viands sparkling in a golden cup
p9696
aVHis body couchèd in a curious bed
p9697
aVWhen care mistrust and treason waits on him
p9698
aVIll blows the wind that profits nobody
p9699
aVThis man whom hand to hand I slew in fight
p9700
aVMay be possessèd with some store of crowns
p9701
aVAnd I that haply take them from him now
p9702
aVMay yet ere night yield both my life and them

p9815
aVThat led calm Henry though he were a king
p9816
aVAs doth a sail filled with a fretting gust
p9817
aVCommand an argosy to stem the waves
p9818
aVBut think you lords that Clifford fled with them
p9819
aVNo \u2019tis impossible he should escape
p9820
aVFor though before his face I speak the words
p9821
aVYour brother Richard marked him for the grave
p9822
aVAnd wheresoe\u2019er he is he\u2019s surely dead
p9823
aVWhose soul is that which takes her heavy leave
p9824
aVA deadly groan like life and death\u2019s departing
p9825
aVSee who it is and now the battle\u2019s ended
p9826
aVIf friend or foe let him be gently used
p9827
aVRevoke that doom of mercy for \u2019tis Clifford
p9828
aVWho not contented that he lopped the branch
p9829
aVIn hewing Rutland when his leaves put forth
p9830
aVBut set his murd\u2019ring knife unto the root
p9831
aVFrom whence that tender spray did sweetly spring
p9832
aVI mean our princely father Duke of York
p9833
aVFrom off the gates of York fetch down the head
p9834
aVYour father\u2019s head which Clifford placèd there
p9835
aVInstead whereof let this supply the room
p9836
aVMeasure for measure must be answerèd
p9837
aVBring forth that fatal screech owl to our house
p9838
aVThat nothing sung but death to us and ours
p9839
aVNow death shall stop his dismal threat\u2019ning sound
p9840
aVAnd his ill-boding tongue no more shall speak
p9841
aVI think his understanding is bereft
p9842
aVSpeak Clifford dost thou know who speaks to thee
p9843
aVDark cloudy death o\u2019ershades his beams of life
p9844
aVAnd he nor sees nor hears us what we say
p9845
aVO would he did and so perhaps he doth
p9846
aV\u2019Tis but his policy to counterfeit
p9847
aVBecause he would avoid such bitter taunts
p9848
aVWhich in the time of death he gave our father
p9849
aVIf so thou think\u2019st vex him with eager words
p9850
aVClifford ask mercy and obtain no grace
p9851
aVClifford repent in bootless penitence
p9852
aVClifford devise excuses for thy faults
p9853
aVWhile we devise fell tortures for thy faults
p9854
aVThou didst love York and I am son to York
p9855
aVThou pitied\u2019st Rutland I will pity thee
p9856
aVWhere\u2019s Captain Margaret to fence you now
p9857
aVThey mock thee Clifford swear as thou wast wont
p9858
aVWhat not an oath Nay then the world goes hard
p9859
aVWhen Clifford cannot spare his friends an oath
p9860
aVI know by that he\u2019s dead and by my soul
p9861
aVIf this right hand would buy but two hours\u2019 life
p9862
aVThat I in all despite might rail at him
p9863
aVThis hand should chop it off and with the issuing blood
p9864
aVStifle the villain whose unstaunchèd thirst
p9865
aVYork and young Rutland could not satisfy
p9866
aVAy but he\u2019s dead Off with the traitor\u2019s head
p9867
aVAnd rear it in the place your father\u2019s stands
p9868
aVAnd now to London with triumphant march
p9869
aVThere to be crownèd England\u2019s royal king
p9870
aVFrom whence shall Warwick cut the sea to France
p9871
aVAnd ask the Lady Bona for thy queen
p9872
aVSo shalt thou sinew both these lands together
p9873
aVAnd having France thy friend thou shalt not dread
p9874
aVThe scattered foe that hopes to rise again
p9875
aVFor though they cannot greatly sting to hurt
p9876
aVYet look to have them buzz to offend thine ears
p9877
aVFirst will I see the coronation
p9878
aVAnd then to Brittany I\u2019ll cross the sea
p9879
aVTo effect this marriage so it please my lord
p9880
aVEven as thou wilt sweet Warwick let it be
p9881
aVFor in thy shoulder do I build my seat
p9882
aVAnd never will I undertake the thing
p9883
aVWherein thy counsel and consent is wanting
p9884
aVRichard I will create thee Duke of Gloucester
p9885
aVAnd George of Clarence Warwick as ourself
p9886
aVShall do and undo as him pleaseth best
p9887
aVLet me be Duke of Clarence George of Gloucester
p9888
aVFor Gloucester\u2019s dukedom is too ominous
p9889
aVTut that\u2019s a foolish observation
p9890
aVRichard be Duke of Gloucester Now to London
p9891
aVTo see these honors in possession
p9892
aVUnder this thick-grown brake we\u2019ll shroud ourselves
p9893
aVFor through this laund anon the deer will come
p9894
aVAnd in this covert will we make our stand
p9895
aVCulling the principal of all the deer
p9896
aVI\u2019ll stay above the hill so both may shoot
p9897
aVThat cannot be The noise of thy crossbow
p9898
aVWill scare the herd and so my shoot is lost
p9899
aVHere stand we both and aim we at the best
p9900
aVAnd for the time shall not seem tedious
p9901
aVI\u2019ll tell thee what befell me on a day
p9902
aVIn this self place where now we mean to stand
p9903
aVHere comes a man let\u2019s stay till he be past
p9904
aVFrom Scotland am I stol\u2019n even of pure love
p9905
aVTo greet mine own land with my wishful sight
p9906
aVNo Harry Harry \u2019tis no land of thine
p9907
aVThy place is filled thy scepter wrung from thee
p9908
aVThy balm washed off wherewith thou wast anointed
p9909
aVNo bending knee will call thee Caesar now
p9910
aVNo humble suitors press to speak for right
p9911
aVNo not a man comes for redress of thee
p9912
aVFor how can I help them an not myself
p9913
aVAy here\u2019s a deer whose skin\u2019s a keeper\u2019s fee
p9914
aVThis is the quondam king Let\u2019s seize upon him
p9915
aVLet me embrace the sour adversaries
p9916
aVFor wise men say it is the wisest course
p9917
aVWhy linger we Let us lay hands upon him
p9918
aVForbear awhile we\u2019ll hear a little more
p9919
aVMy queen and son are gone to France for aid
p9920
aVAnd as I hear the great commanding Warwick
p9921
aVIs thither gone to crave the French king\u2019s sister
p9922
aVTo wife for Edward If this news be true
p9923
aVPoor queen and son your labor is but lost
p9924
aVFor Warwick is a subtle orator
p9925
aVAnd Lewis a prince soon won with moving words
p9926
aVBy this account then Margaret may win him
p9927
aVFor she\u2019s a woman to be pitied much
p9928
aVHer sighs will make a batt\u2019ry in his breast
p9929
aVHer tears will pierce into a marble heart
p9930
aVThe tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn
p9931
aVAnd Nero will be tainted with remorse
p9932
aVTo hear and see her plaints her brinish tears
p9933
aVAy but she\u2019s come to beg Warwick to give
p9934
aVShe on his left side craving aid for Henry
p9935
aVHe on his right asking a wife for Edward
p9936
aVShe weeps and says her Henry is deposed
p9937
aVHe smiles and says his Edward is installed
p9938
aVThat she poor wretch for grief can speak no more
p9939
aVWhiles Warwick tells his title smooths the wrong
p9940
aVInferreth arguments of mighty strength
p9941
aVAnd in conclusion wins the King from her
p9942
aVWith promise of his sister and what else
p9943
aVTo strengthen and support King Edward\u2019s place
p9944
aVO Margaret thus \u2019twill be and thou poor soul
p9945
aVArt then forsaken as thou went\u2019st forlorn
p9946
aVSay what art thou that talk\u2019st of kings and queens
p9947
aVMore than I seem and less than I was born to
p9948
aVA man at least for less I should not be
p9949
aVAnd men may talk of kings and why not I
p9950
aVAy but thou talk\u2019st as if thou wert a king
p9951
aVWhy so I am in mind and that\u2019s enough
p9952
aVBut if thou be a king where is thy crown
p9953
aVMy crown is in my heart not on my head
p9954
aVNot decked with diamonds and Indian stones
p9955
aVNor to be seen My crown is called content
p9956
aVA crown it is that seldom kings enjoy
p9957
aVWell if you be a king crowned with content
p9958
aVYour crown content and you must be contented
p9959
aVTo go along with us For as we think
p9960
aVYou are the king King Edward hath deposed
p9961
aVAnd we his subjects sworn in all allegiance
p9962
aVWill apprehend you as his enemy
p9963
aVBut did you never swear and break an oath
p9964
aVNo never such an oath nor will not now
p9965
aVWhere did you dwell when I was King of England
p9966
aVHere in this country where we now remain
p9967
aVI was anointed king at nine months old
p9968
aVMy father and my grandfather were kings
p9969
aVAnd you were sworn true subjects unto me
p9970
aVAnd tell me then have you not broke your oaths
p9971
aVNo for we were subjects but while you were king
p9972
aVWhy am I dead Do I not breathe a man
p9973
aVAh simple men you know not what you swear
p9974
aVLook as I blow this feather from my face
p9975
aVAnd as the air blows it to me again
p9976
aVObeying with my wind when I do blow
p9977
aVAnd yielding to another when it blows
p9978
aVCommanded always by the greater gust
p9979
aVSuch is the lightness of you common men
p9980
aVBut do not break your oaths for of that sin
p9981
aVMy mild entreaty shall not make you guilty
p9982
aVGo where you will the King shall be commanded
p9983
aVAnd be you kings command and I\u2019ll obey
p9984
aVWe are true subjects to the King King Edward
p9985
aVSo would you be again to Henry
p9986
aVIf he were seated as King Edward is
p9987
aVWe charge you in God\u2019s name and the King\u2019s
p9988
aVTo go with us unto the officers
p9989
aVIn God\u2019s name lead Your king\u2019s name be obeyed
p9990
aVAnd what God will that let your king perform
p9991
aVAnd what he will I humbly yield unto
p9992
aVBrother of Gloucester at Saint Albans field
p9993
aVThis lady\u2019s husband Sir Richard Grey was slain
p9994
aVHis land then seized on by the conqueror
p9995
aVHer suit is now to repossess those lands
p9996
aVWhich we in justice cannot well deny
p9997
aVBecause in quarrel of the house of York
p9998
aVThe worthy gentleman did lose his life
p9999
aVYour Highness shall do well to grant her suit
p10000
aVIt were dishonor to deny it her
p10001
aVIt were no less but yet I\u2019ll make a pause
p10002
aVYea is it so
p10003
aVI see the lady hath a thing to grant
p10004
aVBefore the King will grant her humble suit

aVGod forbid that for he\u2019ll take vantages

aVHow many children hast thou widow Tell me

p10019
aVNay then whip me he\u2019ll rather give her two

aVThree my most gracious lord
p10021
aVYou shall have four if you\u2019ll be ruled by him
p10022
aV\u2019Twere pity they should lose their father\u2019s lands

aVSo shall you bind me to your Highness\u2019 service
p10035
aVWhat service wilt thou do me if I give them
p10036
aVWhat you command that rests in me to do

aVBut you will take exceptions to my boon

aVAy but thou canst do what I mean to ask

aVFor by that loss I will not purchase them

aVHe is the bluntest wooer in Christendom
p10075
aVHer looks doth argue her replete with modesty
p10076
aVHer words doth show her wit incomparable
p10077
aVAll her perfections challenge sovereignty
p10078
aVOne way or other she is for a king
p10079
aVAnd she shall be my love or else my queen
p10080
aVSay that King Edward take thee for his queen
p10081
aV\u2019Tis better said than done my gracious lord
p10082
aVI am a subject fit to jest withal
p10083
aVBut far unfit to be a sovereign
p10084
aVSweet widow by my state I swear to thee
p10085
aVI speak no more than what my soul intends
p10086
aVAnd that is to enjoy thee for my love
p10087
aVAnd that is more than I will yield unto
p10088
aVI know I am too mean to be your queen
p10089
aVAnd yet too good to be your concubine
p10090
aVYou cavil widow I did mean my queen
p10091
aV\u2019Twill grieve your Grace my sons should call you father
p10092
aVNo more than when my daughters call thee mother
p10093
aVThou art a widow and thou hast some children
p10094
aVAnd by God\u2019s mother I being but a bachelor
p10095
aVHave other some Why \u2019tis a happy thing
p10096
aVTo be the father unto many sons
p10097
aVAnswer no more for thou shalt be my queen
p10098
aVThe ghostly father now hath done his shrift
p10099
aVWhen he was made a shriver \u2019twas for shift
p10100
aVBrothers you muse what chat we two have had
p10101
aVThe widow likes it not for she looks very sad
p10102
aVYou\u2019d think it strange if I should marry her
p10103
aVTo who my lord
p10104
aVWhy Clarence to myself
p10105
aVThat would be ten days\u2019 wonder at the least
p10106
aVThat\u2019s a day longer than a wonder lasts
p10107
aVBy so much is the wonder in extremes
p10108
aVWell jest on brothers I can tell you both
p10109
aVHer suit is granted for her husband\u2019s lands
p10110
aVMy gracious lord Henry your foe is taken
p10111
aVAnd brought your prisoner to your palace gate
p10112
aVSee that he be conveyed unto the Tower
p10113
aVAnd go we brothers to the man that took him
p10114
aVTo question of his apprehension
p10115
aVWidow go you along Lords use her honorably
p10116
aVAy Edward will use women honorably
p10117
aVWould he were wasted marrow bones and all
p10118
aVThat from his loins no hopeful branch may spring
p10119
aVTo cross me from the golden time I look for
p10120
aVAnd yet between my soul\u2019s desire and me
p10121
aVThe lustful Edward\u2019s title burièd
p10122
aVIs Clarence Henry and his son young Edward
p10123
aVAnd all the unlooked-for issue of their bodies
p10124
aVTo take their rooms ere I can place myself
p10125
aVA cold premeditation for my purpose
p10126
aVWhy then I do but dream on sovereignty
p10127
aVLike one that stands upon a promontory
p10128
aVAnd spies a far-off shore where he would tread
p10129
aVWishing his foot were equal with his eye
p10130
aVAnd chides the sea that sunders him from thence
p10131
aVSaying he\u2019ll lade it dry to have his way
p10132
aVSo do I wish the crown being so far off
p10133
aVAnd so I chide the means that keeps me from it
p10134
aVAnd so I say I\u2019ll cut the causes off
p10135
aVFlattering me with impossibilities
p10136
aVMy eye\u2019s too quick my heart o\u2019erweens too much
p10137
aVUnless my hand and strength could equal them
p10138
aVWell say there is no kingdom then for Richard
p10139
aVWhat other pleasure can the world afford
p10140
aVI\u2019ll make my heaven in a lady\u2019s lap
p10141
aVAnd deck my body in gay ornaments
p10142
aVAnd \u2019witch sweet ladies with my words and looks
p10143
aVO miserable thought and more unlikely
p10144
aVThan to accomplish twenty golden crowns
p10145
aVWhy Love forswore me in my mother\u2019s womb
p10146
aVAnd for I should not deal in her soft laws
p10147
aVShe did corrupt frail Nature with some bribe
p10148
aVTo shrink mine arm up like a withered shrub
p10149
aVTo make an envious mountain on my back
p10150
aVWhere sits Deformity to mock my body
p10151
aVTo shape my legs of an unequal size
p10152
aVTo disproportion me in every part
p10153
aVLike to a chaos or an unlicked bear-whelp
p10154
aVThat carries no impression like the dam
p10155
aVAnd am I then a man to be beloved
p10156
aVO monstrous fault to harbor such a thought
p10157
aVThen since this Earth affords no joy to me
p10158
aVBut to command to check to o\u2019erbear such
p10159
aVAs are of better person than myself
p10160
aVI\u2019ll make my heaven to dream upon the crown
p10161
aVAnd whiles I live t\u2019 account this world but hell
p10162
aVUntil my misshaped trunk that bears this head
p10163
aVBe round impalèd with a glorious crown
p10164
aVAnd yet I know not how to get the crown
p10165
aVFor many lives stand between me and home
p10166
aVAnd I like one lost in a thorny wood
p10167
aVThat rents the thorns and is rent with the thorns
p10168
aVSeeking a way and straying from the way
p10169
aVNot knowing how to find the open air
p10170
aVBut toiling desperately to find it out
p10171
aVTorment myself to catch the English crown
p10172
aVAnd from that torment I will free myself
p10173
aVOr hew my way out with a bloody axe
p10174
aVWhy I can smile and murder whiles I smile
p10175
aVAnd cry Content to that which grieves my heart
p10176
aVAnd wet my cheeks with artificial tears
p10177
aVAnd frame my face to all occasions
p10178
aVI\u2019ll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall
p10179
aVI\u2019ll slay more gazers than the basilisk
p10180
aVI\u2019ll play the orator as well as Nestor
p10181
aVDeceive more slyly than Ulysses could
p10182
aVAnd like a Sinon take another Troy
p10183
aVI can add colors to the chameleon
p10184
aVChange shapes with Proteus for advantages
p10185
aVAnd set the murderous Machiavel to school
p10186
aVCan I do this and cannot get a crown
p10187
aVTut were it farther off I\u2019ll pluck it down
p10188
aVFair Queen of England worthy Margaret
p10189
aVSit down with us It ill befits thy state
p10190
aVAnd birth that thou shouldst stand while Lewis doth sit
p10191
aVNo mighty King of France Now Margaret
p10192
aVMust strike her sail and learn awhile to serve
p10193
aVWhere kings command I was I must confess
p10194
aVGreat Albion\u2019s queen in former golden days
p10195
aVBut now mischance hath trod my title down
p10196
aVAnd with dishonor laid me on the ground
p10197
aVWhere I must take like seat unto my fortune
p10198
aVAnd to my humble seat conform myself
p10199
aVWhy say fair queen whence springs this deep despair
p10200
aVFrom such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears
p10201
aVAnd stops my tongue while heart is drowned in cares
p10202
aVWhate\u2019er it be be thou still like thyself
p10203
aVAnd sit thee by our side
p10204
aVYield not thy neck
p10205
aVTo Fortune\u2019s yoke but let thy dauntless mind
p10206
aVStill ride in triumph over all mischance
p10207
aVBe plain Queen Margaret and tell thy grief
p10208
aVIt shall be eased if France can yield relief
p10209
aVThose gracious words revive my drooping thoughts
p10210
aVAnd give my tongue-tied sorrows leave to speak
p10211
aVNow therefore be it known to noble Lewis
p10212
aVThat Henry sole possessor of my love
p10213
aVIs of a king become a banished man
p10214
aVAnd forced to live in Scotland a forlorn
p10215
aVWhile proud ambitious Edward Duke of York
p10216
aVUsurps the regal title and the seat
p10217
aVOf England\u2019s true-anointed lawful king
p10218
aVThis is the cause that I poor Margaret
p10219
aVWith this my son Prince Edward Henry\u2019s heir
p10220
aVAm come to crave thy just and lawful aid
p10221
aVAnd if thou fail us all our hope is done
p10222
aVScotland hath will to help but cannot help
p10223
aVOur people and our peers are both misled
p10224
aVOur treasure seized our soldiers put to flight
p10225
aVAnd as thou seest ourselves in heavy plight
p10226
aVRenownèd queen with patience calm the storm
p10227
aVWhile we bethink a means to break it off
p10228
aVThe more we stay the stronger grows our foe
p10229
aVThe more I stay the more I\u2019ll succor thee
p10230
aVO but impatience waiteth on true sorrow
p10231
aVAnd see where comes the breeder of my sorrow
p10232
aVWhat\u2019s he approacheth boldly to our presence
p10233
aVOur Earl of Warwick Edward\u2019s greatest friend
p10234
aVWelcome brave Warwick What brings thee to France
p10235
aVAy now begins a second storm to rise
p10236
aVFor this is he that moves both wind and tide
p10237
aVFrom worthy Edward King of Albion
p10238
aVMy lord and sovereign and thy vowèd friend
p10239
aVI come in kindness and unfeignèd love
p10240
aVFirst to do greetings to thy royal person
p10241
aVAnd then to crave a league of amity
p10242
aVAnd lastly to confirm that amity
p10243
aVWith nuptial knot if thou vouchsafe to grant
p10244
aVThat virtuous Lady Bona thy fair sister
p10245
aVTo England\u2019s king in lawful marriage
p10246
aVIf that go forward Henry\u2019s hope is done
p10247
aVAnd gracious madam in our king\u2019s behalf
p10248
aVI am commanded with your leave and favor
p10249
aVHumbly to kiss your hand and with my tongue
p10250
aVTo tell the passion of my sovereign\u2019s heart
p10251
aVWhere fame late ent\u2019ring at his heedful ears
p10252
aVHath placed thy beauty\u2019s image and thy virtue
p10253
aVKing Lewis and Lady Bona hear me speak
p10254
aVBefore you answer Warwick His demand
p10255
aVSprings not from Edward\u2019s well-meant honest love
p10256
aVBut from deceit bred by necessity
p10257
aVFor how can tyrants safely govern home
p10258
aVUnless abroad they purchase great alliance
p10259
aVTo prove him tyrant this reason may suffice
p10260
aVThat Henry liveth still but were he dead
p10261
aVYet here Prince Edward stands King Henry\u2019s son
p10262
aVLook therefore Lewis that by this league and marriage
p10263
aVThou draw not on thy danger and dishonor
p10264
aVFor though usurpers sway the rule awhile
p10265
aVYet heav\u2019ns are just and time suppresseth wrongs
p10266
aVInjurious Margaret
p10267
aVAnd why not Queen
p10268
aVBecause thy father Henry did usurp
p10269
aVAnd thou no more art prince than she is queen
p10270
aVThen Warwick disannuls great John of Gaunt
p10271
aVWhich did subdue the greatest part of Spain
p10272
aVAnd after John of Gaunt Henry the Fourth
p10273
aVWhose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest
p10274
aVAnd after that wise prince Henry the Fifth
p10275
aVWho by his prowess conquerèd all France
p10276
aVFrom these our Henry lineally descends
p10277
aVOxford how haps it in this smooth discourse
p10278
aVYou told not how Henry the Sixth hath lost
p10279
aVAll that which Henry the Fifth had gotten
p10280
aVMethinks these peers of France should smile at that
p10281
aVBut for the rest you tell a pedigree
p10282
aVOf threescore and two years a silly time
p10283
aVTo make prescription for a kingdom\u2019s worth
p10284
aVWhy Warwick canst thou speak against thy liege
p10285
aVWhom thou obeyed\u2019st thirty and six years
p10286
aVAnd not bewray thy treason with a blush
p10287
aVCan Oxford that did ever fence the right
p10288
aVNow buckler falsehood with a pedigree
p10289
aVFor shame leave Henry and call Edward king
p10290
aVCall him my king by whose injurious doom
p10291
aVMy elder brother the Lord Aubrey Vere
p10292
aVWas done to death And more than so my father
p10293
aVEven in the downfall of his mellowed years
p10294
aVWhen nature brought him to the door of death
p10295
aVNo Warwick no While life upholds this arm
p10296
aVThis arm upholds the house of Lancaster
p10297
aVAnd I the house of York
p10298
aVQueen Margaret Prince Edward and Oxford
p10299
aVVouchsafe at our request to stand aside
p10300
aVWhile I use further conference with Warwick
p10301
aVHeavens grant that Warwick\u2019s words bewitch him not
p10302
aVNow Warwick tell me even upon thy conscience
p10303
aVIs Edward your true king For I were loath
p10304
aVTo link with him that were not lawful chosen
p10305
aVThereon I pawn my credit and mine honor
p10306
aVBut is he gracious in the people\u2019s eye
p10307
aVThe more that Henry was unfortunate
p10308
aVThen further all dissembling set aside
p10309
aVTell me for truth the measure of his love
p10310
aVUnto our sister Bona
p10311
aVSuch it seems
p10312
aVAs may beseem a monarch like himself
p10313
aVMyself have often heard him say and swear
p10314
aVThat this his love was an eternal plant
p10315
aVWhereof the root was fixed in virtue\u2019s ground
p10316
aVThe leaves and fruit maintained with beauty\u2019s sun
p10317
aVExempt from envy but not from disdain
p10318
aVUnless the Lady Bona quit his pain
p10319
aVNow sister let us hear your firm resolve
p10320
aVYour grant or your denial shall be mine
p10321
aVSpeaks to Warwick Yet I confess that often ere this day
p10322
aVWhen I have heard your king\u2019s desert recounted
p10323
aVMine ear hath tempted judgment to desire
p10324
aVThen Warwick thus our sister shall be Edward\u2019s
p10325
aVAnd now forthwith shall articles be drawn
p10326
aVTouching the jointure that your king must make
p10327
aVWhich with her dowry shall be counterpoised
p10328
aVDraw near Queen Margaret and be a witness
p10329
aVThat Bona shall be wife to the English king
p10330
aVTo Edward but not to the English king
p10331
aVDeceitful Warwick it was thy device
p10332
aVBy this alliance to make void my suit
p10333
aVBefore thy coming Lewis was Henry\u2019s friend
p10334
aVAnd still is friend to him and Margaret
p10335
aVBut if your title to the crown be weak
p10336
aVAs may appear by Edward\u2019s good success
p10337
aVThen \u2019tis but reason that I be released
p10338
aVFrom giving aid which late I promisèd
p10339
aVYet shall you have all kindness at my hand
p10340
aVThat your estate requires and mine can yield
p10341
aVHenry now lives in Scotland at his ease
p10342
aVWhere having nothing nothing can he lose
p10343
aVAnd as for you yourself our quondam queen
p10344
aVYou have a father able to maintain you
p10345
aVAnd better \u2019twere you troubled him than France
p10346
aVPeace impudent and shameless Warwick
p10347
aVProud setter-up and puller-down of kings
p10348
aVI will not hence till with my talk and tears
p10349
aVBoth full of truth I make King Lewis behold
p10350
aVThy sly conveyance and thy lord\u2019s false love
p10351
aVFor both of you are birds of selfsame feather
p10352
aVWarwick this is some post to us or thee
p10353
aVMy lord ambassador these letters are for you
p10354
aVSent from your brother Marquess Montague
p10355
aVTo Lewis These from our king unto your Majesty
p10356
aVTo Margaret And madam these for you from whom I know not
p10357
aVI like it well that our fair queen and mistress
p10358
aVSmiles at her news while Warwick frowns at his
p10359
aVNay mark how Lewis stamps as he were nettled
p10360
aVI hope all\u2019s for the best
p10361
aVWarwick what are thy news And yours fair queen
p10362
aVMine such as fill my heart with unhoped joys
p10363
aVMine full of sorrow and heart\u2019s discontent
p10364
aVWhat has your king married the Lady Grey
p10365
aVAnd now to soothe your forgery and his
p10366
aVSends me a paper to persuade me patience
p10367
aVIs this th\u2019 alliance that he seeks with France
p10368
aVDare he presume to scorn us in this manner
p10369
aVI told your Majesty as much before
p10370
aVThis proveth Edward\u2019s love and Warwick\u2019s honesty
p10371
aVKing Lewis I here protest in sight of heaven
p10372
aVAnd by the hope I have of heavenly bliss
p10373
aVThat I am clear from this misdeed of Edward\u2019s
p10374
aVNo more my king for he dishonors me
p10375
aVBut most himself if he could see his shame
p10376
aVDid I forget that by the house of York
p10377
aVMy father came untimely to his death
p10378
aVDid I let pass th\u2019 abuse done to my niece
p10379
aVDid I impale him with the regal crown
p10380
aVDid I put Henry from his native right
p10381
aVAnd am I guerdoned at the last with shame
p10382
aVShame on himself for my desert is honor
p10383
aVAnd to repair my honor lost for him
p10384
aVI here renounce him and return to Henry
p10385
aVMy noble queen let former grudges pass
p10386
aVAnd henceforth I am thy true servitor
p10387
aVI will revenge his wrong to Lady Bona
p10388
aVAnd replant Henry in his former state
p10389
aVWarwick these words have turned my hate to love
p10390
aVAnd I forgive and quite forget old faults
p10391
aVAnd joy that thou becom\u2019st King Henry\u2019s friend
p10392
aVSo much his friend ay his unfeignèd friend
p10393
aVThat if King Lewis vouchsafe to furnish us
p10394
aVWith some few bands of chosen soldiers
p10395
aVI\u2019ll undertake to land them on our coast
p10396
aVAnd force the tyrant from his seat by war
p10397
aV\u2019Tis not his new-made bride shall succor him
p10398
aVAnd as for Clarence as my letters tell me
p10399
aVHe\u2019s very likely now to fall from him
p10400
aVFor matching more for wanton lust than honor
p10401
aVOr than for strength and safety of our country
p10402
aVDear brother how shall Bona be revenged
p10403
aVBut by thy help to this distressèd queen
p10404
aVRenownèd prince how shall poor Henry live
p10405
aVUnless thou rescue him from foul despair
p10406
aVMy quarrel and this English queen\u2019s are one
p10407
aVAnd mine fair Lady Bona joins with yours
p10408
aVAnd mine with hers and thine and Margaret\u2019s
p10409
aVTherefore at last I firmly am resolved
p10410
aVYou shall have aid
p10411
aVLet me give humble thanks for all at once
p10412
aVThen England\u2019s messenger return in post
p10413
aVAnd tell false Edward thy supposèd king
p10414
aVThat Lewis of France is sending over maskers
p10415
aVTo revel it with him and his new bride
p10416
aVThou seest what\u2019s passed go fear thy king withal
p10417
aVTell him in hope he\u2019ll prove a widower shortly
p10418
aVI wear the willow garland for his sake
p10419
aVTell him my mourning weeds are laid aside
p10420
aVAnd I am ready to put armor on
p10421
aVTell him from me that he hath done me wrong
p10422
aVAnd therefore I\u2019ll uncrown him ere \u2019t be long
p10423
aVThere\u2019s thy reward
p10424
aVBe gone
p10425
aVBut Warwick
p10426
aVThou and Oxford with five thousand men
p10427
aVShall cross the seas and bid false Edward battle
p10428
aVAnd as occasion serves this noble queen
p10429
aVAnd prince shall follow with a fresh supply
p10430
aVYet ere thou go but answer me one doubt
p10431
aVWhat pledge have we of thy firm loyalty
p10432
aVThis shall assure my constant loyalty
p10433
aVThat if our queen and this young prince agree
p10434
aVI\u2019ll join mine eldest daughter and my joy
p10435
aVTo him forthwith in holy wedlock bands
p10436
aVYes I agree and thank you for your motion
p10437
aVSon Edward she is fair and virtuous
p10438
aVTherefore delay not give thy hand to Warwick
p10439
aVAnd with thy hand thy faith irrevocable
p10440
aVThat only Warwick\u2019s daughter shall be thine
p10441
aVYes I accept her for she well deserves it
p10442
aVAnd here to pledge my vow I give my hand
p10443
aVWhy stay we now These soldiers shall be levied
p10444
aVAnd thou Lord Bourbon our High Admiral
p10445
aVShall waft them over with our royal fleet
p10446
aVI long till Edward fall by war\u2019s mischance
p10447
aVFor mocking marriage with a dame of France
p10448
aVI came from Edward as ambassador
p10449
aVBut I return his sworn and mortal foe
p10450
aVMatter of marriage was the charge he gave me
p10451
aVBut dreadful war shall answer his demand
p10452
aVHad he none else to make a stale but me
p10453
aVThen none but I shall turn his jest to sorrow
p10454
aVI was the chief that raised him to the crown
p10455
aVAnd I\u2019ll be chief to bring him down again
p10456
aVNot that I pity Henry\u2019s misery
p10457
aVBut seek revenge on Edward\u2019s mockery
p10458
aVNow tell me brother Clarence what think you
p10459
aVOf this new marriage with the Lady Grey
p10460
aVHath not our brother made a worthy choice
p10461
aVAlas you know \u2019tis far from hence to France
p10462
aVHow could he stay till Warwick made return
p10463
aVMy lords forbear this talk Here comes the King
p10464
aVAnd his well-chosen bride
p10465
aVI mind to tell him plainly what I think
p10466
aVNow brother of Clarence how like you our choice
p10467
aVThat you stand pensive as half malcontent
p10468
aVAs well as Lewis of France or the Earl of Warwick
p10469
aVWhich are so weak of courage and in judgment
p10470
aVThat they\u2019ll take no offense at our abuse
p10471
aVSuppose they take offense without a cause
p10472
aVThey are but Lewis and Warwick I am Edward
p10473
aVYour king and Warwick\u2019s and must have my will
p10474
aVAnd shall have your will because our king
p10475
aVYet hasty marriage seldom proveth well
p10476
aVYea brother Richard are you offended too
p10477
aVNot I
p10478
aVNo God forbid that I should wish them severed
p10479
aVWhom God hath joined together Ay and \u2019twere pity
p10480
aVTo sunder them that yoke so well together
p10481
aVSetting your scorns and your mislike aside
p10482
aVTell me some reason why the Lady Grey
p10483
aVShould not become my wife and England\u2019s queen
p10484
aVAnd you too Somerset and Montague
p10485
aVSpeak freely what you think
p10486
aVThen this is mine opinion that King Lewis
p10487
aVBecomes your enemy for mocking him
p10488
aVAbout the marriage of the Lady Bona
p10489
aVAnd Warwick doing what you gave in charge
p10490
aVIs now dishonorèd by this new marriage
p10491
aVWhat if both Lewis and Warwick be appeased
p10492
aVBy such invention as I can devise
p10493
aVYet to have joined with France in such alliance
p10494
aVWould more have strengthened this our commonwealth
p10495
aV\u2019Gainst foreign storms than any home-bred marriage
p10496
aVWhy knows not Montague that of itself
p10497
aVEngland is safe if true within itself
p10498
aVBut the safer when \u2019tis backed with France
p10499
aV\u2019Tis better using France than trusting France
p10500
aVLet us be backed with God and with the seas
p10501
aVWhich He hath giv\u2019n for fence impregnable
p10502
aVAnd with their helps only defend ourselves
p10503
aVIn them and in ourselves our safety lies
p10504
aVFor this one speech Lord Hastings well deserves
p10505
aVTo have the heir of the Lord Hungerford
p10506
aVAy what of that It was my will and grant
p10507
aVAnd for this once my will shall stand for law
p10508
aVAnd yet methinks your Grace hath not done well
p10509
aVTo give the heir and daughter of Lord Scales
p10510
aVUnto the brother of your loving bride
p10511
aVShe better would have fitted me or Clarence
p10512
aVBut in your bride you bury brotherhood
p10513
aVOr else you would not have bestowed the heir
p10514
aVOf the Lord Bonville on your new wife\u2019s son
p10515
aVAnd leave your brothers to go speed elsewhere
p10516
aVAlas poor Clarence is it for a wife
p10517
aVThat thou art malcontent I will provide thee
p10518
aVIn choosing for yourself you showed your judgment
p10519
aVWhich being shallow you shall give me leave
p10520
aVTo play the broker in mine own behalf
p10521
aVAnd to that end I shortly mind to leave you
p10522
aVLeave me or tarry Edward will be king
p10523
aVAnd not be tied unto his brother\u2019s will
p10524
aVMy lords before it pleased his Majesty
p10525
aVTo raise my state to title of a queen
p10526
aVDo me but right and you must all confess
p10527
aVThat I was not ignoble of descent
p10528
aVAnd meaner than myself have had like fortune
p10529
aVBut as this title honors me and mine
p10530
aVSo your dislikes to whom I would be pleasing
p10531
aVDoth cloud my joys with danger and with sorrow
p10532
aVMy love forbear to fawn upon their frowns
p10533
aVWhat danger or what sorrow can befall thee
p10534
aVSo long as Edward is thy constant friend
p10535
aVAnd their true sovereign whom they must obey
p10536
aVNay whom they shall obey and love thee too
p10537
aVUnless they seek for hatred at my hands
p10538
aVWhich if they do yet will I keep thee safe
p10539
aVAnd they shall feel the vengeance of my wrath
p10540
aVI hear yet say not much but think the more
p10541
aVNow messenger what letters or what news from France
p10542
aVMy sovereign liege no letters and few words
p10543
aVBut such as I without your special pardon
p10544
aVDare not relate
p10545
aVGo to we pardon thee Therefore in brief
p10546
aVTell me their words as near as thou canst guess them
p10547
aVWhat answer makes King Lewis unto our letters
p10548
aVAt my depart these were his very words
p10549
aVGo tell false Edward the supposèd king
p10550
aVThat Lewis of France is sending over maskers
p10551
aVTo revel it with him and his new bride
p10552
aVIs Lewis so brave Belike he thinks me Henry
p10553
aVBut what said Lady Bona to my marriage
p10554
aVThese were her words uttered with mild disdain
p10555
aVTell him in hope he\u2019ll prove a widower shortly
p10556
aVI\u2019ll wear the willow garland for his sake
p10557
aVI blame not her she could say little less
p10558
aVShe had the wrong But what said Henry\u2019s queen
p10559
aVFor I have heard that she was there in place
p10560
aVTell him quoth she my mourning weeds are done
p10561
aVAnd I am ready to put armor on
p10562
aVBelike she minds to play the Amazon
p10563
aVBut what said Warwick to these injuries
p10564
aVHe more incensed against your Majesty
p10565
aVThan all the rest discharged me with these words
p10566
aVTell him from me that he hath done me wrong
p10567
aVAnd therefore I\u2019ll uncrown him ere \u2019t be long
p10568
aVHa Durst the traitor breathe out so proud words
p10569
aVWell I will arm me being thus forewarned
p10570
aVThey shall have wars and pay for their presumption
p10571
aVBut say is Warwick friends with Margaret
p10572
aVAy gracious sovereign they are so linked in friendship
p10573
aVThat young Prince Edward marries Warwick\u2019s daughter
p10574
aVBelike the elder Clarence will have the younger
p10575
aVNow brother king farewell and sit you fast
p10576
aVFor I will hence to Warwick\u2019s other daughter
p10577
aVThat though I want a kingdom yet in marriage
p10578
aVI may not prove inferior to yourself
p10579
aVYou that love me and Warwick follow me
p10580
aVNot I My thoughts aim at a further matter
p10581
aVI stay not for the love of Edward but the crown
p10582
aVClarence and Somerset both gone to Warwick
p10583
aVYet am I armed against the worst can happen
p10584
aVAnd haste is needful in this desp\u2019rate case
p10585
aVPembroke and Stafford you in our behalf
p10586
aVGo levy men and make prepare for war
p10587
aVThey are already or quickly will be landed
p10588
aVMyself in person will straight follow you
p10589
aVBut ere I go Hastings and Montague
p10590
aVResolve my doubt you twain of all the rest
p10591
aVAre near to Warwick by blood and by alliance
p10592
aVTell me if you love Warwick more than me
p10593
aVIf it be so then both depart to him
p10594
aVI rather wish you foes than hollow friends
p10595
aVBut if you mind to hold your true obedience
p10596
aVGive me assurance with some friendly vow
p10597
aVThat I may never have you in suspect
p10598
aVSo God help Montague as he proves true
p10599
aVAnd Hastings as he favors Edward\u2019s cause
p10600
aVNow brother Richard will you stand by us
p10601
aVAy in despite of all that shall withstand you
p10602
aVWhy so Then am I sure of victory
p10603
aVNow therefore let us hence and lose no hour
p10604
aVTill we meet Warwick with his foreign power
p10605
aVTrust me my lord all hitherto goes well
p10606
aVThe common people by numbers swarm to us
p10607
aVBut see where Somerset and Clarence comes
p10608
aVSpeak suddenly my lords are we all friends
p10609
aVFear not that my lord
p10610
aVThen gentle Clarence welcome unto Warwick
p10611
aVAnd welcome Somerset I hold it cowardice
p10612
aVTo rest mistrustful where a noble heart
p10613
aVHath pawned an open hand in sign of love
p10614
aVElse might I think that Clarence Edward\u2019s brother
p10615
aVWere but a feignèd friend to our proceedings
p10616
aVBut welcome sweet Clarence my daughter shall be thine
p10617
aVAnd now what rests but in night\u2019s coverture
p10618
aVThy brother being carelessly encamped
p10619
aVHis soldiers lurking in the town about
p10620
aVAnd but attended by a simple guard
p10621
aVWe may surprise and take him at our pleasure
p10622
aVOur scouts have found the adventure very easy
p10623
aVThat as Ulysses and stout Diomed
p10624
aVWith sleight and manhood stole to Rhesus\u2019 tents
p10625
aVAnd brought from thence the Thracian fatal steeds
p10626
aVSo we well covered with the night\u2019s black mantle
p10627
aVAt unawares may beat down Edward\u2019s guard
p10628
aVAnd seize himself I say not slaughter him
p10629
aVFor I intend but only to surprise him
p10630
aVYou that will follow me to this attempt
p10631
aVApplaud the name of Henry with your leader
p10632
aVWhy then let\u2019s on our way in silent sort
p10633
aVFor Warwick and his friends God and Saint George
p10634
aVCome on my masters each man take his stand
p10635
aVThe King by this is set him down to sleep
p10636
aVWhat will he not to bed
p10637
aVWhy no for he hath made a solemn vow
p10638
aVNever to lie and take his natural rest
p10639
aVTill Warwick or himself be quite suppressed
p10640
aVTomorrow then belike shall be the day
p10641
aVIf Warwick be so near as men report
p10642
aVBut say I pray what nobleman is that
p10643
aVThat with the King here resteth in his tent
p10644
aV\u2019Tis the Lord Hastings the King\u2019s chiefest friend
p10645
aVO is it so But why commands the King
p10646
aVThat his chief followers lodge in towns about him
p10647
aVWhile he himself keeps in the cold field
p10648
aV\u2019Tis the more honor because more dangerous
p10649
aVAy but give me worship and quietness
p10650
aVI like it better than a dangerous honor
p10651
aVIf Warwick knew in what estate he stands
p10652
aV\u2019Tis to be doubted he would waken him
p10653
aVUnless our halberds did shut up his passage
p10654
aVAy wherefore else guard we his royal tent
p10655
aVBut to defend his person from night foes
p10656
aVThis is his tent and see where stand his guard
p10657
aVCourage my masters Honor now or never
p10658
aVBut follow me and Edward shall be ours
p10659
aVWho goes there
p10660
aVStay or thou diest
p10661
aVWhat are they that fly there
p10662
aVRichard and Hastings
p10663
aVLet them go Here is the Duke
p10664
aVThe Duke
p10665
aVWhy Warwick when we parted thou call\u2019dst me king
p10666
aVAy but the case is altered
p10667
aVWhen you disgraced me in my embassade
p10668
aVThen I degraded you from being king
p10669
aVAnd come now to create you Duke of York
p10670
aVAlas how should you govern any kingdom
p10671
aVThat know not how to use ambassadors
p10672
aVNor how to be contented with one wife
p10673
aVNor how to use your brothers brotherly
p10674
aVNor how to study for the people\u2019s welfare
p10675
aVNor how to shroud yourself from enemies
p10676
aVYea brother of Clarence art thou here too
p10677
aVNay then I see that Edward needs must down
p10678
aVYet Warwick in despite of all mischance
p10679
aVOf thee thyself and all thy complices
p10680
aVEdward will always bear himself as king
p10681
aVThough Fortune\u2019s malice overthrow my state
p10682
aVMy mind exceeds the compass of her wheel
p10683
aVThen for his mind be Edward England\u2019s king
p10684
aVBut Henry now shall wear the English crown
p10685
aVAnd be true king indeed thou but the shadow
p10686
aVMy lord of Somerset at my request
p10687
aVSee that forthwith Duke Edward be conveyed
p10688
aVUnto my brother Archbishop of York
p10689
aVWhen I have fought with Pembroke and his fellows
p10690
aVI\u2019ll follow you and tell what answer
p10691
aVLewis and the Lady Bona send to him
p10692
aVNow for awhile farewell good Duke of York
p10693
aVWhat Fates impose that men must needs abide
p10694
aVIt boots not to resist both wind and tide
p10695
aVWhat now remains my lords for us to do
p10696
aVBut march to London with our soldiers
p10697
aVAy that\u2019s the first thing that we have to do
p10698
aVTo free King Henry from imprisonment
p10699
aVAnd see him seated in the regal throne
p10700
aVMadam what makes you in this sudden change
p10701
aVWhy brother Rivers are you yet to learn
p10702
aVWhat late misfortune is befall\u2019n King Edward
p10703
aVWhat loss of some pitched battle against Warwick
p10704
aVNo but the loss of his own royal person
p10705
aVThen is my sovereign slain
p10706
aVAy almost slain for he is taken prisoner
p10707
aVEither betrayed by falsehood of his guard
p10708
aVOr by his foe surprised at unawares
p10709
aVAnd as I further have to understand
p10710
aVIs new committed to the Bishop of York
p10711
aVFell Warwick\u2019s brother and by that our foe
p10712
aVThese news I must confess are full of grief
p10713
aVYet gracious madam bear it as you may
p10714
aVWarwick may lose that now hath won the day
p10715
aVTill then fair hope must hinder life\u2019s decay
p10716
aVAnd I the rather wean me from despair
p10717
aVFor love of Edward\u2019s offspring in my womb
p10718
aVThis is it that makes me bridle passion
p10719
aVAnd bear with mildness my misfortune\u2019s cross
p10720
aVAy ay for this I draw in many a tear
p10721
aVAnd stop the rising of blood-sucking sighs
p10722
aVLest with my sighs or tears I blast or drown
p10723
aVKing Edward\u2019s fruit true heir to th\u2019 English crown
p10724
aVBut madam where is Warwick then become
p10725
aVI am informèd that he comes towards London
p10726
aVTo set the crown once more on Henry\u2019s head
p10727
aVGuess thou the rest King Edward\u2019s friends must down
p10728
aVBut to prevent the tyrant\u2019s violence
p10729
aVFor trust not him that hath once broken faith
p10730
aVI\u2019ll hence forthwith unto the sanctuary
p10731
aVTo save at least the heir of Edward\u2019s right
p10732
aVThere shall I rest secure from force and fraud
p10733
aVCome therefore let us fly while we may fly
p10734
aVIf Warwick take us we are sure to die
p10735
aVNow my Lord Hastings and Sir William Stanley
p10736
aVLeave off to wonder why I drew you hither
p10737
aVInto this chiefest thicket of the park
p10738
aVThus stands the case you know our king my brother
p10739
aVIs prisoner to the Bishop here at whose hands
p10740
aVHe hath good usage and great liberty
p10741
aVAnd often but attended with weak guard
p10742
aVComes hunting this way to disport himself
p10743
aVI have advertised him by secret means
p10744
aVThat if about this hour he make this way
p10745
aVUnder the color of his usual game
p10746
aVHe shall here find his friends with horse and men
p10747
aVTo set him free from his captivity
p10748
aVThis way my lord for this way lies the game
p10749
aVNay this way man See where the huntsmen stand
p10750
aVNow brother of Gloucester Lord Hastings and the rest
p10751
aVStand you thus close to steal the Bishop\u2019s deer
p10752
aVBrother the time and case requireth haste
p10753
aVYour horse stands ready at the park corner
p10754
aVBut whither shall we then
p10755
aVTo Lynn my lord and shipped from thence to Flanders
p10756
aVWell guessed believe me for that was my meaning
p10757
aVStanley I will requite thy forwardness
p10758
aVBut wherefore stay we \u2019Tis no time to talk
p10759
aVHuntsman what sayst thou Wilt thou go along
p10760
aVBetter do so than tarry and be hanged
p10761
aVCome then away Let\u2019s ha\u2019 no more ado
p10762
aVBishop farewell shield thee from Warwick\u2019s frown
p10763
aVAnd pray that I may repossess the crown
p10764
aVMaster lieutenant now that God and friends
p10765
aVHave shaken Edward from the regal seat
p10766
aVAnd turned my captive state to liberty
p10767
aVMy fear to hope my sorrows unto joys
p10768
aVAt our enlargement what are thy due fees
p10769
aVSubjects may challenge nothing of their sov\u2019reigns
p10770
aVBut if an humble prayer may prevail
p10771
aVI then crave pardon of your Majesty
p10772
aVFor what lieutenant For well using me
p10773
aVNay be thou sure I\u2019ll well requite thy kindness
p10774
aVFor that it made my imprisonment a pleasure
p10775
aVAy such a pleasure as encagèd birds
p10776
aVConceive when after many moody thoughts
p10777
aVAt last by notes of household harmony
p10778
aVThey quite forget their loss of liberty
p10779
aVBut Warwick after God thou sett\u2019st me free
p10780
aVAnd chiefly therefore I thank God and thee
p10781
aVHe was the author thou the instrument
p10782
aVTherefore that I may conquer Fortune\u2019s spite
p10783
aVBy living low where Fortune cannot hurt me
p10784
aVAnd that the people of this blessèd land
p10785
aVMay not be punished with my thwarting stars
p10786
aVWarwick although my head still wear the crown
p10787
aVI here resign my government to thee
p10788
aVFor thou art fortunate in all thy deeds
p10789
aVYour Grace hath still been famed for virtuous
p10790
aVAnd now may seem as wise as virtuous
p10791
aVBy spying and avoiding Fortune\u2019s malice
p10792
aVFor few men rightly temper with the stars
p10793
aVYet in this one thing let me blame your Grace
p10794
aVFor choosing me when Clarence is in place
p10795
aVNo Warwick thou art worthy of the sway
p10796
aVTo whom the heav\u2019ns in thy nativity
p10797
aVAdjudged an olive branch and laurel crown
p10798
aVAs likely to be blest in peace and war
p10799
aVAnd therefore I yield thee my free consent
p10800
aVAnd I choose Clarence only for Protector
p10801
aVWarwick and Clarence give me both your hands
p10802
aVNow join your hands and with your hands your hearts
p10803
aVThat no dissension hinder government
p10804
aVI make you both Protectors of this land
p10805
aVWhile I myself will lead a private life
p10806
aVAnd in devotion spend my latter days
p10807
aVTo sin\u2019s rebuke and my Creator\u2019s praise
p10808
aVWhat answers Clarence to his sovereign\u2019s will
p10809
aVThat he consents if Warwick yield consent
p10810
aVFor on thy fortune I repose myself
p10811
aVWhy then though loath yet must I be content
p10812
aVWe\u2019ll yoke together like a double shadow
p10813
aVTo Henry\u2019s body and supply his place
p10814
aVI mean in bearing weight of government
p10815
aVWhile he enjoys the honor and his ease
p10816
aVAnd Clarence now then it is more than needful
p10817
aVForthwith that Edward be pronounced a traitor
p10818
aVAnd all his lands and goods be confiscate
p10819
aVWhat else And that succession be determinèd
p10820
aVAy therein Clarence shall not want his part
p10821
aVBut with the first of all your chief affairs
p10822
aVLet me entreat for I command no more
p10823
aVThat Margaret your queen and my son Edward
p10824
aVBe sent for to return from France with speed
p10825
aVFor till I see them here by doubtful fear
p10826
aVMy joy of liberty is half eclipsed
p10827
aVIt shall be done my sovereign with all speed
p10828
aVMy lord of Somerset what youth is that
p10829
aVOf whom you seem to have so tender care
p10830
aVMy liege it is young Henry Earl of Richmond
p10831
aVCome hither England\u2019s hope
p10832
aVIf secret powers
p10833
aVSuggest but truth to my divining thoughts
p10834
aVThis pretty lad will prove our country\u2019s bliss
p10835
aVHis looks are full of peaceful majesty
p10836
aVHis head by nature framed to wear a crown
p10837
aVHis hand to wield a scepter and himself
p10838
aVLikely in time to bless a regal throne
p10839
aVMake much of him my lords for this is he
p10840
aVMust help you more than you are hurt by me
p10841
aVWhat news my friend
p10842
aVThat Edward is escapèd from your brother
p10843
aVAnd fled as he hears since to Burgundy
p10844
aVUnsavory news But how made he escape
p10845
aVHe was conveyed by Richard Duke of Gloucester
p10846
aVAnd the Lord Hastings who attended him
p10847
aVIn secret ambush on the forest side
p10848
aVAnd from the Bishop\u2019s huntsmen rescued him
p10849
aVFor hunting was his daily exercise
p10850
aVMy brother was too careless of his charge
p10851
aVBut let us hence my sovereign to provide
p10852
aVA salve for any sore that may betide
p10853
aVMy lord I like not of this flight of Edward\u2019s
p10854
aVFor doubtless Burgundy will yield him help
p10855
aVAnd we shall have more wars before \u2019t be long
p10856
aVAs Henry\u2019s late presaging prophecy
p10857
aVDid glad my heart with hope of this young Richmond
p10858
aVSo doth my heart misgive me in these conflicts
p10859
aVWhat may befall him to his harm and ours
p10860
aVTherefore Lord Oxford to prevent the worst
p10861
aVForthwith we\u2019ll send him hence to Brittany
p10862
aVTill storms be past of civil enmity
p10863
aVAy for if Edward repossess the crown
p10864
aV\u2019Tis like that Richmond with the rest shall down
p10865
aVIt shall be so He shall to Brittany
p10866
aVCome therefore let\u2019s about it speedily
p10867
aVNow brother Richard Lord Hastings and the rest
p10868
aVYet thus far Fortune maketh us amends
p10869
aVAnd says that once more I shall interchange
p10870
aVMy wanèd state for Henry\u2019s regal crown
p10871
aVWell have we passed and now re-passed the seas
p10872
aVAnd brought desirèd help from Burgundy
p10873
aVWhat then remains we being thus arrived
p10874
aVFrom Ravenspurgh Haven before the gates of York
p10875
aVBut that we enter as into our dukedom
p10876
aVThe gates made fast Brother I like not this
p10877
aVFor many men that stumble at the threshold
p10878
aVAre well foretold that danger lurks within
p10879
aVTush man abodements must not now affright us
p10880
aVBy fair or foul means we must enter in
p10881
aVFor hither will our friends repair to us
p10882
aVMy liege I\u2019ll knock once more to summon them
p10883
aVMy lords we were forewarnèd of your coming
p10884
aVAnd shut the gates for safety of ourselves
p10885
aVFor now we owe allegiance unto Henry
p10886
aVBut master mayor if Henry be your king
p10887
aVYet Edward at the least is Duke of York
p10888
aVTrue my good lord I know you for no less
p10889
aVWhy and I challenge nothing but my dukedom
p10890
aVAs being well content with that alone
p10891
aVBut when the fox hath once got in his nose
p10892
aVHe\u2019ll soon find means to make the body follow
p10893
aVWhy master mayor why stand you in a doubt
p10894
aVOpen the gates We are King Henry\u2019s friends
p10895
aVAy say you so The gates shall then be opened
p10896
aVA wise stout captain and soon persuaded
p10897
aVThe good old man would fain that all were well
p10898
aVSo \u2019twere not long of him but being entered
p10899
aVI doubt not I but we shall soon persuade
p10900
aVBoth him and all his brothers unto reason
p10901
aVSo master mayor these gates must not be shut
p10902
aVBut in the night or in the time of war
p10903
aVWhat fear not man but yield me up the keys
p10904
aVFor Edward will defend the town and thee
p10905
aVAnd all those friends that deign to follow me
p10906
aVBrother this is Sir John Montgomery
p10907
aVOur trusty friend unless I be deceived
p10908
aVWelcome Sir John But why come you in arms
p10909
aVTo help King Edward in his time of storm
p10910
aVAs every loyal subject ought to do
p10911
aVThanks good Montgomery But we now forget
p10912
aVOur title to the crown and only claim
p10913
aVOur dukedom till God please to send the rest
p10914
aVThen fare you well for I will hence again
p10915
aVI came to serve a king and not a duke
p10916
aVDrummer strike up and let us march away
p10917
aVNay stay Sir John a while and we\u2019ll debate
p10918
aVBy what safe means the crown may be recovered
p10919
aVWhat talk you of debating In few words
p10920
aVIf you\u2019ll not here proclaim yourself our king
p10921
aVI\u2019ll leave you to your fortune and be gone
p10922
aVTo keep them back that come to succor you
p10923
aVWhy shall we fight if you pretend no title
p10924
aVWhy brother wherefore stand you on nice points
p10925
aVWhen we grow stronger then we\u2019ll make our claim
p10926
aVTill then \u2019tis wisdom to conceal our meaning
p10927
aVAway with scrupulous wit Now arms must rule
p10928
aVAnd fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns
p10929
aVBrother we will proclaim you out of hand
p10930
aVThe bruit thereof will bring you many friends
p10931
aVThen be it as you will for \u2019tis my right
p10932
aVAnd Henry but usurps the diadem
p10933
aVAy now my sovereign speaketh like himself
p10934
aVAnd now will I be Edward\u2019s champion
p10935
aVSound trumpet Edward shall be here proclaimed
p10936
aVCome fellow soldier make thou proclamation
p10937
aVAnd whosoe\u2019er gainsays King Edward\u2019s right
p10938
aVBy this I challenge him to single fight
p10939
aVLong live Edward the Fourth
p10940
aVThanks brave Montgomery and thanks unto you all
p10941
aVIf fortune serve me I\u2019ll requite this kindness
p10942
aVNow for this night let\u2019s harbor here in York
p10943
aVAnd when the morning sun shall raise his car
p10944
aVAbove the border of this horizon
p10945
aVWe\u2019ll forward towards Warwick and his mates
p10946
aVFor well I wot that Henry is no soldier
p10947
aVAh froward Clarence how evil it beseems thee
p10948
aVTo flatter Henry and forsake thy brother
p10949
aVYet as we may we\u2019ll meet both thee and Warwick
p10950
aVCome on brave soldiers doubt not of the day
p10951
aVAnd that once gotten doubt not of large pay
p10952
aVWhat counsel lords Edward from Belgia
p10953
aVWith hasty Germans and blunt Hollanders
p10954
aVHath passed in safety through the Narrow Seas
p10955
aVAnd with his troops doth march amain to London
p10956
aVAnd many giddy people flock to him
p10957
aVLet\u2019s levy men and beat him back again
p10958
aVA little fire is quickly trodden out
p10959
aVWhich being suffered rivers cannot quench
p10960
aVIn Warwickshire I have true-hearted friends
p10961
aVNot mutinous in peace yet bold in war
p10962
aVThose will I muster up and thou son Clarence
p10963
aVShalt stir up in Suffolk Norfolk and in Kent
p10964
aVThe knights and gentlemen to come with thee
p10965
aVThou brother Montague in Buckingham
p10966
aVNorthampton and in Leicestershire shalt find
p10967
aVMen well inclined to hear what thou command\u2019st
p10968
aVAnd thou brave Oxford wondrous well beloved
p10969
aVIn Oxfordshire shalt muster up thy friends
p10970
aVMy sovereign with the loving citizens
p10971
aVLike to his island girt in with the ocean
p10972
aVOr modest Dian circled with her nymphs
p10973
aVShall rest in London till we come to him
p10974
aVFair lords take leave and stand not to reply
p10975
aVFarewell my sovereign
p10976
aVFarewell my Hector and my Troy\u2019s true hope

aVAnd thus I seal my truth and bid adieu
p10981
aVSweet Oxford and my loving Montague
p10982
aVAnd all at once once more a happy farewell
p10983
aVFarewell sweet lords Let\u2019s meet at Coventry
p10984
aVHere at the palace will I rest awhile
p10985
aVCousin of Exeter what thinks your Lordship
p10986
aVMethinks the power that Edward hath in field
p10987
aVShould not be able to encounter mine
p10988
aVThe doubt is that he will seduce the rest
p10989
aVThat\u2019s not my fear My meed hath got me fame
p10990
aVI have not stopped mine ears to their demands
p10991
aVNor posted off their suits with slow delays
p10992
aVMy pity hath been balm to heal their wounds
p10993
aVMy mildness hath allayed their swelling griefs
p10994
aVMy mercy dried their water-flowing tears
p10995
aVI have not been desirous of their wealth
p10996
aVNor much oppressed them with great subsidies
p10997
aVNor forward of revenge though they much erred
p10998
aVThen why should they love Edward more than me
p10999
aVNo Exeter these graces challenge grace
p11000
aVAnd when the lion fawns upon the lamb
p11001
aVThe lamb will never cease to follow him
p11002
aVHark hark my lord what shouts are these
p11003
aVSeize on the shamefaced Henry bear him hence
p11004
aVAnd once again proclaim us King of England
p11005
aVYou are the fount that makes small brooks to flow
p11006
aVNow stops thy spring my sea shall suck them dry
p11007
aVAnd swell so much the higher by their ebb
p11008
aVHence with him to the Tower Let him not speak
p11009
aVAnd lords towards Coventry bend we our course
p11010
aVWhere peremptory Warwick now remains
p11011
aVThe sun shines hot and if we use delay
p11012
aVCold biting winter mars our hoped-for hay
p11013
aVAway betimes before his forces join
p11014
aVAnd take the great-grown traitor unawares
p11015
aVBrave warriors march amain towards Coventry
p11016
aVWhere is the post that came from valiant Oxford
p11017
aVHow far hence is thy lord mine honest fellow
p11018
aVBy this at Dunsmore marching hitherward
p11019
aVHow far off is our brother Montague
p11020
aVWhere is the post that came from Montague
p11021
aVBy this at Daintry with a puissant troop
p11022
aVSay Somerville what says my loving son
p11023
aVAnd by thy guess how nigh is Clarence now
p11024
aVAt Southam I did leave him with his forces
p11025
aVAnd do expect him here some two hours hence
p11026
aVThen Clarence is at hand I hear his drum
p11027
aVIt is not his my lord here Southam lies
p11028
aVThe drum your Honor hears marcheth from Warwick
p11029
aVWho should that be Belike unlooked-for friends
p11030
aVThey are at hand and you shall quickly know
p11031
aVGo Trumpet to the walls and sound a parle
p11032
aVSee how the surly Warwick mans the wall
p11033
aVO unbid spite is sportful Edward come
p11034
aVWhere slept our scouts or how are they seduced
p11035
aVThat we could hear no news of his repair
p11036
aVNow Warwick wilt thou ope the city gates
p11037
aVSpeak gentle words and humbly bend thy knee
p11038
aVCall Edward king and at his hands beg mercy
p11039
aVAnd he shall pardon thee these outrages
p11040
aVNay rather wilt thou draw thy forces hence
p11041
aVConfess who set thee up and plucked thee down
p11042
aVCall Warwick patron and be penitent
p11043
aVAnd thou shalt still remain the Duke of York
p11044
aVI thought at least he would have said the King
p11045
aVOr did he make the jest against his will
p11046
aVIs not a dukedom sir a goodly gift
p11047
aVAy by my faith for a poor earl to give
p11048
aVI\u2019ll do thee service for so good a gift
p11049
aV\u2019Twas I that gave the kingdom to thy brother
p11050
aVWhy then \u2019tis mine if but by Warwick\u2019s gift
p11051
aVThou art no Atlas for so great a weight
p11052
aVAnd weakling Warwick takes his gift again
p11053
aVAnd Henry is my king Warwick his subject
p11054
aVBut Warwick\u2019s king is Edward\u2019s prisoner
p11055
aVAnd gallant Warwick do but answer this
p11056
aVWhat is the body when the head is off
p11057
aVAlas that Warwick had no more forecast
p11058
aVBut whiles he thought to steal the single ten
p11059
aVThe King was slyly fingered from the deck
p11060
aVYou left poor Henry at the Bishop\u2019s palace
p11061
aVAnd ten to one you\u2019ll meet him in the Tower
p11062
aV\u2019Tis even so yet you are Warwick still
p11063
aVCome Warwick take the time kneel down kneel down
p11064
aVNay when Strike now or else the iron cools
p11065
aVI had rather chop this hand off at a blow
p11066
aVAnd with the other fling it at thy face
p11067
aVThan bear so low a sail to strike to thee
p11068
aVSail how thou canst have wind and tide thy friend
p11069
aVThis hand fast wound about thy coal-black hair
p11070
aVShall whiles thy head is warm and new cut off
p11071
aVWrite in the dust this sentence with thy blood
p11072
aVWind-changing Warwick now can change no more
p11073
aVO cheerful colors see where Oxford comes
p11074
aVThe gates are open let us enter too
p11075
aVSo other foes may set upon our backs
p11076
aVStand we in good array for they no doubt
p11077
aVWill issue out again and bid us battle
p11078
aVIf not the city being but of small defense
p11079
aVWe\u2019ll quickly rouse the traitors in the same
p11080
aVO welcome Oxford for we want thy help
p11081
aVThou and thy brother both shall buy this treason
p11082
aVEven with the dearest blood your bodies bear
p11083
aVThe harder matched the greater victory
p11084
aVMy mind presageth happy gain and conquest
p11085
aVTwo of thy name both dukes of Somerset
p11086
aVHave sold their lives unto the house of York
p11087
aVAnd thou shalt be the third if this sword hold
p11088
aVAnd lo where George of Clarence sweeps along
p11089
aVOf force enough to bid his brother battle
p11090
aVWith whom an upright zeal to right prevails
p11091
aVMore than the nature of a brother\u2019s love
p11092
aVCome Clarence come thou wilt if Warwick call
p11093
aVFather of Warwick know you what this means
p11094
aVLook here I throw my infamy at thee
p11095
aVI will not ruinate my father\u2019s house
p11096
aVWho gave his blood to lime the stones together
p11097
aVAnd set up Lancaster Why trowest thou Warwick
p11098
aVThat Clarence is so harsh so blunt unnatural
p11099
aVTo bend the fatal instruments of war
p11100
aVAgainst his brother and his lawful king
p11101
aVPerhaps thou wilt object my holy oath
p11102
aVTo keep that oath were more impiety
p11103
aVThan Jephthah when he sacrificed his daughter
p11104
aVI am so sorry for my trespass made
p11105
aVThat to deserve well at my brother\u2019s hands
p11106
aVI here proclaim myself thy mortal foe
p11107
aVWith resolution wheresoe\u2019er I meet thee
p11108
aVAs I will meet thee if thou stir abroad
p11109
aVTo plague thee for thy foul misleading me
p11110
aVAnd so proud-hearted Warwick I defy thee
p11111
aVAnd to my brother turn my blushing cheeks
p11112
aVPardon me Edward I will make amends
p11113
aVAnd Richard do not frown upon my faults
p11114
aVFor I will henceforth be no more unconstant
p11115
aVNow welcome more and ten times more beloved
p11116
aVThan if thou never hadst deserved our hate
p11117
aVWelcome good Clarence this is brother-like
p11118
aVO passing traitor perjured and unjust
p11119
aVWhat Warwick wilt thou leave the town and fight
p11120
aVOr shall we beat the stones about thine ears
p11121
aVAlas I am not cooped here for defense
p11122
aVI will away towards Barnet presently
p11123
aVAnd bid thee battle Edward if thou dar\u2019st
p11124
aVYes Warwick Edward dares and leads the way
p11125
aVLords to the field Saint George and victory
p11126
aVSo lie thou there Die thou and die our fear
p11127
aVFor Warwick was a bug that feared us all
p11128
aVNow Montague sit fast I seek for thee
p11129
aVThat Warwick\u2019s bones may keep thine company
p11130
aVAh who is nigh Come to me friend or foe
p11131
aVAnd tell me who is victor York or Warwick
p11132
aVWhy ask I that My mangled body shows
p11133
aVMy blood my want of strength my sick heart shows
p11134
aVThat I must yield my body to the earth
p11135
aVAnd by my fall the conquest to my foe
p11136
aVThus yields the cedar to the axe\u2019s edge
p11137
aVWhose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle
p11138
aVUnder whose shade the ramping lion slept
p11139
aVWhose top branch overpeered Jove\u2019s spreading tree
p11140
aVAnd kept low shrubs from winter\u2019s pow\u2019rful wind
p11141
aVThese eyes that now are dimmed with death\u2019s black veil
p11142
aVHave been as piercing as the midday sun
p11143
aVTo search the secret treasons of the world
p11144
aVThe wrinkles in my brows now filled with blood
p11145
aVWere likened oft to kingly sepulchers
p11146
aVFor who lived king but I could dig his grave
p11147
aVAnd who durst smile when Warwick bent his brow
p11148
aVLo now my glory smeared in dust and blood
p11149
aVMy parks my walks my manors that I had
p11150
aVEven now forsake me and of all my lands
p11151
aVIs nothing left me but my body\u2019s length
p11152
aVWhy what is pomp rule reign but earth and dust
p11153
aVAnd live we how we can yet die we must
p11154
aVAh Warwick Warwick wert thou as we are
p11155
aVWe might recover all our loss again
p11156
aVThe Queen from France hath brought a puissant power
p11157
aVEven now we heard the news Ah could\u2019st thou fly
p11158
aVWhy then I would not fly Ah Montague
p11159
aVIf thou be there sweet brother take my hand
p11160
aVAnd with thy lips keep in my soul awhile
p11161
aVThou lov\u2019st me not for brother if thou didst
p11162
aVThy tears would wash this cold congealèd blood
p11163
aVThat glues my lips and will not let me speak
p11164
aVCome quickly Montague or I am dead
p11165
aVAh Warwick Montague hath breathed his last
p11166
aVAnd to the latest gasp cried out for Warwick
p11167
aVAnd said Commend me to my valiant brother
p11168
aVAnd more he would have said and more he spoke
p11169
aVWhich sounded like a cannon in a vault
p11170
aVThat mought not be distinguished but at last
p11171
aVI well might hear delivered with a groan
p11172
aVO farewell Warwick
p11173
aVSweet rest his soul Fly lords and save yourselves
p11174
aVFor Warwick bids you all farewell to meet in heaven
p11175
aVAway away to meet the Queen\u2019s great power
p11176
aVThus far our fortune keeps an upward course
p11177
aVAnd we are graced with wreaths of victory
p11178
aVBut in the midst of this bright-shining day
p11179
aVI spy a black suspicious threat\u2019ning cloud
p11180
aVThat will encounter with our glorious sun
p11181
aVEre he attain his easeful western bed
p11182
aVI mean my lords those powers that the Queen
p11183
aVHath raised in Gallia have arrived our coast
p11184
aVAnd as we hear march on to fight with us
p11185
aVA little gale will soon disperse that cloud
p11186
aVAnd blow it to the source from whence it came
p11187
aVThy very beams will dry those vapors up
p11188
aVFor every cloud engenders not a storm
p11189
aVThe Queen is valued thirty thousand strong
p11190
aVAnd Somerset with Oxford fled to her
p11191
aVIf she have time to breathe be well assured
p11192
aVHer faction will be full as strong as ours
p11193
aVWe are advertised by our loving friends
p11194
aVThat they do hold their course toward Tewkesbury
p11195
aVWe having now the best at Barnet Field
p11196
aVWill thither straight for willingness rids way
p11197
aVAnd as we march our strength will be augmented
p11198
aVIn every county as we go along
p11199
aVStrike up the drum cry Courage and away
p11200
aVGreat lords wise men ne\u2019er sit and wail their loss
p11201
aVBut cheerly seek how to redress their harms
p11202
aVWhat though the mast be now blown overboard
p11203
aVThe cable broke the holding-anchor lost
p11204
aVAnd half our sailors swallowed in the flood
p11205
aVYet lives our pilot still Is \u2019t meet that he
p11206
aVShould leave the helm and like a fearful lad
p11207
aVWith tearful eyes add water to the sea
p11208
aVAnd give more strength to that which hath too much
p11209
aVWhiles in his moan the ship splits on the rock
p11210
aVWhich industry and courage might have saved
p11211
aVAh what a shame ah what a fault were this
p11212
aVSay Warwick was our anchor what of that
p11213
aVAnd Montague our topmast what of him
p11214
aVOur slaughtered friends the tackles what of these
p11215
aVWhy is not Oxford here another anchor
p11216
aVAnd Somerset another goodly mast
p11217
aVThe friends of France our shrouds and tacklings
p11218
aVAnd though unskillful why not Ned and I
p11219
aVFor once allowed the skillful pilot\u2019s charge
p11220
aVWe will not from the helm to sit and weep
p11221
aVBut keep our course though the rough wind say no
p11222
aVFrom shelves and rocks that threaten us with wrack
p11223
aVAs good to chide the waves as speak them fair
p11224
aVAnd what is Edward but a ruthless sea
p11225
aVWhat Clarence but a quicksand of deceit
p11226
aVAnd Richard but a ragged fatal rock
p11227
aVAll these the enemies to our poor bark
p11228
aVSay you can swim alas \u2019tis but awhile
p11229
aVTread on the sand why there you quickly sink
p11230
aVBestride the rock the tide will wash you off
p11231
aVOr else you famish that\u2019s a threefold death
p11232
aVThis speak I lords to let you understand
p11233
aVIf case some one of you would fly from us
p11234
aVThat there\u2019s no hoped-for mercy with the brothers
p11235
aVMore than with ruthless waves with sands and rocks
p11236
aVWhy courage then What cannot be avoided
p11237
aV\u2019Twere childish weakness to lament or fear
p11238
aVMethinks a woman of this valiant spirit
p11239
aVShould if a coward heard her speak these words
p11240
aVInfuse his breast with magnanimity
p11241
aVAnd make him naked foil a man-at-arms
p11242
aVI speak not this as doubting any here
p11243
aVFor did I but suspect a fearful man
p11244
aVHe should have leave to go away betimes
p11245
aVLest in our need he might infect another
p11246
aVAnd make him of like spirit to himself
p11247
aVIf any such be here as God forbid
p11248
aVLet him depart before we need his help
p11249
aVWomen and children of so high a courage
p11250
aVAnd warriors faint Why \u2019twere perpetual shame
p11251
aVO brave young prince thy famous grandfather
p11252
aVDoth live again in thee Long mayst thou live
p11253
aVTo bear his image and renew his glories
p11254
aVAnd he that will not fight for such a hope
p11255
aVGo home to bed and like the owl by day
p11256
aVIf he arise be mocked and wondered at
p11257
aVThanks gentle Somerset Sweet Oxford thanks
p11258
aVAnd take his thanks that yet hath nothing else
p11259
aVPrepare you lords for Edward is at hand
p11260
aVReady to fight Therefore be resolute
p11261
aVI thought no less It is his policy
p11262
aVTo haste thus fast to find us unprovided
p11263
aVBut he\u2019s deceived We are in readiness
p11264
aVThis cheers my heart to see your forwardness
p11265
aVHere pitch our battle hence we will not budge
p11266
aVBrave followers yonder stands the thorny wood
p11267
aVWhich by the heavens\u2019 assistance and your strength
p11268
aVMust by the roots be hewn up yet ere night
p11269
aVI need not add more fuel to your fire
p11270
aVFor well I wot you blaze to burn them out
p11271
aVGive signal to the fight and to it lords
p11272
aVLords knights and gentlemen what I should say
p11273
aVMy tears gainsay for every word I speak
p11274
aVYou see I drink the water of my eye
p11275
aVTherefore no more but this Henry your sovereign
p11276
aVIs prisoner to the foe his state usurped
p11277
aVHis realm a slaughterhouse his subjects slain
p11278
aVHis statutes cancelled and his treasure spent
p11279
aVAnd yonder is the wolf that makes this spoil
p11280
aVYou fight in justice Then in God\u2019s name lords
p11281
aVBe valiant and give signal to the fight
p11282
aVNow here a period of tumultuous broils
p11283
aVAway with Oxford to Hames Castle straight
p11284
aVFor Somerset off with his guilty head
p11285
aVGo bear them hence I will not hear them speak
p11286
aVFor my part I\u2019ll not trouble thee with words
p11287
aVNor I but stoop with patience to my fortune
p11288
aVSo part we sadly in this troublous world
p11289
aVTo meet with joy in sweet Jerusalem
p11290
aVIs proclamation made that who finds Edward
p11291
aVShall have a high reward and he his life
p11292
aVIt is and lo where youthful Edward comes
p11293
aVBring forth the gallant let us hear him speak
p11294
aVWhat can so young a thorn begin to prick
p11295
aVEdward what satisfaction canst thou make
p11296
aVFor bearing arms for stirring up my subjects
p11297
aVAnd all the trouble thou hast turned me to
p11298
aVSpeak like a subject proud ambitious York
p11299
aVSuppose that I am now my father\u2019s mouth
p11300
aVResign thy chair and where I stand kneel thou
p11301
aVWhilst I propose the selfsame words to thee
p11302
aVWhich traitor thou wouldst have me answer to
p11303
aVAh that thy father had been so resolved
p11304
aVThat you might still have worn the petticoat
p11305
aVAnd ne\u2019er have stol\u2019n the breech from Lancaster
p11306
aVLet Aesop fable in a winter\u2019s night
p11307
aVHis currish riddles sorts not with this place
p11308
aVBy heaven brat I\u2019ll plague you for that word
p11309
aVAy thou wast born to be a plague to men
p11310
aVFor God\u2019s sake take away this captive scold
p11311
aVNay take away this scolding crookback rather

aVUntutored lad thou art too malapert

p11315
aVLascivious Edward and thou perjured George
p11316
aVAnd thou misshapen Dick I tell you all

p11318
aVAnd thou usurp\u2019st my father\u2019s right and mine

aVTake that the likeness of this railer here
p11320
aVSprawl\u2019st thou Take that to end thy agony

aVOrphans for their parents\u2019 timeless death
p11414
aVShall rue the hour that ever thou wast born
p11415
aVThe owl shrieked at thy birth an evil sign
p11416
aVThe night-crow cried aboding luckless time
p11417
aVDogs howled and hideous tempest shook down trees
p11418
aVThe raven rooked her on the chimney\u2019s top
p11419
aVAnd chatt\u2019ring pies in dismal discords sung

aVFor this amongst the rest was I ordained
p11430
aVAy and for much more slaughter after this
p11431
aVO God forgive my sins and pardon thee
p11432
aVWhat will the aspiring blood of Lancaster
p11433
aVSink in the ground I thought it would have mounted
p11434
aVSee how my sword weeps for the poor king\u2019s death
p11435
aVO may such purple tears be always shed
p11436
aVFrom those that wish the downfall of our house
p11437
aVIf any spark of life be yet remaining
p11438
aVDown down to hell and say I sent thee thither
p11439
aVI that have neither pity love nor fear
p11440
aVIndeed \u2019tis true that Henry told me of
p11441
aVFor I have often heard my mother say
p11442
aVI came into the world with my legs forward
p11443
aVHad I not reason think you to make haste
p11444
aVAnd seek their ruin that usurped our right
p11445
aVThe midwife wondered and the women cried
p11446
aVO Jesus bless us he is born with teeth
p11447
aVAnd so I was which plainly signified
p11448
aVThat I should snarl and bite and play the dog
p11449
aVThen since the heavens have shaped my body so
p11450
aVLet hell make crook\u2019d my mind to answer it
p11451

aVClarence beware thou keep\u2019st me from the light
p11456
aVBut I will sort a pitchy day for thee
p11457
aVFor I will buzz abroad such prophecies
p11458
aVThat Edward shall be fearful of his life
p11459
aVAnd then to purge his fear I\u2019ll be thy death
p11460
aVKing Henry and the Prince his son are gone
p11461
aVClarence thy turn is next and then the rest
p11462
aVCounting myself but bad till I be best
p11463
aVI\u2019ll throw thy body in another room
p11464
aVAnd triumph Henry in thy day of doom
p11465
aVOnce more we sit in England\u2019s royal throne
p11466
aVRepurchased with the blood of enemies
p11467
aVWhat valiant foemen like to autumn\u2019s corn

aVHave we mowed down in tops of all their pride
p11469
aVThree dukes of Somerset threefold renowned
p11470
aVFor hardy and undoubted champions
p11471
aVTwo Cliffords as the father and the son

aVNe\u2019er spurred their coursers at the trumpet\u2019s sound
p11474
aVWith them the two brave bears Warwick and Montague
p11475
aVThat in their chains fettered the kingly lion
p11476
aVAnd made the forest tremble when they roared

aVCome hither Bess and let me kiss my boy

aVWent all afoot in summer\u2019s scalding heat
p11483
aVThat thou mightst repossess the crown in peace
p11484
aVAnd of our labors thou shalt reap the gain
p11485
aVI\u2019ll blast his harvest if your head were laid
p11486
aVFor yet I am not looked on in the world

aVThis shoulder was ordained so thick to heave

aVAnd heave it shall some weight or break my back

p11506
aVAnd now what rests but that we spend the time
p11507
aVWith stately triumphs mirthful comic shows
p11508
aVSuch as befits the pleasure of the court
p11509
aVSound drums and trumpets Farewell sour annoy
p11510
aVFor here I hope begins our lasting joy
p11511
aVMy liege your Highness now may do me good
p11512
aVMy love is thine to teach Teach it but how
p11513
aVAnd thou shalt see how apt it is to learn
p11514
aVAny hard lesson that may do thee good
p11515
aVHath Leonato any son my lord
p11516
aVNo child but Hero she\u2019s his only heir
p11517
aVDost thou affect her Claudio
p11518
aVO my lord
p11519
aVWhen you went onward on this ended action
p11520
aVI looked upon her with a soldier\u2019s eye
p11521
aVThat liked but had a rougher task in hand
p11522
aVThan to drive liking to the name of love
p11523
aVBut now I am returned and that war thoughts
p11524
aVHave left their places vacant in their rooms
p11525
aVCome thronging soft and delicate desires
p11526
aVAll prompting me how fair young Hero is
p11527
aVSaying I liked her ere I went to wars
p11528
aVThou wilt be like a lover presently
p11529
aVAnd tire the hearer with a book of words
p11530
aVIf thou dost love fair Hero cherish it
p11531
aVAnd I will break with her and with her father
p11532
aVAnd thou shalt have her Was \u2019t not to this end
p11533
aVThat thou began\u2019st to twist so fine a story
p11534
aVHow sweetly you do minister to love
p11535
aVThat know love\u2019s grief by his complexion
p11536
aVBut lest my liking might too sudden seem
p11537
aVI would have salved it with a longer treatise
p11538
aVWhat need the bridge much broader than the flood
p11539
aVThe fairest grant is the necessity
p11540
aVLook what will serve is fit \u2019Tis once thou lovest
p11541
aVAnd I will fit thee with the remedy
p11542
aVI know we shall have reveling tonight
p11543
aVI will assume thy part in some disguise
p11544
aVAnd tell fair Hero I am Claudio
p11545
aVAnd in her bosom I\u2019ll unclasp my heart
p11546
aVAnd take her hearing prisoner with the force
p11547
aVAnd strong encounter of my amorous tale
p11548
aVThen after to her father will I break
p11549
aVAnd the conclusion is she shall be thine
p11550
aVIn practice let us put it presently
p11551
aVThus answer I in name of Benedick
p11552
aVBut hear these ill news with the ears of Claudio
p11553
aV\u2019Tis certain so The Prince woos for himself
p11554
aVFriendship is constant in all other things
p11555
aVSave in the office and affairs of love
p11556
aVTherefore all hearts in love use their own tongues
p11557
aVLet every eye negotiate for itself
p11558
aVAnd trust no agent for beauty is a witch
p11559
aVAgainst whose charms faith melteth into blood
p11560
aVThis is an accident of hourly proof
p11561
aVWhich I mistrusted not Farewell therefore Hero
p11562
aVCome shall we hear this music
p11563
aVYea my good lord How still the evening is
p11564
aVAs hushed on purpose to grace harmony
p11565
aVSee you where Benedick hath hid himself
p11566
aVO very well my lord The music ended
p11567
aVWe\u2019ll fit the kid-fox with a pennyworth
p11568
aVCome Balthasar we\u2019ll hear that song again
p11569
aVO good my lord tax not so bad a voice
p11570
aVTo slander music any more than once
p11571
aVIt is the witness still of excellency
p11572
aVTo put a strange face on his own perfection
p11573
aVI pray thee sing and let me woo no more
p11574
aVBecause you talk of wooing I will sing
p11575
aVSince many a wooer doth commence his suit
p11576
aVTo her he thinks not worthy yet he woos
p11577
aVYet will he swear he loves
p11578
aVNay pray thee come
p11579
aVOr if thou wilt hold longer argument
p11580
aVDo it in notes
p11581
aVNote this before my notes
p11582
aVThere\u2019s not a note of mine that\u2019s worth the noting
p11583
aVWhy these are very crotchets that he speaks
p11584
aVNote notes forsooth and nothing
p11585
aVSigh no more ladies sigh no more
p11586
aVMen were deceivers ever
p11587
aVOne foot in sea and one on shore
p11588
aVTo one thing constant never
p11589
aVThen sigh not so but let them go
p11590
aVAnd be you blithe and bonny
p11591
aVConverting all your sounds of woe
p11592
aVInto Hey nonny nonny
p11593
aVSing no more ditties sing no mo
p11594
aVOf dumps so dull and heavy
p11595
aVThe fraud of men was ever so
p11596
aVSince summer first was leavy
p11597
aVThen sigh not so but let them go
p11598
aVAnd be you blithe and bonny
p11599
aVConverting all your sounds of woe
p11600
aVInto Hey nonny nonny
p11601
aVGood Margaret run thee to the parlor
p11602
aVThere shalt thou find my cousin Beatrice
p11603
aVProposing with the Prince and Claudio
p11604
aVWhisper her ear and tell her I and Ursula
p11605
aVWalk in the orchard and our whole discourse
p11606
aVIs all of her Say that thou overheardst us
p11607
aVAnd bid her steal into the pleachèd bower
p11608
aVWhere honeysuckles ripened by the sun
p11609
aVForbid the sun to enter like favorites
p11610
aVMade proud by princes that advance their pride
p11611
aVAgainst that power that bred it There will she hide her
p11612
aVTo listen our propose This is thy office
p11613
aVBear thee well in it and leave us alone
p11614
aVI\u2019ll make her come I warrant you presently
p11615
aVNow Ursula when Beatrice doth come
p11616
aVAs we do trace this alley up and down
p11617
aVOur talk must only be of Benedick
p11618
aVWhen I do name him let it be thy part
p11619
aVTo praise him more than ever man did merit
p11620
aVMy talk to thee must be how Benedick
p11621
aVIs sick in love with Beatrice Of this matter
p11622
aVIs little Cupid\u2019s crafty arrow made
p11623
aVThat only wounds by hearsay Now begin
p11624
aVFor look where Beatrice like a lapwing runs
p11625
aVClose by the ground to hear our conference
p11626
aVThe pleasant\u2019st angling is to see the fish
p11627
aVCut with her golden oars the silver stream
p11628
aVAnd greedily devour the treacherous bait
p11629
aVSo angle we for Beatrice who even now
p11630
aVIs couchèd in the woodbine coverture
p11631
aVFear you not my part of the dialogue
p11632
aVThen go we near her that her ear lose nothing
p11633
aVOf the false sweet bait that we lay for it
p11634
aVNo truly Ursula she is too disdainful
p11635
aVI know her spirits are as coy and wild
p11636
aVAs haggards of the rock
p11637
aVBut are you sure
p11638
aVThat Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely
p11639
aVSo says the Prince and my new-trothèd lord
p11640
aVAnd did they bid you tell her of it madam
p11641
aVThey did entreat me to acquaint her of it
p11642
aVBut I persuaded them if they loved Benedick
p11643
aVTo wish him wrestle with affection
p11644
aVAnd never to let Beatrice know of it
p11645
aVWhy did you so Doth not the gentleman
p11646
aVDeserve as full as fortunate a bed
p11647
aVAs ever Beatrice shall couch upon
p11648
aVO god of love I know he doth deserve
p11649
aVAs much as may be yielded to a man
p11650
aVBut Nature never framed a woman\u2019s heart
p11651
aVOf prouder stuff than that of Beatrice
p11652
aVDisdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes
p11653
aVMisprizing what they look on and her wit
p11654
aVValues itself so highly that to her
p11655
aVAll matter else seems weak She cannot love
p11656
aVNor take no shape nor project of affection
p11657
aVShe is so self-endeared
p11658
aVSure I think so
p11659
aVAnd therefore certainly it were not good
p11660
aVShe knew his love lest she\u2019ll make sport at it
p11661
aVWhy you speak truth I never yet saw man
p11662
aVHow wise how noble young how rarely featured
p11663
aVBut she would spell him backward If fair-faced
p11664
aVShe would swear the gentleman should be her sister
p11665
aVIf black why Nature drawing of an antic
p11666
aVMade a foul blot if tall a lance ill-headed
p11667
aVIf low an agate very vilely cut
p11668
aVIf speaking why a vane blown with all winds
p11669
aVIf silent why a block moved with none
p11670
aVSo turns she every man the wrong side out
p11671
aVAnd never gives to truth and virtue that
p11672
aVWhich simpleness and merit purchaseth
p11673
aVSure sure such carping is not commendable
p11674
aVNo not to be so odd and from all fashions
p11675
aVAs Beatrice is cannot be commendable
p11676
aVBut who dare tell her so If I should speak
p11677
aVShe would mock me into air O she would laugh me
p11678
aVOut of myself press me to death with wit
p11679
aVTherefore let Benedick like covered fire
p11680
aVConsume away in sighs waste inwardly
p11681
aVIt were a better death than die with mocks
p11682
aVWhich is as bad as die with tickling
p11683
aVYet tell her of it Hear what she will say
p11684
aVNo rather I will go to Benedick
p11685
aVAnd counsel him to fight against his passion
p11686
aVAnd truly I\u2019ll devise some honest slanders
p11687
aVTo stain my cousin with One doth not know
p11688
aVHow much an ill word may empoison liking
p11689
aVO do not do your cousin such a wrong
p11690
aVShe cannot be so much without true judgment
p11691
aVHaving so swift and excellent a wit
p11692
aVAs she is prized to have as to refuse
p11693
aVSo rare a gentleman as Signior Benedick
p11694
aVHe is the only man of Italy
p11695
aVAlways excepted my dear Claudio
p11696
aVI pray you be not angry with me madam
p11697
aVSpeaking my fancy Signior Benedick
p11698
aVFor shape for bearing argument and valor
p11699
aVGoes foremost in report through Italy
p11700
aVIndeed he hath an excellent good name
p11701
aVHis excellence did earn it ere he had it
p11702
aVWhen are you married madam
p11703
aVWhy every day tomorrow Come go in
p11704
aVI\u2019ll show thee some attires and have thy counsel
p11705
aVWhich is the best to furnish me tomorrow
p11706
aVShe\u2019s limed I warrant you We have caught her madam
p11707
aVIf it prove so then loving goes by haps
p11708
aVSome Cupid kills with arrows some with traps
p11709
aVWhat fire is in mine ears Can this be true
p11710
aVStand I condemned for pride and scorn so much
p11711
aVContempt farewell and maiden pride adieu
p11712
aVNo glory lives behind the back of such
p11713
aVAnd Benedick love on I will requite thee
p11714
aVTaming my wild heart to thy loving hand
p11715
aVIf thou dost love my kindness shall incite thee
p11716
aVTo bind our loves up in a holy band
p11717
aVFor others say thou dost deserve and I
p11718
aVBelieve it better than reportingly
p11719
aVStand thee by friar Father by your leave
p11720
aVWill you with free and unconstrainèd soul
p11721
aVGive me this maid your daughter
p11722
aVAs freely son as God did give her me
p11723
aVAnd what have I to give you back whose worth
p11724
aVMay counterpoise this rich and precious gift
p11725
aVNothing unless you render her again
p11726
aVSweet prince you learn me noble thankfulness
p11727
aVThere Leonato take her back again
p11728
aVGive not this rotten orange to your friend
p11729
aVShe\u2019s but the sign and semblance of her honor
p11730
aVBehold how like a maid she blushes here
p11731
aVO what authority and show of truth
p11732
aVCan cunning sin cover itself withal
p11733
aVComes not that blood as modest evidence
p11734
aVTo witness simple virtue Would you not swear
p11735
aVAll you that see her that she were a maid
p11736
aVBy these exterior shows But she is none
p11737
aVShe knows the heat of a luxurious bed
p11738
aVHer blush is guiltiness not modesty
p11739
aVWhat do you mean my lord
p11740
aVNot to be married
p11741
aVNot to knit my soul to an approvèd wanton
p11742
aVDear my lord if you in your own proof
p11743
aVHave vanquished the resistance of her youth
p11744
aVAnd made defeat of her virginity
p11745
aVI know what you would say if I have known her
p11746
aVYou will say she did embrace me as a husband
p11747
aVAnd so extenuate the forehand sin
p11748
aVNo Leonato
p11749
aVI never tempted her with word too large
p11750
aVBut as a brother to his sister showed
p11751
aVBashful sincerity and comely love
p11752
aVAnd seemed I ever otherwise to you
p11753
aVOut on thee seeming I will write against it
p11754
aVYou seem to me as Dian in her orb
p11755
aVAs chaste as is the bud ere it be blown
p11756
aVBut you are more intemperate in your blood
p11757
aVThan Venus or those pampered animals
p11758
aVThat rage in savage sensuality
p11759
aVIs my lord well that he doth speak so wide
p11760
aVSweet prince why speak not you
p11761
aVWhat should I speak
p11762
aVI stand dishonored that have gone about
p11763
aVTo link my dear friend to a common stale
p11764
aVAre these things spoken or do I but dream
p11765
aVSir they are spoken and these things are true
p11766
aVThis looks not like a nuptial
p11767
aVTrue O God

aVIs this the Prince Is this the Prince\u2019s brother

aVLet me but move one question to your daughter
p11773
aVAnd by that fatherly and kindly power
p11774
aVThat you have in her bid her answer truly
p11775
aVI charge thee do so as thou art my child
p11776
aVO God defend me how am I beset
p11777
aVWhat kind of catechizing call you this
p11778
aVTo make you answer truly to your name
p11779
aVIs it not Hero Who can blot that name
p11780
aVWith any just reproach
p11781
aVMarry that can Hero
p11782
aVHero itself can blot out Hero\u2019s virtue
p11783
aVWhat man was he talked with you yesternight

aVOut at your window betwixt twelve and one
p11785
aVNow if you are a maid answer to this

aVI am sorry you must hear Upon mine honor
p11789
aVMyself my brother and this grievèd count
p11790
aVDid see her hear her at that hour last night
p11791
aVTalk with a ruffian at her chamber window
p11792
aVWho hath indeed most like a liberal villain
p11793
aVConfessed the vile encounters they have had
p11794
aVA thousand times in secret
p11795
aVFie fie they are not to be named my lord
p11796
aVNot to be spoke of
p11797
aVThere is not chastity enough in language
p11798
aVWithout offense to utter them Thus pretty lady
p11799
aVI am sorry for thy much misgovernment
p11800
aVO Hero what a Hero hadst thou been
p11801
aVIf half thy outward graces had been placed
p11802
aVAbout thy thoughts and counsels of thy heart
p11803
aVBut fare thee well most foul most fair Farewell

aVThou pure impiety and impious purity
p11805
aVFor thee I\u2019ll lock up all the gates of love
p11806
aVAnd on my eyelids shall conjecture hang
p11807
aVTo turn all beauty into thoughts of harm

aVAnd never shall it more be gracious

aVCry shame upon her Could she here deny
p11825
aVThe story that is printed in her blood
p11826
aVDo not live Hero do not ope thine eyes
p11827
aVFor did I think thou wouldst not quickly die
p11828
aVThought I thy spirits were stronger than thy shames
p11829
aVMyself would on the rearward of reproaches
p11830
aVStrike at thy life Grieved I I had but one
p11831
aVChid I for that at frugal Nature\u2019s frame
p11832
aVO one too much by thee Why had I one
p11833
aVWhy ever wast thou lovely in my eyes
p11834
aVWhy had I not with charitable hand
p11835
aVTook up a beggar\u2019s issue at my gates
p11836
aVWho smirchèd thus and mired with infamy
p11837
aVI might have said No part of it is mine
p11838
aVThis shame derives itself from unknown loins
p11839
aVBut mine and mine I loved and mine I praised
p11840
aVAnd mine that I was proud on mine so much
p11841
aVThat I myself was to myself not mine
p11842
aVValuing of her why she O she is fall\u2019n
p11843
aVInto a pit of ink that the wide sea
p11844
aVHath drops too few to wash her clean again
p11845
aVAnd salt too little which may season give
p11846
aVTo her foul tainted flesh
p11847
aVSir sir be patient
p11848
aVFor my part I am so attired in wonder
p11849
aVI know not what to say
p11850
aVO on my soul my cousin is belied
p11851
aVLady were you her bedfellow last night
p11852
aVNo truly not although until last night
p11853
aVI have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow
p11854
aVConfirmed confirmed O that is stronger made
p11855
aVWhich was before barred up with ribs of iron
p11856
aVWould the two princes lie and Claudio lie
p11857
aVWho loved her so that speaking of her foulness
p11858
aVWashed it with tears Hence from her Let her die
p11859
aVHear me a little
p11860
aVFor I have only silent been so long
p11861
aVAnd given way unto this course of fortune
p11862
aVBy noting of the lady I have marked
p11863
aVA thousand blushing apparitions
p11864
aVTo start into her face a thousand innocent shames
p11865
aVIn angel whiteness beat away those blushes
p11866
aVAnd in her eye there hath appeared a fire
p11867
aVTo burn the errors that these princes hold
p11868
aVAgainst her maiden truth Call me a fool
p11869
aVTrust not my reading nor my observations
p11870
aVWhich with experimental seal doth warrant
p11871
aVThe tenor of my book trust not my age
p11872
aVMy reverence calling nor divinity
p11873
aVIf this sweet lady lie not guiltless here
p11874
aVUnder some biting error
p11875
aVFriar it cannot be
p11876
aVThou seest that all the grace that she hath left
p11877
aVIs that she will not add to her damnation
p11878
aVA sin of perjury She not denies it
p11879
aVWhy seek\u2019st thou then to cover with excuse
p11880
aVThat which appears in proper nakedness
p11881
aVLady what man is he you are accused of
p11882
aVThey know that do accuse me I know none
p11883
aVIf I know more of any man alive
p11884
aVThan that which maiden modesty doth warrant
p11885
aVLet all my sins lack mercy O my father
p11886
aVProve you that any man with me conversed
p11887
aVAt hours unmeet or that I yesternight
p11888
aVMaintained the change of words with any creature
p11889
aVRefuse me hate me torture me to death
p11890
aVThere is some strange misprision in the princes
p11891
aVTwo of them have the very bent of honor
p11892
aVAnd if their wisdoms be misled in this
p11893
aVThe practice of it lives in John the Bastard
p11894
aVWhose spirits toil in frame of villainies
p11895
aVI know not If they speak but truth of her
p11896
aVThese hands shall tear her If they wrong her honor
p11897
aVThe proudest of them shall well hear of it
p11898
aVTime hath not yet so dried this blood of mine
p11899
aVNor age so eat up my invention
p11900
aVNor fortune made such havoc of my means
p11901
aVNor my bad life reft me so much of friends
p11902
aVBut they shall find awaked in such a kind
p11903
aVBoth strength of limb and policy of mind
p11904
aVAbility in means and choice of friends
p11905
aVTo quit me of them throughly
p11906
aVPause awhile
p11907
aVAnd let my counsel sway you in this case
p11908
aVYour daughter here the princes left for dead
p11909
aVLet her awhile be secretly kept in
p11910
aVAnd publish it that she is dead indeed
p11911
aVMaintain a mourning ostentation
p11912
aVAnd on your family\u2019s old monument
p11913
aVHang mournful epitaphs and do all rites
p11914
aVThat appertain unto a burial
p11915
aVWhat shall become of this What will this do
p11916
aVMarry this well carried shall on her behalf
p11917
aVChange slander to remorse That is some good
p11918
aVBut not for that dream I on this strange course
p11919
aVBut on this travail look for greater birth
p11920
aVShe dying as it must be so maintained
p11921
aVUpon the instant that she was accused
p11922
aVShall be lamented pitied and excused
p11923
aVOf every hearer For it so falls out
p11924
aVThat what we have we prize not to the worth
p11925
aVWhiles we enjoy it but being lacked and lost
p11926
aVWhy then we rack the value then we find
p11927
aVThe virtue that possession would not show us
p11928
aVWhiles it was ours So will it fare with Claudio
p11929
aVWhen he shall hear she died upon his words
p11930
aVTh\u2019 idea of her life shall sweetly creep
p11931
aVInto his study of imagination
p11932
aVAnd every lovely organ of her life
p11933
aVShall come appareled in more precious habit
p11934
aVMore moving delicate and full of life
p11935
aVInto the eye and prospect of his soul
p11936
aVThan when she lived indeed Then shall he mourn
p11937
aVIf ever love had interest in his liver
p11938
aVAnd wish he had not so accused her
p11939
aVNo though he thought his accusation true
p11940
aVLet this be so and doubt not but success
p11941
aVWill fashion the event in better shape
p11942
aVThan I can lay it down in likelihood
p11943
aVBut if all aim but this be leveled false
p11944
aVThe supposition of the lady\u2019s death
p11945
aVWill quench the wonder of her infamy
p11946
aVAnd if it sort not well you may conceal her
p11947
aVAs best befits her wounded reputation
p11948
aVIn some reclusive and religious life
p11949
aVOut of all eyes tongues minds and injuries
p11950
aVSignior Leonato let the Friar advise you
p11951
aVAnd though you know my inwardness and love
p11952
aVIs very much unto the Prince and Claudio
p11953
aVYet by mine honor I will deal in this
p11954
aVAs secretly and justly as your soul
p11955
aVShould with your body
p11956
aVBeing that I flow in grief
p11957
aVThe smallest twine may lead me
p11958
aV\u2019Tis well consented Presently away
p11959
aVFor to strange sores strangely they strain the cure
p11960
aVCome lady die to live This wedding day
p11961
aVPerhaps is but prolonged Have patience and endure
p11962
aVIf you go on thus you will kill yourself
p11963
aVAnd \u2019tis not wisdom thus to second grief
p11964
aVAgainst yourself
p11965
aVI pray thee cease thy counsel
p11966
aVWhich falls into mine ears as profitless
p11967
aVAs water in a sieve Give not me counsel
p11968
aVNor let no comforter delight mine ear
p11969
aVBut such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine
p11970
aVBring me a father that so loved his child
p11971
aVWhose joy of her is overwhelmed like mine
p11972
aVAnd bid him speak of patience
p11973
aVMeasure his woe the length and breadth of mine
p11974
aVAnd let it answer every strain for strain
p11975
aVAs thus for thus and such a grief for such
p11976
aVIn every lineament branch shape and form
p11977
aVIf such a one will smile and stroke his beard
p11978
aVBid sorrow wag cry hem when he should groan
p11979
aVPatch grief with proverbs make misfortune drunk
p11980
aVWith candle-wasters bring him yet to me
p11981
aVAnd I of him will gather patience
p11982
aVBut there is no such man For brother men
p11983
aVCan counsel and speak comfort to that grief
p11984
aVWhich they themselves not feel but tasting it
p11985
aVTheir counsel turns to passion which before
p11986
aVWould give preceptial med\u2019cine to rage
p11987
aVFetter strong madness in a silken thread
p11988
aVCharm ache with air and agony with words
p11989
aVNo no \u2019tis all men\u2019s office to speak patience
p11990
aVTo those that wring under the load of sorrow
p11991
aVBut no man\u2019s virtue nor sufficiency
p11992
aVTo be so moral when he shall endure
p11993
aVThe like himself Therefore give me no counsel
p11994
aVMy griefs cry louder than advertisement
p11995
aVTherein do men from children nothing differ
p11996
aVI pray thee peace I will be flesh and blood
p11997
aVFor there was never yet philosopher
p11998
aVThat could endure the toothache patiently
p11999
aVHowever they have writ the style of gods
p12000
aVAnd made a push at chance and sufferance
p12001
aVYet bend not all the harm upon yourself
p12002
aVMake those that do offend you suffer too
p12003
aVThere thou speak\u2019st reason Nay I will do so
p12004
aVMy soul doth tell me Hero is belied
p12005
aVAnd that shall Claudio know so shall the Prince

aVA space for farther travel

p12786
aVThis amorous surfeiter would have donned his helm
p12787
aVFor such a petty war His soldiership
p12788
aVIs twice the other twain But let us rear
p12789
aVThe higher our opinion that our stirring

aVWere \u2019t not that we stand up against them all

aVThe petty difference we yet not know

aVI shall entreat him
p12812
aVTo answer like himself If Caesar move him
p12813
aVLet Antony look over Caesar\u2019s head

aVAnd speak as loud as Mars By Jupiter

aVYour speech is passion but pray you stir

aVShould say myself offended and with you
p12848
aVChiefly i\u2019 th\u2019 world more laughed at that I should

aVYou do mistake your business My brother never
p12862
aVDid urge me in his act I did inquire it
p12863
aVAnd have my learning from some true reports
p12864
aVThat drew their swords with you Did he not rather
p12865
aVDiscredit my authority with yours
p12866
aVAnd make the wars alike against my stomach

p12874
aVNot so not so
p12875
aVI know you could not lack I am certain on \u2019t
p12876
aVVery necessity of this thought that I

aVWhich fronted mine own peace As for my wife

aVThree kings I had newly feasted and did want

p12897
aVAs to have asked him pardon Let this fellow
p12898
aVBe nothing of our strife if we contend
p12899
aVOut of our question wipe him
p12900
aVYou have broken
p12901
aVThe article of your oath which you shall never

p13014
aVWith divers-colored fans whose wind did seem
p13015
aVTo glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool
p13016
aVAnd what they undid did
p13017
aVO rare for Antony
p13018
aVHer gentlewomen like the Nereides

aVSo many mermaids tended her i\u2019 th\u2019 eyes
p13020
aVAnd made their bends adornings At the helm

p14110
aVWill answer as a law
p14111
aVCaesar I go
p14112
aVObserve how Antony becomes his flaw
p14113
aVAnd what thou think\u2019st his very action speaks
p14114
aVIn every power that moves
p14115
aVCaesar I shall
p14116
aVWhat shall we do Enobarbus
p14117
aVThink and die
p14118
aVIs Antony or we in fault for this
p14119
aVAntony only that would make his will
p14120
aVLord of his reason What though you fled
p14121
aVFrom that great face of war whose several ranges
p14122
aVFrighted each other Why should he follow
p14123
aVThe itch of his affection should not then
p14124
aVHave nicked his captainship at such a point
p14125
aVWhen half to half the world opposed he being
p14126
aVThe merèd question \u2019Twas a shame no less
p14127
aVThan was his loss to course your flying flags
p14128
aVAnd leave his navy gazing
p14129
aVPrithee peace
p14130
aVIs that his answer
p14131
aVAy my lord

aVHe says so

aVOf youth upon him from which the world should note
p14142
aVSomething particular his coin ships legions

aVMay be a coward\u2019s whose ministers would prevail
p14144
aVUnder the service of a child as soon
p14145
aVAs i\u2019 th\u2019 command of Caesar I dare him therefore
p14146
aVTo lay his gay caparisons apart
p14147
aVAnd answer me declined sword against sword
p14148
aVOurselves alone I\u2019ll write it Follow me
p14149
aVYes like enough high-battled Caesar will
p14150
aVUnstate his happiness and be staged to th\u2019 show
p14151
aVAgainst a sworder I see men\u2019s judgments are
p14152
aVA parcel of their fortunes and things outward
p14153
aVDo draw the inward quality after them
p14154
aVTo suffer all alike That he should dream
p14155
aVKnowing all measures the full Caesar will
p14156
aVAnswer his emptiness Caesar thou hast subdued
p14157
aVHis judgment too
p14158
aVA messenger from Caesar

aVWhat no more ceremony See my women
p14160
aVAgainst the blown rose may they stop their nose
p14161
aVThat kneeled unto the buds Admit him sir
p14162
aVMine honesty and I begin to square
p14163
aVThe loyalty well held to fools does make
p14164
aVOur faith mere folly Yet he that can endure
p14165
aVTo follow with allegiance a fall\u2019n lord
p14166
aVDoes conquer him that did his master conquer
p14167
aVAnd earns a place i\u2019 th\u2019 story
p14168
aVCaesar\u2019s will
p14169
aVHear it apart
p14170
aVNone but friends Say boldly
p14171
aVSo haply are they friends to Antony
p14172
aVHe needs as many sir as Caesar has
p14173
aVOr needs not us If Caesar please our master
p14174
aVWill leap to be his friend For us you know
p14175
aVWhose he is we are and that is Caesar\u2019s
p14176
aVSo
p14177
aVThus then thou most renowned Caesar entreats
p14178
aVNot to consider in what case thou stand\u2019st
p14179
aVFurther than he is Caesar
p14180
aVGo on right royal
p14181
aVHe knows that you embrace not Antony
p14182
aVAs you did love but as you feared him
p14183
aVO
p14184
aVThe scars upon your honor therefore he
p14185
aVDoes pity as constrainèd blemishes
p14186
aVNot as deserved
p14187
aVHe is a god and knows
p14188
aVWhat is most right Mine honor was not yielded
p14189
aVBut conquered merely
p14190
aVTo be sure of that
p14191
aVI will ask Antony Sir sir thou art so leaky
p14192
aVThat we must leave thee to thy sinking for
p14193
aVThy dearest quit thee
p14194
aVShall I say to Caesar
p14195
aVWhat you require of him For he partly begs
p14196
aVTo be desired to give It much would please him
p14197
aVThat of his fortunes you should make a staff
p14198
aVTo lean upon But it would warm his spirits
p14199
aVTo hear from me you had left Antony
p14200
aVAnd put yourself under his shroud
p14201
aVThe universal landlord
p14202
aVWhat\u2019s your name

p14214
aVMy duty on your hand
p14215
aVYour Caesar\u2019s father oft
p14216
aVWhen he hath mused of taking kingdoms in
p14217
aVBestowed his lips on that unworthy place
p14218
aVAs it rained kisses
p14219
aVFavors By Jove that thunders
p14220
aVWhat art thou fellow
p14221
aVOne that but performs
p14222
aVThe bidding of the fullest man and worthiest
p14223
aVTo have command obeyed
p14224
aVYou will be whipped
p14225
aVApproach there Ah you kite Now gods and devils
p14226
aVAuthority melts from me Of late when I cried Ho
p14227
aVLike boys unto a muss kings would start forth
p14228
aVAnd cry Your will Have you no ears I am
p14229
aVAntony yet
p14230
aVTake hence this jack and whip him
p14231
aV\u2019Tis better playing with a lion\u2019s whelp
p14232
aVThan with an old one dying

aVMoon and stars
p14234
aVWhip him Were \u2019t twenty of the greatest tributaries
p14235
aVThat do acknowledge Caesar should I find them

aVSo saucy with the hand of she here what\u2019s her name

aVTill like a boy you see him cringe his face
p14239
aVAnd whine aloud for mercy Take him hence
p14240
aVMark Antony
p14241
aVTug him away Being whipped
p14242
aVBring him again This jack of Caesar\u2019s shall
p14243
aVBear us an errand to him
p14244
aVTo Cleopatra You were half blasted ere I knew you Ha

aVO is \u2019t come to this
p14257
aVI found you as a morsel cold upon
p14258
aVDead Caesar\u2019s trencher nay you were a fragment
p14259
aVOf Gneius Pompey\u2019s besides what hotter hours
p14260
aVUnregistered in vulgar fame you have
p14261
aVLuxuriously picked out For I am sure
p14262
aVThough you can guess what temperance should be
p14263
aVYou know not what it is
p14264
aVWherefore is this
p14265
aVTo let a fellow that will take rewards
p14266
aVAnd say God quit you be familiar with
p14267
aVMy playfellow your hand this kingly seal
p14268
aVAnd plighter of high hearts O that I were
p14269
aVUpon the hill of Basan to outroar
p14270
aVThe hornèd herd For I have savage cause
p14271
aVAnd to proclaim it civilly were like

aVFor being yare about him
p14274
aVIs he whipped
p14275
aVSoundly my lord

aVCried he And begged he pardon
p14277
aVHe did ask favor
p14278
aVIf that thy father live let him repent
p14279
aVThou wast not made his daughter and be thou sorry
p14280
aVTo follow Caesar in his triumph since

p14286
aVProud and disdainful harping on what I am
p14287
aVNot what he knew I was He makes me angry
p14288
aVAnd at this time most easy \u2019tis to do \u2019t
p14289
aVWhen my good stars that were my former guides
p14290
aVHave empty left their orbs and shot their fires
p14291
aVInto th\u2019 abysm of hell If he mislike
p14292

aVDiscipled of the bravest He lasted long

aVClock to itself knew the true minute when
p15634
aVException bid him speak and at this time
p15635
aVHis tongue obeyed his hand Who were below him

p15637
aVAnd bowed his eminent top to their low ranks
p15638
aVMaking them proud of his humility
p15639
aVIn their poor praise he humbled Such a man

aVI am sure I saw her wear it
p16914
aVYou are deceived my lord She never saw it

aVIn Florence was it from a casement thrown me
p16916
aVWrapped in a paper which contained the name
p16917
aVOf her that threw it Noble she was and thought
p16918
aVI stood ungaged but when I had subscribed
p16919
aVTo mine own fortune and informed her fully
p16920
aVI could not answer in that course of honor
p16921

aVYou got it from her She called the saints to surety
p16932
aVThat she would never put it from her finger
p16933
aVUnless she gave it to yourself in bed
p16934
aVWhere you have never come or sent it us
p16935
aVUpon her great disaster
p16936
aVShe never saw it
p16937

aVHis youngest son and would not change that calling
p17149
aVTo be adopted heir to Frederick

aVAnd here detained by her usurping uncle
p17194
aVTo keep his daughter company whose loves
p17195
aVAre dearer than the natural bond of sisters

aVBut I can tell you that of late this duke

aVHath ta\u2019en displeasure \u2019gainst his gentle niece
p17198

p17199
aVBut that the people praise her for her virtues
p17200

p17201
aVAnd on my life his malice \u2019gainst the lady

p17218
aVIf with myself I hold intelligence
p17219
aVOr have acquaintance with mine own desires
p17220
aVIf that I do not dream or be not frantic
p17221
aVAs I do trust I am not then dear uncle
p17222
aVNever so much as in a thought unborn
p17223
aVDid I offend your Highness
p17224
aVThus do all traitors
p17225
aVIf their purgation did consist in words
p17226
aVThey are as innocent as grace itself
p17227
aVLet it suffice thee that I trust thee not

aVSo was I when your Highness banished him
p17233
aVTreason is not inherited my lord

aVOr if we did derive it from our friends
p17235
aVWhat\u2019s that to me My father was no traitor
p17236
aVThen good my liege mistake me not so much
p17237
aVTo think my poverty is treacherous
p17238
aVDear sovereign hear me speak
p17239
aVAy Celia we stayed her for your sake
p17240
aVElse had she with her father ranged along
p17241
aVI did not then entreat to have her stay
p17242
aVIt was your pleasure and your own remorse
p17243
aVI was too young that time to value her

p17245
aVWhy so am I We still have slept together
p17246
aVRose at an instant learned played eat together

aVShe is too subtle for thee and her smoothness
p17250
aVHer very silence and her patience
p17251
aVSpeak to the people and they pity her
p17252
aVThou art a fool She robs thee of thy name
p17253
aVAnd thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous

p17255
aVFirm and irrevocable is my doom
p17256
aVWhich I have passed upon her She is banished

aVShould in their own confines with forkèd heads
p17338
aVHave their round haunches gored

aVIndeed my lord

aVThe melancholy Jaques grieves at that
p17341
aVAnd in that kind swears you do more usurp

aVThan doth your brother that hath banished you

aVToday my Lord of Amiens and myself
p17344
aVDid steal behind him as he lay along
p17345
aVUnder an oak whose antique root peeps out
p17346
aVUpon the brook that brawls along this wood
p17347
aVTo the which place a poor sequestered stag
p17348
aVThat from the hunter\u2019s aim had ta\u2019en a hurt

aVThat their discharge did stretch his leathern coat
p17352
aVAlmost to bursting and the big round tears
p17353
aVCoursed one another down his innocent nose
p17354
aVIn piteous chase And thus the hairy fool
p17355
aVMuch markèd of the melancholy Jaques
p17356
aVStood on th\u2019 extremest verge of the swift brook
p17357
aVAugmenting it with tears

aVBut what said Jaques
p17359
aVDid he not moralize this spectacle
p17360
aVO yes into a thousand similes
p17361
aVFirst for his weeping into the needless stream
p17362
aVPoor deer quoth he thou mak\u2019st a testament
p17363
aVAs worldlings do giving thy sum of more
p17364
aVTo that which had too much Then being there alone
p17365
aVLeft and abandoned of his velvet friends
p17366
aV\u2019Tis right quoth he Thus misery doth part
p17367
aVThe flux of company Anon a careless herd
p17368
aVFull of the pasture jumps along by him
p17369
aVAnd never stays to greet him Ay quoth Jaques
p17370
aVSweep on you fat and greasy citizens
p17371
aV\u2019Tis just the fashion Wherefore do you look
p17372
aVUpon that poor and broken bankrupt there
p17373
aVThus most invectively he pierceth through
p17374
aVThe body of country city court
p17375
aVYea and of this our life swearing that we
p17376
aVAre mere usurpers tyrants and what\u2019s worse
p17377
aVTo fright the animals and to kill them up
p17378
aVIn their assigned and native dwelling place
p17379
aVAnd did you leave him in this contemplation

aVWe did my lord weeping and commenting
p17381
aVUpon the sobbing deer
p17382
aVShow me the place

aVWhy how now monsieur What a life is this
p17577
aVThat your poor friends must woo your company
p17578
aVWhat you look merrily
p17579
aVA fool a fool I met a fool i\u2019 th\u2019 forest
p17580
aVA motley fool A miserable world
p17581
aVAs I do live by food I met a fool
p17582
aVWho laid him down and basked him in the sun
p17583
aVAnd railed on Lady Fortune in good terms
p17584
aVIn good set terms and yet a motley fool
p17585
aVGood morrow fool quoth I No sir quoth he
p17586
aVCall me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune
p17587
aVAnd then he drew a dial from his poke
p17588
aVAnd looking on it with lack-luster eye
p17589
aVSays very wisely It is ten o\u2019clock
p17590
aVThus we may see quoth he how the world wags
p17591
aV\u2019Tis but an hour ago since it was nine
p17592
aVAnd after one hour more \u2019twill be eleven
p17593
aVAnd so from hour to hour we ripe and ripe
p17594
aVAnd then from hour to hour we rot and rot
p17595
aVAnd thereby hangs a tale When I did hear
p17596
aVThe motley fool thus moral on the time
p17597
aVMy lungs began to crow like chanticleer
p17598
aVThat fools should be so deep-contemplative
p17599
aVAnd I did laugh sans intermission
p17600
aVAn hour by his dial O noble fool
p17601
aVA worthy fool Motley\u2019s the only wear
p17602
aVWhat fool is this

aVO worthy fool One that hath been a courtier
p17604
aVAnd says If ladies be but young and fair
p17605
aVThey have the gift to know it And in his brain
p17606
aVWhich is as dry as the remainder biscuit
p17607
aVAfter a voyage he hath strange places crammed
p17608
aVWith observation the which he vents
p17609
aVIn mangled forms O that I were a fool
p17610
aVI am ambitious for a motley coat
p17611
aVThou shalt have one
p17612
aVIt is my only suit
p17613
aVProvided that you weed your better judgments
p17614
aVOf all opinion that grows rank in them
p17615
aVThat I am wise I must have liberty
p17616
aVWithal as large a charter as the wind
p17617
aVTo blow on whom I please for so fools have
p17618
aVAnd they that are most gallèd with my folly
p17619
aVThey most must laugh And why sir must they so
p17620
aVThe why is plain as way to parish church
p17621
aVHe that a fool doth very wisely hit
p17622
aVDoth very foolishly although he smart
p17623
aVNot to seem senseless of the bob If not
p17624
aVThe wise man\u2019s folly is anatomized

aVTo speak my mind and I will through and through
p17628
aVCleanse the foul body of th\u2019 infected world
p17629
aVIf they will patiently receive my medicine
p17630
aVFie on thee I can tell what thou wouldst do
p17631
aVWhat for a counter would I do but good
p17632
aVMost mischievous foul sin in chiding sin
p17633
aVFor thou thyself hast been a libertine
p17634
aVAs sensual as the brutish sting itself
p17635
aVAnd all th\u2019 embossèd sores and headed evils
p17636
aVThat thou with license of free foot hast caught
p17637
aVWouldst thou disgorge into the general world
p17638
aVWhy who cries out on pride
p17639
aVThat can therein tax any private party
p17640
aVDoth it not flow as hugely as the sea
p17641
aVTill that the weary very means do ebb
p17642
aVWhat woman in the city do I name
p17643
aVWhen that I say the city-woman bears
p17644
aVThe cost of princes on unworthy shoulders
p17645
aVWho can come in and say that I mean her
p17646
aVWhen such a one as she such is her neighbor
p17647
aVOr what is he of basest function
p17648
aVThat says his bravery is not on my cost
p17649
aVThinking that I mean him but therein suits
p17650
aVHis folly to the mettle of my speech
p17651
aVThere then How then what then Let me see wherein
p17652
aVMy tongue hath wronged him If it do him right
p17653
aVThen he hath wronged himself If he be free
p17654
aVWhy then my taxing like a wild goose flies
p17655
aVUnclaimed of any man
p17656
aVBut who comes here
p17657
aVForbear and eat no more
p17658
aVWhy I have eat none yet
p17659
aVNor shalt not till necessity be served
p17660
aVArt thou thus boldened man by thy distress
p17661
aVOr else a rude despiser of good manners
p17662
aVThat in civility thou seem\u2019st so empty
p17663
aVYou touched my vein at first The thorny point
p17664
aVOf bare distress hath ta\u2019en from me the show
p17665
aVOf smooth civility yet am I inland bred
p17666
aVAnd know some nurture But forbear I say
p17667
aVHe dies that touches any of this fruit
p17668
aVTill I and my affairs are answerèd
p17669
aVWhat would you have Your gentleness shall force
p17670
aVMore than your force move us to gentleness
p17671
aVI almost die for food and let me have it
p17672
aVSit down and feed and welcome to our table
p17673
aVSpeak you so gently Pardon me I pray you
p17674
aVI thought that all things had been savage here
p17675
aVAnd therefore put I on the countenance
p17676
aVOf stern commandment But whate\u2019er you are
p17677
aVThat in this desert inaccessible
p17678
aVUnder the shade of melancholy boughs
p17679
aVLose and neglect the creeping hours of time
p17680
aVIf ever you have looked on better days
p17681
aVIf ever been where bells have knolled to church
p17682
aVIf ever sat at any good man\u2019s feast
p17683
aVIf ever from your eyelids wiped a tear
p17684
aVAnd know what \u2019tis to pity and be pitied
p17685
aVLet gentleness my strong enforcement be
p17686
aVIn the which hope I blush and hide my sword
p17687
aVTrue is it that we have seen better days
p17688
aVAnd have with holy bell been knolled to church
p17689
aVAnd sat at good men\u2019s feasts and wiped our eyes
p17690
aVOf drops that sacred pity hath engendered
p17691
aVAnd therefore sit you down in gentleness
p17692
aVAnd take upon command what help we have
p17693
aVThat to your wanting may be ministered
p17694
aVThen but forbear your food a little while
p17695
aVWhiles like a doe I go to find my fawn
p17696
aVAnd give it food There is an old poor man
p17697
aVWho after me hath many a weary step
p17698
aVLimped in pure love Till he be first sufficed
p17699
aVOppressed with two weak evils age and hunger
p17700
aVI will not touch a bit
p17701
aVGo find him out
p17702
aVAnd we will nothing waste till you return
p17703
aVI thank you and be blessed for your good comfort
p17704
aVThou seest we are not all alone unhappy
p17705
aVThis wide and universal theater
p17706
aVPresents more woeful pageants than the scene
p17707
aVWherein we play in
p17708
aVAll the world\u2019s a stage
p17709
aVAnd all the men and women merely players
p17710
aVThey have their exits and their entrances
p17711
aVAnd one man in his time plays many parts
p17712
aVHis acts being seven ages At first the infant
p17713
aVMewling and puking in the nurse\u2019s arms
p17714
aVThen the whining schoolboy with his satchel
p17715
aVAnd shining morning face creeping like snail
p17716
aVUnwillingly to school And then the lover
p17717
aVSighing like furnace with a woeful ballad
p17718
aVMade to his mistress\u2019 eyebrow Then a soldier
p17719
aVFull of strange oaths and bearded like the pard
p17720
aVJealous in honor sudden and quick in quarrel
p17721
aVSeeking the bubble reputation
p17722
aVEven in the cannon\u2019s mouth And then the justice
p17723
aVIn fair round belly with good capon lined
p17724
aVWith eyes severe and beard of formal cut
p17725
aVFull of wise saws and modern instances
p17726
aVAnd so he plays his part The sixth age shifts
p17727
aVInto the lean and slippered pantaloon
p17728
aVWith spectacles on nose and pouch on side
p17729
aVHis youthful hose well saved a world too wide
p17730
aVFor his shrunk shank and his big manly voice
p17731
aVTurning again toward childish treble pipes
p17732
aVAnd whistles in his sound Last scene of all
p17733
aVThat ends this strange eventful history
p17734
aVIs second childishness and mere oblivion
p17735
aVSans teeth sans eyes sans taste sans everything
p17736
aVWelcome Set down your venerable burden
p17737
aVAnd let him feed
p17738
aVI thank you most for him
p17739
aVSo had you need

aVThou art not so unkind
p17746
aVAs man\u2019s ingratitude

aVAs friend remembered not
p17760
aVHeigh-ho sing heigh-ho unto the green holly
p17761
aVMost friendship is feigning most loving mere folly

aVPraising the proud disdainful shepherdess
p17862
aVThat was his mistress
p17863
aVWell and what of him
p17864
aVIf you will see a pageant truly played
p17865
aVBetween the pale complexion of true love
p17866
aVAnd the red glow of scorn and proud disdain
p17867
aVGo hence a little and I shall conduct you

aVIn bitterness The common executioner

aVThan he that dies and lives by bloody drops
p17880
aVI would not be thy executioner
p17881
aVI fly thee for I would not injure thee
p17882
aVThou tell\u2019st me there is murder in mine eye
p17883
aV\u2019Tis pretty sure and very probable
p17884
aVThat eyes that are the frail\u2019st and softest things
p17885
aVWho shut their coward gates on atomies
p17886
aVShould be called tyrants butchers murderers

aVO dear Phoebe

aVIf ever as that ever may be near
p17902
aVYou meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy
p17903
aVThen shall you know the wounds invisible
p17904
aVThat love\u2019s keen arrows make
p17905
aVBut till that time

aVOver the wretched What though you have no beauty
p17912
aVAs by my faith I see no more in you

aVThan without candle may go dark to bed
p17914
aVMust you be therefore proud and pitiless

aVI think she means to tangle my eyes too
p17919
aVNo faith proud mistress hope not after it
p17920
aV\u2019Tis not your inky brows your black silk hair
p17921
aVYour bugle eyeballs nor your cheek of cream
p17922
aVThat can entame my spirits to your worship
p17923
aVYou foolish shepherd wherefore do you follow her
p17924
aVLike foggy south puffing with wind and rain
p17925
aVYou are a thousand times a properer man
p17926
aVThan she a woman \u2019Tis such fools as you
p17927
aVThat makes the world full of ill-favored children
p17928
aV\u2019Tis not her glass but you that flatters her
p17929
aVAnd out of you she sees herself more proper
p17930
aVThan any of her lineaments can show her
p17931
aVBut mistress know yourself Down on your knees
p17932
aVAnd thank heaven fasting for a good man\u2019s love
p17933
aVFor I must tell you friendly in your ear
p17934
aVSell when you can you are not for all markets

aVCry the man mercy love him take his offer

aVSo take her to thee shepherd Fare you well
p17938
aVSweet youth I pray you chide a year together
p17939
aVI had rather hear you chide than this man woo
p17940
aVFor no ill will I bear you
p17941
aVI pray you do not fall in love with me
p17942
aVFor I am falser than vows made in wine
p17943
aVBesides I like you not If you will know my house
p17944
aV\u2019Tis at the tuft of olives here hard by

aVCome to our flock
p17950
aVDead shepherd now I find thy saw of might
p17951
aVWho ever loved that loved not at first sight
p17952
aVSweet Phoebe
p17953
aVHa what sayst thou Silvius
p17954
aVSweet Phoebe pity me
p17955
aVWhy I am sorry for thee gentle Silvius
p17956
aVWherever sorrow is relief would be
p17957
aVIf you do sorrow at my grief in love
p17958
aVBy giving love your sorrow and my grief
p17959
aVWere both extermined
p17960
aVThou hast my love Is not that neighborly
p17961
aVI would have you
p17962
aVWhy that were covetousness
p17963
aVSilvius the time was that I hated thee
p17964
aVAnd yet it is not that I bear thee love
p17965
aVBut since that thou canst talk of love so well
p17966
aVThy company which erst was irksome to me
p17967
aVI will endure and I\u2019ll employ thee too
p17968
aVBut do not look for further recompense
p17969
aVThan thine own gladness that thou art employed
p17970
aVSo holy and so perfect is my love
p17971
aVAnd I in such a poverty of grace
p17972
aVThat I shall think it a most plenteous crop
p17973
aVTo glean the broken ears after the man
p17974
aVThat the main harvest reaps Loose now and then
p17975
aVA scattered smile and that I\u2019ll live upon
p17976
aVKnow\u2019st thou the youth that spoke to me erewhile
p17977
aVNot very well but I have met him oft
p17978
aVAnd he hath bought the cottage and the bounds
p17979
aVThat the old carlot once was master of
p17980
aVThink not I love him though I ask for him
p17981
aV\u2019Tis but a peevish boy yet he talks well
p17982
aVBut what care I for words Yet words do well
p17983
aVWhen he that speaks them pleases those that hear
p17984
aVIt is a pretty youth not very pretty
p17985
aVBut sure he\u2019s proud and yet his pride becomes him
p17986
aVHe\u2019ll make a proper man The best thing in him
p17987
aVIs his complexion and faster than his tongue
p17988
aVDid make offense his eye did heal it up
p17989
aVHe is not very tall yet for his years he\u2019s tall
p17990
aVHis leg is but so-so and yet \u2019tis well
p17991
aVThere was a pretty redness in his lip
p17992
aVA little riper and more lusty red
p17993
aVThan that mixed in his cheek \u2019twas just the difference
p17994
aVBetwixt the constant red and mingled damask
p17995
aVThere be some women Silvius had they marked him
p17996
aVIn parcels as I did would have gone near
p17997
aVTo fall in love with him but for my part
p17998
aVI love him not nor hate him not and yet
p17999
aVI have more cause to hate him than to love him
p18000
aVFor what had he to do to chide at me
p18001
aVHe said mine eyes were black and my hair black
p18002
aVAnd now I am remembered scorned at me
p18003
aVI marvel why I answered not again
p18004
aVBut that\u2019s all one omittance is no quittance
p18005
aVI\u2019ll write to him a very taunting letter
p18006
aVAnd thou shalt bear it Wilt thou Silvius
p18007
aVPhoebe with all my heart
p18008
aVI\u2019ll write it straight
p18009
aVThe matter\u2019s in my head and in my heart
p18010
aVI will be bitter with him and passing short
p18011
aVGo with me Silvius
p18012
aVGood day and happiness dear Rosalind
p18013
aVWhat shall he have that killed the deer
p18014
aVHis leather skin and horns to wear
p18015
aVThen sing him home
p18016
aVTake thou no scorn to wear the horn
p18017
aVIt was a crest ere thou wast born
p18018
aVThy father\u2019s father wore it
p18019
aVAnd thy father bore it
p18020
aVThe horn the horn the lusty horn
p18021
aVIs not a thing to laugh to scorn
p18022
aVMy errand is to you fair youth
p18023
aVMy gentle Phoebe did bid me give you this
p18024
aVI know not the contents but as I guess
p18025
aVBy the stern brow and waspish action
p18026
aVWhich she did use as she was writing of it
p18027
aVIt bears an angry tenor Pardon me
p18028
aVI am but as a guiltless messenger
p18029
aVPatience herself would startle at this letter
p18030
aVAnd play the swaggerer Bear this bear all
p18031
aVShe says I am not fair that I lack manners
p18032
aVShe calls me proud and that she could not love me
p18033
aVWere man as rare as phoenix \u2019Od\u2019s my will
p18034
aVHer love is not the hare that I do hunt
p18035
aVWhy writes she so to me Well shepherd well
p18036
aVThis is a letter of your own device
p18037
aVNo I protest I know not the contents
p18038
aVPhoebe did write it
p18039
aVCome come you are a fool
p18040
aVAnd turned into the extremity of love
p18041
aVI saw her hand She has a leathern hand
p18042
aVA freestone-colored hand I verily did think
p18043
aVThat her old gloves were on but \u2019twas her hands
p18044
aVShe has a huswife\u2019s hand but that\u2019s no matter
p18045

p18046
aVThis is a man\u2019s invention and his hand
p18047
aVSure it is hers
p18048
aVWhy \u2019tis a boisterous and a cruel style
p18049
aVA style for challengers Why she defies me
p18050
aVLike Turk to Christian Women\u2019s gentle brain
p18051
aVCould not drop forth such giant-rude invention
p18052
aVSuch Ethiop words blacker in their effect
p18053
aVThan in their countenance Will you hear the letter
p18054
aVSo please you for I never heard it yet
p18055
aVYet heard too much of Phoebe\u2019s cruelty
p18056
aVShe Phoebes me Mark how the tyrant writes
p18057
aVArt thou god to shepherd turned
p18058
aVThat a maiden\u2019s heart hath burned
p18059
aVWhy thy godhead laid apart
p18060
aVWarr\u2019st thou with a woman\u2019s heart
p18061
aVWhiles the eye of man did woo me
p18062
aVThat could do no vengeance to me
p18063
aVIf the scorn of your bright eyne
p18064
aVHave power to raise such love in mine
p18065
aVAlack in me what strange effect
p18066
aVWould they work in mild aspect
p18067
aVWhiles you chid me I did love
p18068
aVHow then might your prayers move
p18069
aVHe that brings this love to thee
p18070
aVLittle knows this love in me
p18071
aVAnd by him seal up thy mind
p18072
aVWhether that thy youth and kind
p18073
aVWill the faithful offer take
p18074
aVOf me and all that I can make
p18075
aVOr else by him my love deny
p18076
aVAnd then I\u2019ll study how to die
p18077
aVGood morrow fair ones Pray you if you know
p18078
aVWhere in the purlieus of this forest stands
p18079
aVA sheepcote fenced about with olive trees
p18080
aVWest of this place down in the neighbor bottom
p18081
aVThe rank of osiers by the murmuring stream
p18082
aVLeft on your right hand brings you to the place
p18083
aVBut at this hour the house doth keep itself
p18084
aVThere\u2019s none within
p18085
aVIf that an eye may profit by a tongue
p18086
aVThen should I know you by description
p18087
aVSuch garments and such years The boy is fair
p18088
aVOf female favor and bestows himself
p18089
aVLike a ripe sister the woman low
p18090
aVAnd browner than her brother Are not you
p18091
aVThe owner of the house I did inquire for
p18092
aVIt is no boast being asked to say we are
p18093
aVOrlando doth commend him to you both
p18094
aVAnd to that youth he calls his Rosalind
p18095
aVHe sends this bloody napkin Are you he
p18096
aVI am What must we understand by this
p18097
aVSome of my shame if you will know of me
p18098
aVWhat man I am and how and why and where
p18099
aVThis handkercher was stained
p18100
aVI pray you tell it
p18101
aVWhen last the young Orlando parted from you
p18102
aVHe left a promise to return again
p18103
aVWithin an hour and pacing through the forest
p18104
aVChewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy
p18105
aVLo what befell He threw his eye aside
p18106
aVAnd mark what object did present itself
p18107
aVUnder an old oak whose boughs were mossed with age
p18108
aVAnd high top bald with dry antiquity
p18109
aVA wretched ragged man o\u2019ergrown with hair
p18110
aVLay sleeping on his back About his neck
p18111
aVA green and gilded snake had wreathed itself
p18112
aVWho with her head nimble in threats approached
p18113
aVThe opening of his mouth But suddenly
p18114
aVSeeing Orlando it unlinked itself
p18115
aVAnd with indented glides did slip away
p18116
aVInto a bush under which bush\u2019s shade
p18117
aVA lioness with udders all drawn dry
p18118
aVLay couching head on ground with catlike watch
p18119
aVWhen that the sleeping man should stir for \u2019tis
p18120
aVThe royal disposition of that beast
p18121
aVTo prey on nothing that doth seem as dead
p18122
aVThis seen Orlando did approach the man
p18123
aVAnd found it was his brother his elder brother
p18124
aVO I have heard him speak of that same brother
p18125
aVAnd he did render him the most unnatural
p18126
aVThat lived amongst men
p18127
aVAnd well he might so do
p18128
aVFor well I know he was unnatural
p18129
aVBut to Orlando did he leave him there
p18130
aVFood to the sucked and hungry lioness
p18131
aVTwice did he turn his back and purposed so
p18132
aVBut kindness nobler ever than revenge
p18133
aVAnd nature stronger than his just occasion
p18134
aVMade him give battle to the lioness
p18135
aVWho quickly fell before him in which hurtling
p18136
aVFrom miserable slumber I awaked
p18137
aVAre you his brother
p18138
aVWas \u2019t you he rescued
p18139
aVWas \u2019t you that did so oft contrive to kill him
p18140
aV\u2019Twas I but \u2019tis not I I do not shame
p18141
aVTo tell you what I was since my conversion
p18142
aVSo sweetly tastes being the thing I am
p18143
aVBut for the bloody napkin
p18144
aVBy and by
p18145
aVWhen from the first to last betwixt us two
p18146
aVTears our recountments had most kindly bathed
p18147
aVAs how I came into that desert place
p18148
aVIn brief he led me to the gentle duke
p18149
aVWho gave me fresh array and entertainment
p18150
aVCommitting me unto my brother\u2019s love
p18151
aVWho led me instantly unto his cave
p18152
aVThere stripped himself and here upon his arm
p18153
aVThe lioness had torn some flesh away
p18154
aVWhich all this while had bled and now he fainted
p18155
aVAnd cried in fainting upon Rosalind
p18156
aVBrief I recovered him bound up his wound
p18157
aVAnd after some small space being strong at heart
p18158
aVHe sent me hither stranger as I am
p18159
aVTo tell this story that you might excuse
p18160
aVHis broken promise and to give this napkin
p18161
aVDyed in his blood unto the shepherd youth
p18162
aVThat he in sport doth call his Rosalind
p18163
aVWhy how now Ganymede sweet Ganymede
p18164
aVMany will swoon when they do look on blood
p18165

p18167
aVHow you excuse my brother Rosalind

p18466
aVYou cry against the noble senate who
p18467

aVThey vented their complainings which being answered
p18492
aVAnd a petition granted them a strange one
p18493
aVTo break the heart of generosity
p18494
aVAnd make bold power look pale they threw their caps
p18495
aVAs they would hang them on the horns o\u2019 th\u2019 moon

aVHere What\u2019s the matter
p18509
aVThe news is sir the Volsces are in arms
p18510
aVI am glad on \u2019t Then we shall ha\u2019 means to vent
p18511
aVOur musty superfluity
p18512
aVSee our best elders
p18513
aVMartius \u2019tis true that you have lately told us
p18514
aVThe Volsces are in arms
p18515
aVThey have a leader
p18516
aVTullus Aufidius that will put you to \u2019t
p18517
aVI sin in envying his nobility
p18518
aVAnd were I anything but what I am
p18519
aVI would wish me only he

aVYou have fought together
p18521
aVWere half to half the world by th\u2019 ears and he
p18522
aVUpon my party I\u2019d revolt to make
p18523
aVOnly my wars with him He is a lion
p18524
aVThat I am proud to hunt
p18525
aVThen worthy Martius
p18526
aVAttend upon Cominius to these wars
p18527
aVIt is your former promise
p18528
aVSir it is
p18529
aVAnd I am constant Titus Lartius thou

aVShalt see me once more strike at Tullus\u2019 face
p18531
aVWhat art thou stiff Stand\u2019st out
p18532
aVNo Caius Martius
p18533
aVI\u2019ll lean upon one crutch and fight with t\u2019 other
p18534
aVEre stay behind this business
p18535
aVO true bred

aVTo Martius Follow Cominius We must follow you
p18540
aVRight worthy you priority
p18541
aVNoble Martius
p18542
aVHence to your homes begone
p18543
aVNay let them follow
p18544
aVThe Volsces have much corn take these rats thither
p18545
aVTo gnaw their garners
p18546
aVWorshipful mutineers
p18547
aVYour valor puts well forth Pray follow
p18548
aVWas ever man so proud as is this Martius
p18549
aVHe has no equal
p18550
aVWhen we were chosen tribunes for the people
p18551
aVMarked you his lip and eyes
p18552
aVNay but his taunts
p18553
aVBeing moved he will not spare to gird the gods
p18554
aVBemock the modest moon
p18555
aVThe present wars devour him He is grown
p18556
aVToo proud to be so valiant
p18557
aVSuch a nature
p18558
aVTickled with good success disdains the shadow
p18559
aVWhich he treads on at noon But I do wonder
p18560
aVHis insolence can brook to be commanded
p18561
aVUnder Cominius
p18562
aVFame at the which he aims
p18563
aVIn whom already he\u2019s well graced cannot
p18564
aVBetter be held nor more attained than by
p18565
aVA place below the first for what miscarries
p18566
aVShall be the General\u2019s fault though he perform
p18567
aVTo th\u2019 utmost of a man and giddy censure
p18568
aVWill then cry out of Martius O if he
p18569
aVHad borne the business
p18570
aVBesides if things go well
p18571
aVOpinion that so sticks on Martius shall
p18572
aVOf his demerits rob Cominius
p18573
aVCome
p18574
aVHalf all Cominius\u2019 honors are to Martius
p18575
aVThough Martius earned them not and all his faults
p18576
aVTo Martius shall be honors though indeed
p18577
aVIn aught he merit not
p18578
aVLet\u2019s hence and hear
p18579
aVHow the dispatch is made and in what fashion
p18580
aVMore than his singularity he goes
p18581
aVUpon this present action
p18582
aVLet\u2019s along
p18583
aVSo your opinion is Aufidius
p18584
aVThat they of Rome are entered in our counsels
p18585
aVAnd know how we proceed
p18586
aVIs it not yours
p18587
aVWhatever have been thought on in this state
p18588
aVThat could be brought to bodily act ere Rome
p18589
aVHad circumvention \u2019Tis not four days gone
p18590
aVSince I heard thence These are the words I think
p18591
aVI have the letter here Yes here it is
p18592
aVThey have pressed a power but it is not known
p18593
aVWhether for east or west The dearth is great
p18594
aVThe people mutinous and it is rumored
p18595
aVCominius Martius your old enemy
p18596
aVWho is of Rome worse hated than of you
p18597
aVAnd Titus Lartius a most valiant Roman
p18598
aVThese three lead on this preparation
p18599
aVWhither \u2019tis bent Most likely \u2019tis for you
p18600
aVConsider of it
p18601
aVOur army\u2019s in the field
p18602
aVWe never yet made doubt but Rome was ready
p18603
aVTo answer us
p18604
aVNor did you think it folly
p18605
aVTo keep your great pretenses veiled till when
p18606
aVThey needs must show themselves which in the hatching
p18607
aVIt seemed appeared to Rome By the discovery
p18608
aVWe shall be shortened in our aim which was
p18609
aVTo take in many towns ere almost Rome
p18610
aVShould know we were afoot
p18611
aVNoble Aufidius
p18612
aVTake your commission hie you to your bands
p18613
aVLet us alone to guard Corioles
p18614
aVIf they set down before \u2019s for the remove
p18615
aVBring up your army But I think you\u2019ll find
p18616
aVThey\u2019ve not prepared for us
p18617
aVO doubt not that
p18618
aVI speak from certainties Nay more
p18619
aVSome parcels of their power are forth already
p18620
aVAnd only hitherward I leave your Honors
p18621
aVIf we and Caius Martius chance to meet
p18622
aV\u2019Tis sworn between us we shall ever strike
p18623
aVTill one can do no more

aVThe gods assist you

p18629
aVBeseech you give me leave to retire myself
p18630
aVIndeed you shall not
p18631
aVMethinks I hear hither your husband\u2019s drum
p18632
aVSee him pluck Aufidius down by th\u2019 hair
p18633
aVAs children from a bear the Volsces shunning him
p18634
aVMethinks I see him stamp thus and call thus
p18635
aVCome on you cowards You were got in fear
p18636
aVThough you were born in Rome His bloody brow
p18637
aVWith his mailed hand then wiping forth he goes
p18638
aVLike to a harvestman that\u2019s tasked to mow
p18639
aVOr all or lose his hire
p18640
aVHis bloody brow O Jupiter no blood
p18641
aVAway you fool It more becomes a man
p18642
aVThan gilt his trophy The breasts of Hecuba
p18643
aVWhen she did suckle Hector looked not lovelier
p18644
aVThan Hector\u2019s forehead when it spit forth blood
p18645
aVAt Grecian sword contemning Tell Valeria
p18646
aVWe are fit to bid her welcome
p18647
aVHeavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius
p18648
aVHe\u2019ll beat Aufidius\u2019 head below his knee
p18649
aVAnd tread upon his neck

aVFor half a hundred years Summon the town
p18660

aVAre bringing forth our youth We\u2019ll break our walls
p18671
aVRather than they shall pound us up Our gates

p18673
aVThey\u2019ll open of themselves
p18674
aVHark you far off

aVThere is Aufidius List what work he makes
p18676
aVAmongst your cloven army
p18677
aVO they are at it
p18678
aVTheir noise be our instruction Ladders ho
p18679
aVThey fear us not but issue forth their city
p18680
aVNow put your shields before your hearts and fight
p18681
aVWith hearts more proof than shields Advance brave Titus
p18682
aVThey do disdain us much beyond our thoughts
p18683
aVWhich makes me sweat with wrath Come on my fellows
p18684
aVHe that retires I\u2019ll take him for a Volsce
p18685
aVAnd he shall feel mine edge

aVThose are they
p18834
aVThat most are willing If any such be here

aVWherein you see me smeared if any fear

aVLesser his person than an ill report

aVIf any think brave death outweighs bad life
p18839
aVAnd that his country\u2019s dearer than himself

aVLet him alone or so many so minded

aVKnow good mother
p19075
aVI had rather be their servant in my way

aVOn to the Capitol
p19078
aVAll tongues speak of him and the blearèd sights
p19079
aVAre spectacled to see him Your prattling nurse

aVHer richest lockram \u2019bout her reechy neck

p19085
aVWith variable complexions all agreeing
p19086
aVIn earnestness to see him Seld-shown flamens
p19087
aVDo press among the popular throngs and puff
p19088
aVTo win a vulgar station Our veiled dames
p19089
aVCommit the war of white and damask in
p19090
aVTheir nicely-gauded cheeks to th\u2019 wanton spoil
p19091
aVOf Phoebus\u2019 burning kisses Such a pother
p19092
aVAs if that whatsoever god who leads him

aVWere slyly crept into his human powers
p19094
aVAnd gave him graceful posture
p19095
aVOn the sudden
p19096
aVI warrant him consul
p19097
aVThen our office may
p19098
aVDuring his power go sleep
p19099
aVHe cannot temp\u2019rately transport his honors
p19100
aVFrom where he should begin and end but will
p19101
aVLose those he hath won
p19102
aVIn that there\u2019s comfort

aVUpon their ancient malice will forget
p19106
aVWith the least cause these his new honors which
p19107
aVThat he will give them make I as little question
p19108
aVAs he is proud to do \u2019t
p19109
aVI heard him swear
p19110
aVWere he to stand for consul never would he
p19111
aVAppear i\u2019 th\u2019 marketplace nor on him put
p19112
aVThe napless vesture of humility
p19113
aVNor showing as the manner is his wounds
p19114
aVTo th\u2019 people beg their stinking breaths
p19115
aV\u2019Tis right
p19116
aVIt was his word O he would miss it rather
p19117
aVThan carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him
p19118
aVAnd the desire of the nobles
p19119
aVI wish no better
p19120
aVThan have him hold that purpose and to put it
p19121
aVIn execution
p19122
aV\u2019Tis most like he will
p19123
aVIt shall be to him then as our good wills
p19124
aVA sure destruction
p19125
aVSo it must fall out
p19126
aVTo him or our authority\u2019s for an end
p19127
aVWe must suggest the people in what hatred
p19128
aVHe still hath held them that to \u2019s power he would
p19129
aVHave made them mules silenced their pleaders and
p19130
aVDispropertied their freedoms holding them
p19131
aVIn human action and capacity
p19132
aVOf no more soul nor fitness for the world
p19133
aVThan camels in their war who have their provand
p19134
aVOnly for bearing burdens and sore blows
p19135
aVFor sinking under them
p19136
aVThis as you say suggested
p19137
aVAt some time when his soaring insolence
p19138
aVShall touch the people which time shall not want
p19139
aVIf he be put upon \u2019t and that\u2019s as easy
p19140
aVAs to set dogs on sheep will be his fire
p19141
aVTo kindle their dry stubble and their blaze
p19142
aVShall darken him forever
p19143
aVWhat\u2019s the matter

aVYou are sent for to the Capitol \u2019Tis thought

aVThat Martius shall be consul I have seen

aVLadies and maids their scarves and handkerchiefs
p19149
aVUpon him as he passed the nobles bended
p19150
aVAs to Jove\u2019s statue and the Commons made
p19151
aVA shower and thunder with their caps and shouts
p19152
aVI never saw the like

aVBy Martius Caius Coriolanus whom

aVWe met here both to thank and to remember

aVWith honors like himself
p19169
aVSpeak good Cominius
p19170
aVLeave nothing out for length and make us think
p19171

p19185
aVI would you rather had been silent Please you
p19186
aVTo hear Cominius speak
p19187
aVMost willingly
p19188
aVBut yet my caution was more pertinent
p19189
aVThan the rebuke you give it
p19190
aVHe loves your people
p19191
aVBut tie him not to be their bedfellow
p19192
aVWorthy Cominius speak

aVThan one on \u2019s ears to hear it Proceed Cominius
p19214
aVI shall lack voice The deeds of Coriolanus
p19215
aVShould not be uttered feebly It is held
p19216
aVThat valor is the chiefest virtue and
p19217
aVMost dignifies the haver if it be

aVWhen Tarquin made a head for Rome he fought
p19221
aVBeyond the mark of others Our then dictator
p19222
aVWhom with all praise I point at saw him fight
p19223
aVWhen with his Amazonian chin he drove
p19224
aVThe bristled lips before him He bestrid
p19225
aVAn o\u2019erpressed Roman and i\u2019 th\u2019 Consul\u2019s view

aVSlew three opposers Tarquin\u2019s self he met
p19227
aVAnd struck him on his knee In that day\u2019s feats
p19228
aVWhen he might act the woman in the scene
p19229
aVHe proved best man i\u2019 th\u2019 field and for his meed
p19230
aVWas brow-bound with the oak His pupil age
p19231
aVMan-entered thus he waxèd like a sea
p19232
aVAnd in the brunt of seventeen battles since
p19233
aVHe lurched all swords of the garland For this last
p19234
aVBefore and in Corioles let me say
p19235
aVI cannot speak him home He stopped the flyers
p19236
aVAnd by his rare example made the coward
p19237
aVTurn terror into sport As weeds before
p19238
aVA vessel under sail so men obeyed
p19239
aVAnd fell below his stem His sword Death\u2019s stamp
p19240
aVWhere it did mark it took from face to foot
p19241
aVHe was a thing of blood whose every motion
p19242
aVWas timed with dying cries Alone he entered
p19243
aVThe mortal gate o\u2019 th\u2019 city which he painted
p19244
aVWith shunless destiny aidless came off
p19245
aVAnd with a sudden reinforcement struck

aVCorioles like a planet Now all\u2019s his

aVWhen by and by the din of war gan pierce
p19248
aVHis ready sense then straight his doubled spirit
p19249
aVRequickened what in flesh was fatigate
p19250
aVAnd to the battle came he where he did
p19251
aVRun reeking o\u2019er the lives of men as if
p19252
aV\u2019Twere a perpetual spoil and till we called
p19253
aVBoth field and city ours he never stood

aVTo ease his breast with panting
p19255
aVWorthy man
p19256
aVHe cannot but with measure fit the honors
p19257
aVWhich we devise him
p19258
aVOur spoils he kicked at
p19259
aVAnd looked upon things precious as they were
p19260

aVThan misery itself would give rewards
p19262
aVHis deeds with doing them and is content

aVAmen sir To my poor unworthy notice
p19374
aVHe mocked us when he begged our voices

aVCertainly he flouted us downright
p19376
aVNo \u2019tis his kind of speech He did not mock us
p19377
aVNot one amongst us save yourself but says
p19378
aVHe used us scornfully He should have showed us
p19379
aVHis marks of merit wounds received for \u2019s country
p19380
aVWhy so he did I am sure
p19381
aVNo no No man saw \u2019em
p19382
aVHe said he had wounds which he could show in private

p19390
aVWhy either were you ignorant to see \u2019t
p19391
aVOr seeing it of such childish friendliness
p19392
aVTo yield your voices
p19393
aVCould you not have told him
p19394
aVAs you were lessoned When he had no power
p19395
aVBut was a petty servant to the state
p19396
aVHe was your enemy ever spake against

aVYour liberties and the charters that you bear
p19398
aVI\u2019 th\u2019 body of the weal and now arriving

aVA place of potency and sway o\u2019 th\u2019 state
p19400
aVIf he should still malignantly remain
p19401
aVFast foe to th\u2019 plebeii your voices might
p19402
aVBe curses to yourselves You should have said
p19403
aVThat as his worthy deeds did claim no less
p19404
aVThan what he stood for so his gracious nature
p19405
aVWould think upon you for your voices and
p19406
aVTranslate his malice towards you into love
p19407
aVStanding your friendly lord
p19408
aVThus to have said
p19409
aVAs you were fore-advised had touched his spirit
p19410
aVAnd tried his inclination from him plucked
p19411
aVEither his gracious promise which you might
p19412
aVAs cause had called you up have held him to
p19413
aVOr else it would have galled his surly nature
p19414
aVWhich easily endures not article
p19415
aVTying him to aught So putting him to rage
p19416
aVYou should have ta\u2019en th\u2019 advantage of his choler
p19417
aVAnd passed him unelected
p19418
aVDid you perceive
p19419
aVHe did solicit you in free contempt
p19420
aVWhen he did need your loves and do you think
p19421
aVThat his contempt shall not be bruising to you
p19422
aVWhen he hath power to crush Why had your bodies
p19423
aVNo heart among you Or had you tongues to cry
p19424
aVAgainst the rectorship of judgment
p19425
aVHave you ere now denied the asker And now

aVHe\u2019s not confirmed
p19429
aVWe may deny him yet

aVGet you hence instantly and tell those friends
p19434
aVThey have chose a consul that will from them take
p19435
aVTheir liberties make them of no more voice
p19436
aVThan dogs that are as often beat for barking
p19437
aVAs therefor kept to do so
p19438
aVLet them assemble
p19439
aVAnd on a safer judgment all revoke
p19440
aVYour ignorant election Enforce his pride
p19441
aVAnd his old hate unto you Besides forget not
p19442
aVWith what contempt he wore the humble weed
p19443
aVHow in his suit he scorned you but your loves
p19444
aVThinking upon his services took from you
p19445
aVTh\u2019 apprehension of his present portance
p19446
aVWhich most gibingly ungravely he did fashion
p19447
aVAfter the inveterate hate he bears you
p19448
aVLay
p19449
aVA fault on us your tribunes that we labored
p19450
aVNo impediment between but that you must
p19451
aVCast your election on him
p19452
aVSay you chose him
p19453
aVMore after our commandment than as guided
p19454
aVBy your own true affections and that your minds
p19455
aVPreoccupied with what you rather must do
p19456
aVThan what you should made you against the grain
p19457
aVTo voice him consul Lay the fault on us
p19458
aVAy spare us not Say we read lectures to you
p19459
aVHow youngly he began to serve his country
p19460
aVHow long continued and what stock he springs of
p19461
aVThe noble house o\u2019 th\u2019 Martians from whence came
p19462
aVThat Ancus Martius Numa\u2019s daughter\u2019s son
p19463
aVWho after great Hostilius here was king
p19464
aVOf the same house Publius and Quintus were
p19465
aVThat our best water brought by conduits hither
p19466
aVAnd Censorinus that was so surnamed
p19467
aVAnd nobly namèd so twice being censor
p19468
aVWas his great ancestor
p19469
aVOne thus descended
p19470
aVThat hath besides well in his person wrought
p19471
aVTo be set high in place we did commend
p19472
aVTo your remembrances but you have found
p19473
aVScaling his present bearing with his past
p19474
aVThat he\u2019s your fixèd enemy and revoke
p19475
aVYour sudden approbation
p19476
aVSay you ne\u2019er had done \u2019t
p19477

aVWe will so Almost all
p19481
aVRepent in their election
p19482
aVLet them go on
p19483
aVThis mutiny were better put in hazard
p19484
aVThan stay past doubt for greater
p19485
aVIf as his nature is he fall in rage
p19486
aVWith their refusal both observe and answer
p19487
aVThe vantage of his anger
p19488
aVTo th\u2019 Capitol come
p19489
aVWe will be there before the stream o\u2019 th\u2019 people
p19490
aVAnd this shall seem as partly \u2019tis their own

aVTullus Aufidius then had made new head
p19493
aVHe had my lord and that it was which caused
p19494
aVOur swifter composition
p19495
aVSo then the Volsces stand but as at first
p19496
aVReady when time shall prompt them to make road
p19497
aVUpon \u2019s again
p19498
aVThey are worn lord consul so

aVHow often he had met you sword to sword
p19509
aVThat of all things upon the earth he hated
p19510
aVYour person most that he would pawn his fortunes
p19511
aVTo hopeless restitution so he might
p19512
aVBe called your vanquisher
p19513
aVAt Antium lives he
p19514
aVAt Antium
p19515
aVI wish I had a cause to seek him there
p19516
aVTo oppose his hatred fully Welcome home
p19517
aVBehold these are the tribunes of the people
p19518
aVThe tongues o\u2019 th\u2019 common mouth I do despise them
p19519
aVFor they do prank them in authority
p19520
aVAgainst all noble sufferance
p19521
aVPass no further
p19522
aVHa What is that
p19523
aVIt will be dangerous to go on No further

aVThe matter
p19526
aVHath he not passed the noble and the common

aVTribunes give way He shall to th\u2019 marketplace
p19530
aVThe people are incensed against him

p19537
aVHave you not set them on
p19538
aVBe calm be calm
p19539
aVIt is a purposed thing and grows by plot
p19540
aVTo curb the will of the nobility
p19541
aVSuffer \u2019t and live with such as cannot rule
p19542
aVNor ever will be ruled
p19543
aVCall \u2019t not a plot

aVHow I inform them
p19552
aVYou are like to do such business
p19553

aVYour fellow tribune
p19557
aVYou show too much of that

aVFor which the people stir If you will pass
p19559
aVTo where you are bound you must inquire your way
p19560
aVWhich you are out of with a gentler spirit
p19561
aVOr never be so noble as a consul

aVNor yoke with him for tribune
p19563
aVLet\u2019s be calm

aVThe cruelty and envy of the people
p20440
aVPermitted by our dastard nobles who
p20441
aVHave all forsook me hath devoured the rest
p20442
aVAnd suffered me by th\u2019 voice of slaves to be
p20443
aVWhooped out of Rome Now this extremity

aVThat my revengeful services may prove
p20455
aVAs benefits to thee for I will fight
p20456
aVAgainst my cankered country with the spleen
p20457
aVOf all the under fiends But if so be

p20471
aVAnd say \u2019tis true I\u2019d not believe them more
p20472
aVThan thee all-noble Martius Let me twine
p20473
aVMine arms about that body whereagainst
p20474
aVMy grainèd ash an hundred times hath broke
p20475
aVAnd scarred the moon with splinters
p20476
aVHere I clip
p20477
aVThe anvil of my sword and do contest
p20478
aVAs hotly and as nobly with thy love
p20479
aVAs ever in ambitious strength I did
p20480
aVContend against thy valor Know thou first

aVI loved the maid I married never man
p20482
aVSighed truer breath But that I see thee here
p20483

aVThan when I first my wedded mistress saw

aVWe have been down together in my sleep
p20492
aVUnbuckling helms fisting each other\u2019s throat
p20493
aVAnd waked half dead with nothing Worthy Martius
p20494
aVHad we no other quarrel else to Rome but that
p20495
aVThou art thence banished we would muster all
p20496
aVFrom twelve to seventy and pouring war

p20551
aVCaius Martius was
p20552
aVA worthy officer i\u2019 th\u2019 war but insolent
p20553
aVO\u2019ercome with pride ambitious past all thinking
p20554
aVSelf-loving
p20555
aVAnd affecting one sole throne without assistance
p20556
aVI think not so
p20557
aVWe should by this to all our lamentation
p20558
aVIf he had gone forth consul found it so
p20559
aVThe gods have well prevented it and Rome
p20560
aVSits safe and still without him
p20561
aVWorthy tribunes
p20562
aVThere is a slave whom we have put in prison
p20563
aVReports the Volsces with two several powers
p20564
aVAre entered in the Roman territories
p20565
aVAnd with the deepest malice of the war
p20566
aVDestroy what lies before \u2019em
p20567
aV\u2019Tis Aufidius
p20568
aVWho hearing of our Martius\u2019 banishment
p20569
aVThrusts forth his horns again into the world
p20570
aVWhich were inshelled when Martius stood for Rome
p20571
aVAnd durst not once peep out
p20572
aVCome what talk you of Martius
p20573
aVGo see this rumorer whipped It cannot be
p20574
aVThe Volsces dare break with us
p20575
aVCannot be
p20576
aVWe have record that very well it can
p20577
aVAnd three examples of the like hath been
p20578
aVWithin my age But reason with the fellow
p20579
aVBefore you punish him where he heard this
p20580
aVLest you shall chance to whip your information
p20581
aVAnd beat the messenger who bids beware
p20582
aVOf what is to be dreaded
p20583
aVTell not me
p20584
aVI know this cannot be
p20585
aVNot possible
p20586
aVThe nobles in great earnestness are going
p20587
aVAll to the Senate House Some news is coming
p20588
aVThat turns their countenances

aVNothing but his report
p20592
aVYes worthy sir
p20593
aVThe slave\u2019s report is seconded and more
p20594
aVMore fearful is delivered
p20595
aVWhat more fearful
p20596
aVIt is spoke freely out of many mouths
p20597
aVHow probable I do not know that Martius
p20598
aVJoined with Aufidius leads a power \u2019gainst Rome
p20599
aVAnd vows revenge as spacious as between
p20600
aVThe young\u2019st and oldest thing
p20601
aVThis is most likely
p20602
aVRaised only that the weaker sort may wish
p20603
aVGood Martius home again
p20604
aVThe very trick on \u2019t
p20605
aVThis is unlikely
p20606
aVHe and Aufidius can no more atone
p20607
aVThan violent\u2019st contrariety

aVYou have made fair work I fear me Pray your news
p20625
aVIf Martius should be joined with Volscians
p20626
aVIf
p20627
aVHe is their god he leads them like a thing
p20628
aVMade by some other deity than Nature
p20629
aVThat shapes man better and they follow him
p20630
aVAgainst us brats with no less confidence

aVUpon the voice of occupation and
p20636
aVThe breath of garlic eaters
p20637
aVHe\u2019ll shake your Rome about your ears

aVAy and you\u2019ll look pale
p20642
aVBefore you find it other All the regions
p20643
aVDo smilingly revolt and who resists

p20649
aVWho shall ask it
p20650
aVThe Tribunes cannot do \u2019t for shame the people
p20651
aVDeserve such pity of him as the wolf
p20652
aVDoes of the shepherds For his best friends if they
p20653
aVShould say Be good to Rome they charged him even
p20654
aVAs those should do that had deserved his hate
p20655
aVAnd therein showed like enemies
p20656
aV\u2019Tis true
p20657
aVIf he were putting to my house the brand

aVSay not we brought it
p20665
aVHow Was \u2019t we We loved him but like beasts
p20666
aVAnd cowardly nobles gave way unto your clusters
p20667
aVWho did hoot him out o\u2019 th\u2019 city

aVBut I fear
p20669
aVThey\u2019ll roar him in again Tullus Aufidius
p20670
aVThe second name of men obeys his points
p20671
aVAs if he were his officer Desperation
p20672
aVIs all the policy strength and defense
p20673
aVThat Rome can make against them
p20674
aVHere come the clusters
p20675
aVAnd is Aufidius with him You are they
p20676
aVThat made the air unwholesome when you cast
p20677
aVYour stinking greasy caps in hooting at
p20678
aVCoriolanus\u2019 exile Now he\u2019s coming
p20679
aVAnd not a hair upon a soldier\u2019s head

aVAs you threw caps up will he tumble down
p20682
aVAnd pay you for your voices \u2019Tis no matter

aVIf he could burn us all into one coal
p20684
aVWe have deserved it

aVFaith we hear fearful news
p20686
aVFor mine own part
p20687

aVDo they still fly to th\u2019 Roman
p20704
aVI do not know what witchcraft\u2019s in him but
p20705
aVYour soldiers use him as the grace \u2019fore meat
p20706
aVTheir talk at table and their thanks at end
p20707
aVAnd you are dark\u2019ned in this action sir
p20708
aVEven by your own
p20709
aVI cannot help it now
p20710
aVUnless by using means I lame the foot
p20711
aVOf our design He bears himself more proudlier
p20712
aVEven to my person than I thought he would
p20713
aVWhen first I did embrace him Yet his nature
p20714
aVIn that\u2019s no changeling and I must excuse
p20715
aVWhat cannot be amended
p20716
aVYet I wish sir
p20717
aVI mean for your particular you had not
p20718
aVJoined in commission with him but either
p20719
aVHave borne the action of yourself or else
p20720
aVTo him had left it solely
p20721
aVI understand thee well and be thou sure
p20722
aVWhen he shall come to his account he knows not
p20723
aVWhat I can urge against him although it seems
p20724
aVAnd so he thinks and is no less apparent
p20725
aVTo th\u2019 vulgar eye that he bears all things fairly
p20726
aVAnd shows good husbandry for the Volscian state
p20727
aVFights dragonlike and does achieve as soon
p20728
aVAs draw his sword yet he hath left undone
p20729
aVThat which shall break his neck or hazard mine
p20730
aVWhene\u2019er we come to our account
p20731
aVSir I beseech you think you he\u2019ll carry Rome
p20732
aVAll places yields to him ere he sits down
p20733
aVAnd the nobility of Rome are his
p20734
aVThe Senators and Patricians love him too
p20735
aVThe Tribunes are no soldiers and their people
p20736
aVWill be as rash in the repeal as hasty
p20737
aVTo expel him thence I think he\u2019ll be to Rome
p20738
aVAs is the osprey to the fish who takes it
p20739
aVBy sovereignty of nature First he was
p20740
aVA noble servant to them but he could not
p20741
aVCarry his honors even Whether \u2019twas pride
p20742
aVWhich out of daily fortune ever taints
p20743
aVThe happy man whether defect of judgment
p20744
aVTo fail in the disposing of those chances
p20745
aVWhich he was lord of or whether nature

aVNot to be other than one thing not moving
p20747
aVFrom th\u2019 casque to th\u2019 cushion but commanding peace
p20748
aVEven with the same austerity and garb
p20749
aVAs he controlled the war but one of these
p20750
aVAs he hath spices of them all not all
p20751
aVFor I dare so far free him made him feared
p20752
aVSo hated and so banished But he has a merit
p20753
aVTo choke it in the utt\u2019rance So our virtues
p20754
aVLie in th\u2019 interpretation of the time

aVIn a most dear particular He called me father

p20769
aVHe would not seem to know me
p20770
aVDo you hear
p20771
aVYet one time he did call me by my name
p20772
aVI urged our old acquaintance and the drops
p20773
aVThat we have bled together Coriolanus
p20774
aVHe would not answer to forbade all names
p20775
aVHe was a kind of nothing titleless

aVOf burning Rome
p20778
aVWhy so you have made good work

aVA pair of tribunes that have wracked Rome

aVTo make coals cheap A noble memory
p20781
aVI minded him how royal \u2019twas to pardon
p20782
aVWhen it was less expected He replied
p20783
aVIt was a bare petition of a state
p20784

aVVery well
p20786
aVCould he say less
p20787
aVI offered to awaken his regard
p20788
aVFor \u2019s private friends His answer to me was
p20789
aVHe could not stay to pick them in a pile
p20790
aVOf noisome musty chaff He said \u2019twas folly
p20791
aVFor one poor grain or two to leave unburnt
p20792
aVAnd still to nose th\u2019 offense
p20793
aVFor one poor grain or two
p20794
aVI am one of those His mother wife his child
p20795
aVAnd this brave fellow too we are the grains
p20796
aVYou are the musty chaff and you are smelt
p20797
aVAbove the moon We must be burnt for you
p20798
aVNay pray be patient If you refuse your aid
p20799
aVIn this so-never-needed help yet do not

aVFor Rome towards Martius
p20809
aVWell and say that Martius

p20811
aVWhat then But as a discontented friend
p20812
aVGrief-shot with his unkindness Say \u2019t be so
p20813
aVYet your good will

aVAs you intended well
p20816
aVI\u2019ll undertake \u2019t
p20817
aVI think he\u2019ll hear me Yet to bite his lip
p20818
aVAnd hum at good Cominius much unhearts me
p20819
aVHe was not taken well he had not dined
p20820
aVThe veins unfilled our blood is cold and then
p20821
aVWe pout upon the morning are unapt
p20822
aVTo give or to forgive but when we have stuffed
p20823
aVThese pipes and these conveyances of our blood
p20824
aVWith wine and feeding we have suppler souls
p20825
aVThan in our priestlike fasts Therefore I\u2019ll watch him

aVRed as \u2019twould burn Rome and his injury
p20837
aVThe jailor to his pity I kneeled before him
p20838
aV\u2019Twas very faintly he said Rise dismissed me
p20839
aVThus with his speechless hand What he would do
p20840
aVHe sent in writing after me what he
p20841
aVWould not bound with an oath to yield to his
p20842
aVConditions So that all hope is vain
p20843
aVUnless his noble mother and his wife
p20844
aVWho as I hear mean to solicit him
p20845
aVFor mercy to his country Therefore let\u2019s hence

aVSeducing so my friends and to this end

aVOne bred of alms and fostered with cold dishes

aVA pantler not so eminent
p22108
aVProfane fellow

aVIs yet fresh in their grief

aVStatist though I am none nor like to be
p22165
aVThat this will prove a war and you shall hear
p22166
aVThe legion now in Gallia sooner landed

aVIn our not-fearing Britain than have tidings
p22168
aVOf any penny tribute paid Our countrymen
p22169
aVAre men more ordered than when Julius Caesar
p22170
aVSmiled at their lack of skill but found their courage
p22171
aVWorthy his frowning at Their discipline
p22172
aVNow wingèd with their courages will make known
p22173
aVTo their approvers they are people such
p22174
aVThat mend upon the world

p22181
aVThe speediness of your return

aVYour lady

aVIs one of the fairest that I have looked upon
p22184
aVAnd therewithal the best or let her beauty

aVLook thorough a casement to allure false hearts
p22186
aVAnd be false with them
p22187
aVHere are letters for you
p22188
aVTheir tenor good I trust
p22189
aV\u2019Tis very like

aVHe was expected then but not approached

aVI should have lost the worth of it in gold
p22198
aVI\u2019ll make a journey twice as far t\u2019 enjoy

aVA second night of such sweet shortness which
p22200
aVWas mine in Britain for the ring is won
p22201
aVThe stone\u2019s too hard to come by
p22202
aVNot a whit
p22203
aVYour lady being so easy

aVMake not sir

aVYour loss your sport I hope you know that we

aVGood sir we must
p22208
aVIf you keep covenant Had I not brought
p22209
aVThe knowledge of your mistress home I grant
p22210
aVWe were to question farther but I now
p22211
aVProfess myself the winner of her honor

aVYour sword or mine or masterless leave both

aVTo who shall find them
p22221
aVSir my circumstances
p22222
aVBeing so near the truth as I will make them
p22223
aVMust first induce you to believe whose strength
p22224
aVI will confirm with oath which I doubt not
p22225
aVYou\u2019ll give me leave to spare when you shall find
p22226
aVYou need it not
p22227
aVProceed
p22228
aVFirst her bedchamber
p22229
aVWhere I confess I slept not but profess

aVHad that was well worth watching it was hanged
p22231
aVWith tapestry of silk and silver the story

aVProud Cleopatra when she met her Roman
p22233
aVAnd Cydnus swelled above the banks or for
p22234
aVThe press of boats or pride A piece of work
p22235
aVSo bravely done so rich that it did strive
p22236
aVIn workmanship and value which I wondered
p22237
aVCould be so rarely and exactly wrought
p22238
aVSince the true life on \u2019t was
p22239
aVThis is true
p22240
aVAnd this you might have heard of here by me
p22241
aVOr by some other
p22242
aVMore particulars
p22243
aVMust justify my knowledge

aVSo they must

aVIs south the chamber and the chimney-piece
p22248
aVChaste Dian bathing Never saw I figures

aVSo likely to report themselves the cutter
p22250
aVWas as another Nature dumb outwent her
p22251
aVMotion and breath left out

aVThis is a thing
p22253
aVWhich you might from relation likewise reap
p22254
aVBeing as it is much spoke of

aVThe roof o\u2019 th\u2019 chamber

aVWith golden cherubins is fretted Her andirons

aVI had forgot them were two winking Cupids
p22258
aVOf silver each on one foot standing nicely
p22259
aVDepending on their brands
p22260
aVThis is her honor
p22261
aVLet it be granted you have seen all this and praise
p22262
aVBe given to your remembrance the description
p22263
aVOf what is in her chamber nothing saves
p22264
aVThe wager you have laid
p22265
aVThen if you can

aVShe stripped it from her arm I see her yet
p22274
aVHer pretty action did outsell her gift
p22275
aVAnd yet enriched it too She gave it me
p22276
aVAnd said she prized it once
p22277
aVMaybe she plucked it off
p22278
aVTo send it me
p22279
aVShe writes so to you doth she
p22280
aVO no no no \u2019tis true Here take this too

aVKills me to look on \u2019t Let there be no honor
p22283
aVWhere there is beauty truth where semblance love
p22284
aVWhere there\u2019s another man The vows of women
p22285
aVOf no more bondage be to where they are made
p22286
aVThan they are to their virtues which is nothing
p22287
aVO above measure false
p22288
aVHave patience sir

aVAnd take your ring again \u2019Tis not yet won

aVHark you he swears By Jupiter he swears
p22299
aV\u2019Tis true nay keep the ring \u2019tis true

aVI am sure
p22301
aVShe would not lose it Her attendants are
p22302
aVAll sworn and honorable They induced to steal it
p22303
aVAnd by a stranger No he hath enjoyed her
p22304
aVThe cognizance of her incontinency
p22305
aVIs this She hath bought the name of whore thus dearly
p22306
aVThere take thy hire and all the fiends of hell
p22307
aVDivide themselves between you

aVIf you seek
p22314
aVFor further satisfying under her breast
p22315
aVWorthy the pressing lies a mole right proud
p22316
aVOf that most delicate lodging By my life
p22317
aVI kissed it and it gave me present hunger
p22318
aVTo feed again though full You do remember
p22319
aVThis stain upon her
p22320
aVAy and it doth confirm
p22321
aVAnother stain as big as hell can hold

aVWere there no more but it
p22323
aVWill you hear more

aVYield rustic mountaineer

aVNo company\u2019s abroad
p23240
aVNone in the world You did mistake him sure
p23241
aVI cannot tell Long is it since I saw him
p23242
aVBut time hath nothing blurred those lines of favor
p23243
aVWhich then he wore The snatches in his voice
p23244
aVAnd burst of speaking were as his I am absolute

aVI wish my brother make good time with him

aVBeing scarce made up
p23250
aVI mean to man he had not apprehension

aVOf roaring terrors for defect of judgment
p23252
aVIs oft the cause of fear
p23253
aVBut see thy brother
p23254
aVThis Cloten was a fool an empty purse

aVThere was no money in \u2019t Not Hercules
p23256
aVCould have knocked out his brains for he had none
p23257
aVYet I not doing this the fool had borne
p23258
aVMy head as I do his

aVWhat hast thou done
p23260
aVI am perfect what cut off one Cloten\u2019s head

aVSon to the Queen after his own report

aVWith his own single hand he\u2019d take us in

aVDisplace our heads where thank the gods they grow
p23265
aVAnd set them on Lud\u2019s Town
p23266
aVWe are all undone
p23267
aVWhy worthy father what have we to lose
p23268
aVBut that he swore to take our lives The law
p23269
aVProtects not us Then why should we be tender
p23270
aVTo let an arrogant piece of flesh threat us
p23271
aVPlay judge and executioner all himself
p23272
aVFor we do fear the law What company

aVDiscover you abroad
p23274
aVNo single soul
p23275
aVCan we set eye on but in all safe reason
p23276
aVHe must have some attendants Though his humor
p23277
aVWas nothing but mutation ay and that
p23278
aVFrom one bad thing to worse not frenzy
p23279
aVNot absolute madness could so far have raved
p23280
aVTo bring him here alone Although perhaps
p23281
aVIt may be heard at court that such as we
p23282
aVCave here hunt here are outlaws and in time
p23283
aVMay make some stronger head the which he hearing
p23284
aVAs it is like him might break out and swear
p23285
aVHe\u2019d fetch us in yet is \u2019t not probable
p23286
aVTo come alone either he so undertaking
p23287
aVOr they so suffering Then on good ground we fear
p23288
aVIf we do fear this body hath a tail
p23289
aVMore perilous than the head
p23290
aVLet ord\u2019nance
p23291
aVCome as the gods foresay it Howsoe\u2019er
p23292
aVMy brother hath done well
p23293
aVI had no mind
p23294
aVTo hunt this day The boy Fidele\u2019s sickness

aVDid make my way long forth
p23296
aVWith his own sword
p23297
aVWhich he did wave against my throat I have ta\u2019en
p23298
aVHis head from him I\u2019ll throw \u2019t into the creek
p23299
aVBehind our rock and let it to the sea
p23300
aVAnd tell the fishes he\u2019s the Queen\u2019s son Cloten
p23301
aVThat\u2019s all I reck
p23302
aVI fear \u2019twill be revenged
p23303
aVWould Polydor thou hadst not done \u2019t though valor
p23304
aVBecomes thee well enough
p23305
aVWould I had done \u2019t
p23306
aVSo the revenge alone pursued me Polydor
p23307
aVI love thee brotherly but envy much
p23308
aVThou hast robbed me of this deed I would revenges
p23309
aVThat possible strength might meet would seek us through
p23310
aVAnd put us to our answer
p23311
aVWell \u2019tis done
p23312
aVWe\u2019ll hunt no more today nor seek for danger
p23313
aVWhere there\u2019s no profit I prithee to our rock

aVAnd praise myself for charity
p23321
aVO thou goddess
p23322
aVThou divine Nature thou thyself thou blazon\u2019st
p23323
aVIn these two princely boys They are as gentle
p23324
aVAs zephyrs blowing below the violet
p23325
aVNot wagging his sweet head and yet as rough
p23326
aVTheir royal blood enchafed as the rud\u2019st wind
p23327
aVThat by the top doth take the mountain pine
p23328
aVAnd make him stoop to th\u2019 vale \u2019Tis wonder
p23329
aVThat an invisible instinct should frame them
p23330
aVTo royalty unlearned honor untaught
p23331
aVCivility not seen from other valor
p23332
aVThat wildly grows in them but yields a crop
p23333
aVAs if it had been sowed Yet still it\u2019s strange
p23334
aVWhat Cloten\u2019s being here to us portends
p23335
aVOr what his death will bring us
p23336
aVWhere\u2019s my brother

aVIt did not speak before All solemn things
p23347
aVShould answer solemn accidents The matter
p23348
aVTriumphs for nothing and lamenting toys
p23349
aVIs jollity for apes and grief for boys
p23350
aVIs Cadwal mad
p23351
aVLook here he comes
p23352
aVAnd brings the dire occasion in his arms
p23353
aVOf what we blame him for
p23354
aVThe bird is dead
p23355
aVThat we have made so much on I had rather
p23356
aVHave skipped from sixteen years of age to sixty
p23357
aVTo have turned my leaping time into a crutch

p23371
aVNot as Death\u2019s dart being laughed at his right cheek

aVWhere

aVO\u2019 th\u2019 floor

p23376
aVMy clouted brogues from off my feet whose rudeness
p23377
aVAnswered my steps too loud
p23378
aVWhy he but sleeps
p23379
aVIf he be gone he\u2019ll make his grave a bed
p23380
aVWith female fairies will his tomb be haunted
p23381
aVAnd worms will not come to thee
p23382
aVWith fairest flowers
p23383
aVWhilst summer lasts and I live here Fidele

aVThis is sir a doubt
p23655
aVIn such a time nothing becoming you

aVBut to be still hot summer\u2019s tanlings and
p23672
aVThe shrinking slaves of winter

aVBetter to cease to be Pray sir to th\u2019 army

aVI am not partial to infringe our laws

aVHave sealed his rigorous statutes with their bloods
p24574

aVFor since the mortal and intestine jars
p24576
aV\u2019Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us
p24577
aVIt hath in solemn synods been decreed
p24578
aVBoth by the Syracusians and ourselves

aVTo admit no traffic to our adverse towns

aVYet this my comfort when your words are done
p24591
aVMy woes end likewise with the evening sun
p24592
aVWell Syracusian say in brief the cause
p24593
aVWhy thou departedst from thy native home
p24594
aVAnd for what cause thou cam\u2019st to Ephesus
p24595
aVA heavier task could not have been imposed
p24596
aVThan I to speak my griefs unspeakable
p24597
aVYet that the world may witness that my end
p24598
aVWas wrought by nature not by vile offense
p24599
aVI\u2019ll utter what my sorrow gives me leave
p24600
aVIn Syracusa was I born and wed
p24601
aVUnto a woman happy but for me
p24602
aVAnd by me had not our hap been bad
p24603
aVWith her I lived in joy Our wealth increased
p24604
aVBy prosperous voyages I often made
p24605
aVTo Epidamium till my factor\u2019s death
p24606
aVAnd the great care of goods at random left
p24607
aVDrew me from kind embracements of my spouse
p24608
aVFrom whom my absence was not six months old
p24609
aVBefore herself almost at fainting under
p24610
aVThe pleasing punishment that women bear
p24611
aVHad made provision for her following me
p24612
aVAnd soon and safe arrivèd where I was
p24613
aVThere had she not been long but she became
p24614
aVA joyful mother of two goodly sons
p24615
aVAnd which was strange the one so like the other
p24616
aVAs could not be distinguished but by names
p24617
aVThat very hour and in the selfsame inn
p24618
aVA mean woman was deliverèd
p24619
aVOf such a burden male twins both alike
p24620
aVThose for their parents were exceeding poor
p24621
aVI bought and brought up to attend my sons
p24622
aVMy wife not meanly proud of two such boys
p24623
aVMade daily motions for our home return
p24624
aVUnwilling I agreed Alas too soon
p24625
aVWe came aboard
p24626
aVA league from Epidamium had we sailed
p24627
aVBefore the always-wind-obeying deep
p24628
aVGave any tragic instance of our harm
p24629
aVBut longer did we not retain much hope
p24630
aVFor what obscurèd light the heavens did grant
p24631
aVDid but convey unto our fearful minds
p24632
aVA doubtful warrant of immediate death
p24633
aVWhich though myself would gladly have embraced
p24634
aVYet the incessant weepings of my wife
p24635
aVWeeping before for what she saw must come
p24636
aVAnd piteous plainings of the pretty babes
p24637
aVThat mourned for fashion ignorant what to fear
p24638
aVForced me to seek delays for them and me
p24639
aVAnd this it was for other means was none
p24640
aVThe sailors sought for safety by our boat
p24641
aVAnd left the ship then sinking-ripe to us
p24642
aVMy wife more careful for the latter-born
p24643
aVHad fastened him unto a small spare mast
p24644
aVSuch as seafaring men provide for storms
p24645
aVTo him one of the other twins was bound
p24646
aVWhilst I had been like heedful of the other
p24647
aVThe children thus disposed my wife and I
p24648
aVFixing our eyes on whom our care was fixed
p24649
aVFastened ourselves at either end the mast
p24650
aVAnd floating straight obedient to the stream
p24651
aVWas carried towards Corinth as we thought
p24652
aVAt length the sun gazing upon the earth
p24653
aVDispersed those vapors that offended us
p24654
aVAnd by the benefit of his wished light
p24655
aVThe seas waxed calm and we discoverèd
p24656
aVTwo ships from far making amain to us
p24657
aVOf Corinth that of Epidaurus this
p24658
aVBut ere they came O let me say no more
p24659
aVGather the sequel by that went before
p24660
aVNay forward old man Do not break off so
p24661
aVFor we may pity though not pardon thee
p24662
aVO had the gods done so I had not now
p24663

aVFor ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues
p24665
aVWe were encountered by a mighty rock
p24666
aVWhich being violently borne upon
p24667
aVOur helpful ship was splitted in the midst
p24668
aVSo that in this unjust divorce of us
p24669
aVFortune had left to both of us alike
p24670
aVWhat to delight in what to sorrow for
p24671
aVHer part poor soul seeming as burdenèd
p24672
aVWith lesser weight but not with lesser woe
p24673
aVWas carried with more speed before the wind
p24674
aVAnd in our sight they three were taken up
p24675
aVBy fishermen of Corinth as we thought
p24676
aVAt length another ship had seized on us
p24677
aVAnd knowing whom it was their hap to save
p24678
aVGave healthful welcome to their shipwracked guests
p24679
aVAnd would have reft the fishers of their prey
p24680
aVHad not their bark been very slow of sail
p24681
aVAnd therefore homeward did they bend their course
p24682
aVThus have you heard me severed from my bliss
p24683
aVThat by misfortunes was my life prolonged
p24684
aVTo tell sad stories of my own mishaps
p24685
aVAnd for the sake of them thou sorrowest for

aVDo me the favor to dilate at full
p24687
aVWhat have befall\u2019n of them and thee till now

aVI hazarded the loss of whom I loved
p24696
aVFive summers have I spent in farthest Greece
p24697
aVRoaming clean through the bounds of Asia

aVAnd coasting homeward came to Ephesus
p24699
aVHopeless to find yet loath to leave unsought
p24700
aVOr that or any place that harbors men

aVThen let your will attend on their accords
p24853
aVThis servitude makes you to keep unwed

p25734
aVI knew he was not in his perfect wits
p25735

p25736
aVHow long hath this possession held the man
p25737
aVThis week he hath been heavy sour sad
p25738
aVAnd much different from the man he was
p25739
aVBut till this afternoon his passion
p25740
aVNe\u2019er brake into extremity of rage
p25741
aVHath he not lost much wealth by wrack of sea
p25742
aVBuried some dear friend Hath not else his eye
p25743
aVStrayed his affection in unlawful love
p25744
aVA sin prevailing much in youthful men
p25745
aVWho give their eyes the liberty of gazing
p25746
aVWhich of these sorrows is he subject to
p25747
aVTo none of these except it be the last
p25748
aVNamely some love that drew him oft from home
p25749
aVYou should for that have reprehended him
p25750
aVWhy so I did
p25751
aVAy but not rough enough
p25752
aVAs roughly as my modesty would let me
p25753
aVHaply in private
p25754
aVAnd in assemblies too
p25755
aVAy but not enough
p25756
aVIt was the copy of our conference
p25757
aVIn bed he slept not for my urging it
p25758
aVAt board he fed not for my urging it
p25759
aVAlone it was the subject of my theme
p25760
aVIn company I often glancèd it
p25761
aVStill did I tell him it was vile and bad
p25762
aVAnd thereof came it that the man was mad
p25763
aVThe venom clamors of a jealous woman
p25764
aVPoisons more deadly than a mad dog\u2019s tooth
p25765
aVIt seems his sleeps were hindered by thy railing
p25766
aVAnd thereof comes it that his head is light
p25767
aVThou sayst his meat was sauced with thy upbraidings
p25768
aVUnquiet meals make ill digestions
p25769
aVThereof the raging fire of fever bred
p25770
aVAnd what\u2019s a fever but a fit of madness
p25771
aVThou sayest his sports were hindered by thy brawls
p25772
aVSweet recreation barred what doth ensue
p25773
aVBut moody and dull melancholy
p25774
aVKinsman to grim and comfortless despair
p25775
aVAnd at her heels a huge infectious troop
p25776
aVOf pale distemperatures and foes to life
p25777
aVIn food in sport and life-preserving rest
p25778
aVTo be disturbed would mad or man or beast
p25779
aVThe consequence is then thy jealous fits
p25780
aVHath scared thy husband from the use of wits
p25781
aVShe never reprehended him but mildly
p25782
aVWhen he demeaned himself rough rude and wildly
p25783
aVWhy bear you these rebukes and answer not
p25784
aVShe did betray me to my own reproof
p25785
aVGood people enter and lay hold on him
p25786
aVNo not a creature enters in my house
p25787
aVThen let your servants bring my husband forth
p25788
aVNeither He took this place for sanctuary
p25789
aVAnd it shall privilege him from your hands
p25790
aVTill I have brought him to his wits again
p25791
aVOr lose my labor in assaying it
p25792
aVI will attend my husband be his nurse
p25793
aVDiet his sickness for it is my office
p25794
aVAnd will have no attorney but myself

p25797
aVTill I have used the approvèd means I have
p25798
aVWith wholesome syrups drugs and holy prayers
p25799
aVTo make of him a formal man again
p25800
aVIt is a branch and parcel of mine oath
p25801
aVA charitable duty of my order
p25802
aVTherefore depart and leave him here with me
p25803
aVI will not hence and leave my husband here
p25804
aVAnd ill it doth beseem your holiness
p25805
aVTo separate the husband and the wife
p25806
aVBe quiet and depart Thou shalt not have him
p25807
aVComplain unto the Duke of this indignity
p25808
aVCome go I will fall prostrate at his feet
p25809
aVAnd never rise until my tears and prayers
p25810
aVHave won his grace to come in person hither
p25811
aVAnd take perforce my husband from the Abbess
p25812
aVBy this I think the dial points at five
p25813
aVAnon I\u2019m sure the Duke himself in person
p25814
aVComes this way to the melancholy vale
p25815
aVThe place of death and sorry execution
p25816
aVBehind the ditches of the abbey here
p25817
aVUpon what cause
p25818
aVTo see a reverend Syracusian merchant
p25819
aVWho put unluckily into this bay
p25820
aVAgainst the laws and statutes of this town
p25821
aVBeheaded publicly for his offense
p25822
aVSee where they come We will behold his death
p25823
aVKneel to the Duke before he pass the abbey
p25824
aVYet once again proclaim it publicly
p25825
aVIf any friend will pay the sum for him
p25826
aVHe shall not die so much we tender him

aVJustice most sacred duke against the Abbess
p25828
aVShe is a virtuous and a reverend lady
p25829
aVIt cannot be that she hath done thee wrong
p25830
aVMay it please your Grace Antipholus my husband
p25831
aVWho I made lord of me and all I had
p25832
aVAt your important letters this ill day
p25833
aVA most outrageous fit of madness took him
p25834
aVThat desp\u2019rately he hurried through the street
p25835
aVWith him his bondman all as mad as he
p25836
aVDoing displeasure to the citizens
p25837
aVBy rushing in their houses bearing thence
p25838
aVRings jewels anything his rage did like
p25839
aVOnce did I get him bound and sent him home
p25840
aVWhilst to take order for the wrongs I went
p25841
aVThat here and there his fury had committed
p25842
aVAnon I wot not by what strong escape
p25843
aVHe broke from those that had the guard of him
p25844
aVAnd with his mad attendant and himself
p25845
aVEach one with ireful passion with drawn swords
p25846
aVMet us again and madly bent on us
p25847
aVChased us away till raising of more aid
p25848
aVWe came again to bind them Then they fled
p25849
aVInto this abbey whither we pursued them
p25850
aVAnd here the Abbess shuts the gates on us
p25851
aVAnd will not suffer us to fetch him out
p25852
aVNor send him forth that we may bear him hence
p25853
aVTherefore most gracious duke with thy command
p25854
aVLet him be brought forth and borne hence for help
p25855
aVLong since thy husband served me in my wars
p25856
aVAnd I to thee engaged a prince\u2019s word
p25857
aVWhen thou didst make him master of thy bed
p25858
aVTo do him all the grace and good I could
p25859
aVGo some of you knock at the abbey gate
p25860
aVAnd bid the Lady Abbess come to me
p25861
aVI will determine this before I stir

p25866
aVAnd ever as it blazed they threw on him
p25867
aVGreat pails of puddled mire to quench the hair
p25868
aVMy master preaches patience to him and the while
p25869
aVHis man with scissors nicks him like a fool
p25870
aVAnd sure unless you send some present help
p25871
aVBetween them they will kill the conjurer

aVWhere Balthasar and I did dine together
p25918
aVOur dinner done and he not coming thither
p25919
aVI went to seek him In the street I met him
p25920
aVAnd in his company that gentleman
p25921
aVThere did this perjured goldsmith swear me down
p25922
aVThat I this day of him received the chain
p25923
aVWhich God He knows I saw not for the which
p25924
aVHe did arrest me with an officer

aVFull fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights

p26182
aVNor never Hydra-headed willfulness
p26183
aVSo soon did lose his seat and all at once
p26184
aVAs in this king
p26185
aVWe are blessèd in the change
p26186
aVHear him but reason in divinity
p26187
aVAnd all-admiring with an inward wish
p26188
aVYou would desire the King were made a prelate
p26189
aVHear him debate of commonwealth affairs
p26190
aVYou would say it hath been all in all his study
p26191
aVList his discourse of war and you shall hear
p26192
aVA fearful battle rendered you in music
p26193
aVTurn him to any cause of policy
p26194
aVThe Gordian knot of it he will unloose
p26195
aVFamiliar as his garter that when he speaks
p26196
aVThe air a chartered libertine is still
p26197
aVAnd the mute wonder lurketh in men\u2019s ears
p26198
aVTo steal his sweet and honeyed sentences
p26199
aVSo that the art and practic part of life
p26200
aVMust be the mistress to this theoric
p26201
aVWhich is a wonder how his Grace should glean it
p26202
aVSince his addiction was to courses vain
p26203
aVHis companies unlettered rude and shallow
p26204
aVHis hours filled up with riots banquets sports
p26205
aVAnd never noted in him any study
p26206
aVAny retirement any sequestration
p26207
aVFrom open haunts and popularity
p26208
aVThe strawberry grows underneath the nettle
p26209
aVAnd wholesome berries thrive and ripen best
p26210
aVNeighbored by fruit of baser quality
p26211
aVAnd so the Prince obscured his contemplation
p26212
aVUnder the veil of wildness which no doubt
p26213
aVGrew like the summer grass fastest by night
p26214
aVUnseen yet crescive in his faculty
p26215
aVIt must be so for miracles are ceased
p26216
aVAnd therefore we must needs admit the means
p26217
aVHow things are perfected
p26218
aVBut my good lord
p26219
aVHow now for mitigation of this bill
p26220
aVUrged by the Commons Doth his Majesty
p26221
aVIncline to it or no
p26222
aVHe seems indifferent
p26223
aVOr rather swaying more upon our part
p26224
aVThan cherishing th\u2019 exhibitors against us
p26225
aVFor I have made an offer to his Majesty
p26226
aVUpon our spiritual convocation
p26227
aVAnd in regard of causes now in hand
p26228
aVWhich I have opened to his Grace at large
p26229
aVAs touching France to give a greater sum
p26230
aVThan ever at one time the clergy yet
p26231
aVDid to his predecessors part withal
p26232
aVHow did this offer seem received my lord
p26233
aVWith good acceptance of his Majesty
p26234
aVSave that there was not time enough to hear
p26235
aVAs I perceived his Grace would fain have done
p26236
aVThe severals and unhidden passages
p26237
aVOf his true titles to some certain dukedoms
p26238
aVAnd generally to the crown and seat of France
p26239
aVDerived from Edward his great-grandfather
p26240
aVWhat was th\u2019 impediment that broke this off
p26241
aVThe French ambassador upon that instant
p26242
aVCraved audience And the hour I think is come
p26243
aVTo give him hearing Is it four o\u2019clock
p26244
aVIt is
p26245
aVThen go we in to know his embassy
p26246
aVWhich I could with a ready guess declare
p26247
aVBefore the Frenchman speak a word of it
p26248
aVI\u2019ll wait upon you and I long to hear it
p26249
aVWhere is my gracious Lord of Canterbury
p26250
aVNot here in presence
p26251
aVSend for him good uncle
p26252
aVShall we call in th\u2019 Ambassador my liege
p26253
aVNot yet my cousin We would be resolved
p26254
aVBefore we hear him of some things of weight
p26255
aVThat task our thoughts concerning us and France
p26256
aVGod and his angels guard your sacred throne
p26257
aVAnd make you long become it
p26258
aVSure we thank you
p26259
aVMy learnèd lord we pray you to proceed
p26260
aVAnd justly and religiously unfold
p26261
aVWhy the law Salic that they have in France
p26262
aVOr should or should not bar us in our claim
p26263
aVAnd God forbid my dear and faithful lord
p26264
aVThat you should fashion wrest or bow your reading
p26265
aVOr nicely charge your understanding soul
p26266
aVWith opening titles miscreate whose right
p26267
aVSuits not in native colors with the truth
p26268
aVFor God doth know how many now in health
p26269
aVShall drop their blood in approbation
p26270
aVOf what your reverence shall incite us to
p26271
aVTherefore take heed how you impawn our person
p26272
aVHow you awake our sleeping sword of war
p26273
aVWe charge you in the name of God take heed
p26274
aVFor never two such kingdoms did contend
p26275
aVWithout much fall of blood whose guiltless drops
p26276
aVAre every one a woe a sore complaint
p26277
aV\u2019Gainst him whose wrongs gives edge unto the swords
p26278
aVThat makes such waste in brief mortality
p26279
aVUnder this conjuration speak my lord
p26280
aVFor we will hear note and believe in heart
p26281
aVThat what you speak is in your conscience washed
p26282
aVAs pure as sin with baptism
p26283
aVThen hear me gracious sovereign and you peers
p26284
aVThat owe yourselves your lives and services
p26285
aVTo this imperial throne There is no bar
p26286
aVTo make against your Highness\u2019 claim to France
p26287
aVBut this which they produce from Pharamond
p26288
aVIn terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant
p26289
aVNo woman shall succeed in Salic land
p26290
aVWhich Salic land the French unjustly gloze
p26291
aVTo be the realm of France and Pharamond
p26292
aVThe founder of this law and female bar
p26293
aVYet their own authors faithfully affirm
p26294
aVThat the land Salic is in Germany
p26295
aVBetween the floods of Sala and of Elbe
p26296
aVWhere Charles the Great having subdued the Saxons
p26297
aVThere left behind and settled certain French
p26298
aVWho holding in disdain the German women
p26299
aVFor some dishonest manners of their life
p26300
aVEstablished then this law to wit no female
p26301
aVShould be inheritrix in Salic land
p26302
aVWhich Salic as I said \u2019twixt Elbe and Sala
p26303
aVIs at this day in Germany called Meissen
p26304
aVThen doth it well appear the Salic law
p26305
aVWas not devisèd for the realm of France
p26306
aVNor did the French possess the Salic land
p26307
aVUntil four hundred one and twenty years
p26308
aVAfter defunction of King Pharamond
p26309
aVIdly supposed the founder of this law
p26310
aVWho died within the year of our redemption
p26311
aVFour hundred twenty-six and Charles the Great
p26312
aVSubdued the Saxons and did seat the French
p26313
aVBeyond the river Sala in the year
p26314
aVEight hundred five Besides their writers say
p26315
aVKing Pepin which deposèd Childeric
p26316
aVDid as heir general being descended
p26317
aVOf Blithild which was daughter to King Clothair
p26318
aVMake claim and title to the crown of France
p26319
aVHugh Capet also who usurped the crown
p26320
aVOf Charles the Duke of Lorraine sole heir male
p26321
aVOf the true line and stock of Charles the Great
p26322
aVTo find his title with some shows of truth
p26323
aVThough in pure truth it was corrupt and naught
p26324
aVConveyed himself as th\u2019 heir to th\u2019 Lady Lingare
p26325
aVDaughter to Charlemagne who was the son
p26326
aVTo Lewis the Emperor and Lewis the son
p26327
aVOf Charles the Great Also King Lewis the Tenth
p26328
aVWho was sole heir to the usurper Capet
p26329
aVCould not keep quiet in his conscience
p26330
aVWearing the crown of France till satisfied
p26331
aVThat fair Queen Isabel his grandmother
p26332
aVWas lineal of the Lady Ermengare
p26333
aVDaughter to Charles the foresaid Duke of Lorraine
p26334
aVBy the which marriage the line of Charles the Great
p26335
aVWas reunited to the crown of France
p26336
aVSo that as clear as is the summer\u2019s sun
p26337
aVKing Pepin\u2019s title and Hugh Capet\u2019s claim
p26338
aVKing Lewis his satisfaction all appear
p26339
aVTo hold in right and title of the female
p26340
aVSo do the kings of France unto this day
p26341
aVHowbeit they would hold up this Salic law
p26342
aVTo bar your Highness claiming from the female
p26343
aVAnd rather choose to hide them in a net
p26344
aVThan amply to imbar their crooked titles
p26345
aVUsurped from you and your progenitors
p26346
aVMay I with right and conscience make this claim
p26347
aVThe sin upon my head dread sovereign
p26348
aVFor in the Book of Numbers is it writ
p26349
aVWhen the man dies let the inheritance
p26350
aVDescend unto the daughter Gracious lord
p26351
aVStand for your own unwind your bloody flag
p26352
aVLook back into your mighty ancestors
p26353
aVGo my dread lord to your great-grandsire\u2019s tomb
p26354
aVFrom whom you claim invoke his warlike spirit
p26355
aVAnd your great-uncle\u2019s Edward the Black Prince
p26356
aVWho on the French ground played a tragedy
p26357
aVMaking defeat on the full power of France
p26358
aVWhiles his most mighty father on a hill
p26359
aVStood smiling to behold his lion\u2019s whelp
p26360
aVForage in blood of French nobility
p26361
aVO noble English that could entertain
p26362
aVWith half their forces the full pride of France
p26363
aVAnd let another half stand laughing by
p26364
aVAll out of work and cold for action
p26365
aVAwake remembrance of these valiant dead
p26366
aVAnd with your puissant arm renew their feats
p26367
aVYou are their heir you sit upon their throne
p26368
aVThe blood and courage that renownèd them
p26369
aVRuns in your veins and my thrice-puissant liege
p26370
aVIs in the very May-morn of his youth
p26371
aVRipe for exploits and mighty enterprises
p26372
aVYour brother kings and monarchs of the Earth
p26373
aVDo all expect that you should rouse yourself
p26374
aVAs did the former lions of your blood
p26375
aVThey know your Grace hath cause and means and might
p26376
aVSo hath your Highness Never king of England
p26377
aVHad nobles richer and more loyal subjects
p26378
aVWhose hearts have left their bodies here in England
p26379
aVAnd lie pavilioned in the fields of France
p26380
aVO let their bodies follow my dear liege
p26381
aVWith blood and sword and fire to win your right
p26382
aVIn aid whereof we of the spiritualty
p26383
aVWill raise your Highness such a mighty sum
p26384
aVAs never did the clergy at one time
p26385
aVBring in to any of your ancestors
p26386
aVWe must not only arm t\u2019 invade the French
p26387
aVBut lay down our proportions to defend
p26388
aVAgainst the Scot who will make road upon us
p26389
aVWith all advantages
p26390
aVThey of those marches gracious sovereign
p26391
aVShall be a wall sufficient to defend
p26392
aVOur inland from the pilfering borderers
p26393
aVWe do not mean the coursing snatchers only
p26394
aVBut fear the main intendment of the Scot
p26395
aVWho hath been still a giddy neighbor to us
p26396
aVFor you shall read that my great-grandfather
p26397
aVNever went with his forces into France
p26398
aVBut that the Scot on his unfurnished kingdom
p26399
aVCame pouring like the tide into a breach
p26400
aVWith ample and brim fullness of his force
p26401
aVGalling the gleanèd land with hot assays
p26402
aVGirding with grievous siege castles and towns
p26403
aVThat England being empty of defense
p26404
aVHath shook and trembled at th\u2019 ill neighborhood
p26405
aVShe hath been then more feared than harmed my liege
p26406
aVFor hear her but exampled by herself
p26407
aVWhen all her chivalry hath been in France
p26408
aVAnd she a mourning widow of her nobles
p26409
aVShe hath herself not only well defended
p26410
aVBut taken and impounded as a stray
p26411
aVThe King of Scots whom she did send to France
p26412
aVTo fill King Edward\u2019s fame with prisoner kings
p26413
aVAnd make her chronicle as rich with praise
p26414
aVAs is the ooze and bottom of the sea
p26415
aVWith sunken wrack and sumless treasuries
p26416
aVBut there\u2019s a saying very old and true
p26417
aVIf that you will France win
p26418
aVThen with Scotland first begin
p26419
aVFor once the eagle England being in prey
p26420
aVTo her unguarded nest the weasel Scot
p26421
aVComes sneaking and so sucks her princely eggs
p26422
aVPlaying the mouse in absence of the cat
p26423
aVTo \u2019tame and havoc more than she can eat
p26424
aVIt follows then the cat must stay at home
p26425
aVYet that is but a crushed necessity
p26426
aVSince we have locks to safeguard necessaries
p26427
aVAnd pretty traps to catch the petty thieves
p26428
aVWhile that the armèd hand doth fight abroad
p26429
aVTh\u2019 advisèd head defends itself at home
p26430
aVFor government though high and low and lower
p26431
aVPut into parts doth keep in one consent
p26432
aVCongreeing in a full and natural close
p26433
aVLike music
p26434
aVTherefore doth heaven divide
p26435
aVThe state of man in divers functions
p26436
aVSetting endeavor in continual motion
p26437
aVTo which is fixèd as an aim or butt
p26438
aVObedience for so work the honeybees
p26439
aVCreatures that by a rule in nature teach
p26440
aVThe act of order to a peopled kingdom
p26441
aVThey have a king and officers of sorts
p26442
aVWhere some like magistrates correct at home
p26443
aVOthers like merchants venture trade abroad
p26444
aVOthers like soldiers armèd in their stings
p26445
aVMake boot upon the summer\u2019s velvet buds
p26446
aVWhich pillage they with merry march bring home
p26447
aVTo the tent royal of their emperor
p26448
aVWho busied in his majesty surveys
p26449
aVThe singing masons building roofs of gold
p26450
aVThe civil citizens kneading up the honey
p26451
aVThe poor mechanic porters crowding in
p26452
aVTheir heavy burdens at his narrow gate
p26453
aVThe sad-eyed justice with his surly hum
p26454
aVDelivering o\u2019er to executors pale
p26455
aVThe lazy yawning drone I this infer
p26456
aVThat many things having full reference
p26457
aVTo one consent may work contrariously
p26458
aVAs many arrows loosèd several ways
p26459
aVCome to one mark as many ways meet in one town
p26460
aVAs many fresh streams meet in one salt sea
p26461
aVAs many lines close in the dial\u2019s center
p26462
aVSo may a thousand actions once afoot
p26463
aVEnd in one purpose and be all well borne
p26464
aVWithout defeat Therefore to France my liege
p26465
aVDivide your happy England into four
p26466
aVWhereof take you one quarter into France
p26467
aVAnd you withal shall make all Gallia shake
p26468
aVIf we with thrice such powers left at home
p26469
aVCannot defend our own doors from the dog
p26470
aVLet us be worried and our nation lose
p26471
aVThe name of hardiness and policy
p26472
aVCall in the messengers sent from the Dauphin
p26473
aVNow are we well resolved and by God\u2019s help
p26474
aVAnd yours the noble sinews of our power
p26475
aVFrance being ours we\u2019ll bend it to our awe
p26476
aVOr break it all to pieces Or there we\u2019ll sit
p26477
aVRuling in large and ample empery
p26478
aVO\u2019er France and all her almost kingly dukedoms
p26479
aVOr lay these bones in an unworthy urn
p26480
aVTombless with no remembrance over them
p26481
aVEither our history shall with full mouth
p26482
aVSpeak freely of our acts or else our grave
p26483
aVLike Turkish mute shall have a tongueless mouth
p26484
aVNot worshiped with a waxen epitaph
p26485
aVNow are we well prepared to know the pleasure
p26486
aVOf our fair cousin Dauphin for we hear
p26487
aVYour greeting is from him not from the King
p26488
aVMay \u2019t please your Majesty to give us leave
p26489
aVFreely to render what we have in charge
p26490
aVOr shall we sparingly show you far off
p26491
aVThe Dauphin\u2019s meaning and our embassy
p26492
aVWe are no tyrant but a Christian king
p26493
aVUnto whose grace our passion is as subject
p26494
aVAs is our wretches fettered in our prisons
p26495
aVTherefore with frank and with uncurbèd plainness
p26496
aVTell us the Dauphin\u2019s mind
p26497
aVThus then in few
p26498
aVYour Highness lately sending into France
p26499
aVDid claim some certain dukedoms in the right
p26500
aVOf your great predecessor King Edward the Third
p26501
aVIn answer of which claim the Prince our master
p26502
aVSays that you savor too much of your youth
p26503
aVAnd bids you be advised there\u2019s naught in France
p26504
aVThat can be with a nimble galliard won
p26505
aVYou cannot revel into dukedoms there
p26506
aVHe therefore sends you meeter for your spirit
p26507
aVThis tun of treasure and in lieu of this
p26508
aVDesires you let the dukedoms that you claim
p26509
aVHear no more of you This the Dauphin speaks
p26510
aVWhat treasure uncle
p26511
aVTennis balls my liege
p26512
aVWe are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us
p26513
aVHis present and your pains we thank you for
p26514
aVWhen we have matched our rackets to these balls
p26515
aVWe will in France by God\u2019s grace play a set
p26516
aVShall strike his father\u2019s crown into the hazard
p26517
aVTell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler
p26518
aVThat all the courts of France will be disturbed
p26519
aVWith chases And we understand him well
p26520
aVHow he comes o\u2019er us with our wilder days
p26521
aVNot measuring what use we made of them
p26522
aVWe never valued this poor seat of England
p26523
aVAnd therefore living hence did give ourself
p26524
aVTo barbarous license as \u2019tis ever common
p26525
aVThat men are merriest when they are from home
p26526
aVBut tell the Dauphin I will keep my state
p26527
aVBe like a king and show my sail of greatness
p26528
aVWhen I do rouse me in my throne of France
p26529
aVFor that I have laid by my majesty
p26530
aVAnd plodded like a man for working days
p26531
aVBut I will rise there with so full a glory
p26532
aVThat I will dazzle all the eyes of France
p26533
aVYea strike the Dauphin blind to look on us
p26534
aVAnd tell the pleasant prince this mock of his
p26535
aVHath turned his balls to gun-stones and his soul
p26536
aVShall stand sore chargèd for the wasteful vengeance
p26537
aVThat shall fly with them for many a thousand widows
p26538
aVShall this his mock mock out of their dear husbands
p26539
aVMock mothers from their sons mock castles down
p26540
aVAnd some are yet ungotten and unborn
p26541
aVThat shall have cause to curse the Dauphin\u2019s scorn
p26542
aVBut this lies all within the will of God
p26543
aVTo whom I do appeal and in whose name
p26544
aVTell you the Dauphin I am coming on
p26545
aVTo venge me as I may and to put forth
p26546
aVMy rightful hand in a well-hallowed cause
p26547
aVSo get you hence in peace And tell the Dauphin
p26548
aVHis jest will savor but of shallow wit
p26549
aVWhen thousands weep more than did laugh at it
p26550
aVConvey them with safe conduct Fare you well
p26551
aVThis was a merry message
p26552
aVWe hope to make the sender blush at it
p26553
aVTherefore my lords omit no happy hour
p26554
aVThat may give furth\u2019rance to our expedition
p26555
aVFor we have now no thought in us but France
p26556
aVSave those to God that run before our business
p26557
aVTherefore let our proportions for these wars
p26558
aVBe soon collected and all things thought upon
p26559
aVThat may with reasonable swiftness add
p26560
aVMore feathers to our wings For God before
p26561
aVWe\u2019ll chide this Dauphin at his father\u2019s door
p26562
aVTherefore let every man now task his thought
p26563
aVThat this fair action may on foot be brought
p26564
aVNow all the youth of England are on fire
p26565
aVAnd silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies
p26566
aVNow thrive the armorers and honor\u2019s thought
p26567
aVReigns solely in the breast of every man
p26568
aVThey sell the pasture now to buy the horse
p26569
aVFollowing the mirror of all Christian kings
p26570
aVWith wingèd heels as English Mercurys
p26571
aVFor now sits Expectation in the air
p26572

aVThe King hath note of all that they intend

p26620
aVHis sovereign\u2019s life to death and treachery

aVNow sits the wind fair and we will aboard

aVMy Lord of Cambridge and my kind Lord of Masham

aVWill cut their passage through the force of France
p26626
aVDoing the execution and the act
p26627
aVFor which we have in head assembled them
p26628
aVNo doubt my liege if each man do his best

aVI doubt not that since we are well persuaded
p26630
aVWe carry not a heart with us from hence

aVNor leave not one behind that doth not wish

aVWe judge no less Uncle of Exeter

aVEnlarge the man committed yesterday
p26650
aVThat railed against our person We consider
p26651
aVIt was excess of wine that set him on
p26652
aVAnd on his more advice we pardon him
p26653
aVThat\u2019s mercy but too much security
p26654
aVLet him be punished sovereign lest example

aVShall not be winked at how shall we stretch our eye

aVWhen capital crimes chewed swallowed and digested

aVAppear before us We\u2019ll yet enlarge that man

aVThough Cambridge Scroop and Grey in their dear care

aVSo much complexion Look you how they change
p26682
aVTheir cheeks are paper Why what read you there

aVThat have so cowarded and chased your blood

aVI do confess my fault

aVAnd do submit me to your Highness\u2019 mercy
p26687
aVTo which we all appeal
p26688
aVThe mercy that was quick in us but late
p26689
aVBy your own counsel is suppressed and killed
p26690
aVYou must not dare for shame to talk of mercy
p26691
aVFor your own reasons turn into your bosoms
p26692
aVAs dogs upon their masters worrying you
p26693
aVSee you my princes and my noble peers
p26694
aVThese English monsters My Lord of Cambridge here
p26695
aVYou know how apt our love was to accord
p26696
aVTo furnish him with all appurtenants
p26697
aVBelonging to his honor and this man
p26698
aVHath for a few light crowns lightly conspired
p26699
aVAnd sworn unto the practices of France
p26700
aVTo kill us here in Hampton to the which
p26701
aVThis knight no less for bounty bound to us
p26702
aVThan Cambridge is hath likewise sworn But O
p26703
aVWhat shall I say to thee Lord Scroop thou cruel
p26704
aVIngrateful savage and inhuman creature
p26705
aVThou that didst bear the key of all my counsels
p26706
aVThat knew\u2019st the very bottom of my soul
p26707
aVThat almost mightst have coined me into gold
p26708
aVWouldst thou have practiced on me for thy use
p26709
aVMay it be possible that foreign hire
p26710
aVCould out of thee extract one spark of evil
p26711
aVThat might annoy my finger \u2019Tis so strange
p26712
aVThat though the truth of it stands off as gross
p26713
aVAs black and white my eye will scarcely see it
p26714
aVTreason and murder ever kept together
p26715
aVAs two yoke-devils sworn to either\u2019s purpose
p26716
aVWorking so grossly in a natural cause
p26717
aVThat admiration did not whoop at them
p26718
aVBut thou \u2019gainst all proportion didst bring in
p26719
aVWonder to wait on treason and on murder
p26720
aVAnd whatsoever cunning fiend it was
p26721
aVThat wrought upon thee so preposterously
p26722
aVHath got the voice in hell for excellence
p26723
aVAll other devils that suggest by treasons
p26724
aVDo botch and bungle up damnation
p26725
aVWith patches colors and with forms being fetched
p26726
aVFrom glist\u2019ring semblances of piety
p26727
aVBut he that tempered thee bade thee stand up
p26728
aVGave thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason
p26729
aVUnless to dub thee with the name of traitor
p26730
aVIf that same demon that hath gulled thee thus
p26731
aVShould with his lion gait walk the whole world
p26732
aVHe might return to vasty Tartar back
p26733
aVAnd tell the legions I can never win
p26734
aVA soul so easy as that Englishman\u2019s
p26735
aVO how hast thou with jealousy infected
p26736
aVThe sweetness of affiance Show men dutiful
p26737
aVWhy so didst thou Seem they grave and learnèd
p26738
aVWhy so didst thou Come they of noble family
p26739
aVWhy so didst thou Seem they religious
p26740
aVWhy so didst thou Or are they spare in diet
p26741
aVFree from gross passion or of mirth or anger
p26742
aVConstant in spirit not swerving with the blood
p26743
aVGarnished and decked in modest complement
p26744
aVNot working with the eye without the ear
p26745
aVAnd but in purgèd judgment trusting neither
p26746
aVSuch and so finely bolted didst thou seem
p26747
aVAnd thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot
p26748
aVTo mark the full-fraught man and best endued
p26749
aVWith some suspicion I will weep for thee
p26750
aVFor this revolt of thine methinks is like
p26751
aVAnother fall of man Their faults are open
p26752
aVArrest them to the answer of the law
p26753
aVAnd God acquit them of their practices
p26754
aVOur purposes God justly hath discovered
p26755
aVAnd I repent my fault more than my death
p26756
aVWhich I beseech your Highness to forgive
p26757
aVAlthough my body pay the price of it
p26758
aVFor me the gold of France did not seduce
p26759
aVAlthough I did admit it as a motive
p26760
aVThe sooner to effect what I intended
p26761
aVBut God be thankèd for prevention
p26762
aVWhich I in sufferance heartily will rejoice
p26763
aVBeseeching God and you to pardon me
p26764
aVNever did faithful subject more rejoice
p26765
aVAt the discovery of most dangerous treason
p26766
aVThan I do at this hour joy o\u2019er myself
p26767
aVPrevented from a damnèd enterprise
p26768
aVMy fault but not my body pardon sovereign
p26769
aVGod quit you in His mercy Hear your sentence
p26770
aVYou have conspired against our royal person
p26771
aVJoined with an enemy proclaimed and from his coffers
p26772
aVReceived the golden earnest of our death
p26773
aVWherein you would have sold your king to slaughter
p26774
aVHis princes and his peers to servitude
p26775
aVHis subjects to oppression and contempt
p26776
aVAnd his whole kingdom into desolation
p26777
aVTouching our person seek we no revenge
p26778
aVBut we our kingdom\u2019s safety must so tender
p26779
aVWhose ruin you have sought that to her laws
p26780
aVWe do deliver you Get you therefore hence
p26781
aVPoor miserable wretches to your death
p26782
aVThe taste whereof God of His mercy give
p26783
aVYou patience to endure and true repentance
p26784
aVOf all your dear offenses Bear them hence
p26785
aVNow lords for France the enterprise whereof
p26786
aVShall be to you as us like glorious
p26787
aVWe doubt not of a fair and lucky war
p26788
aVSince God so graciously hath brought to light
p26789
aVThis dangerous treason lurking in our way
p26790
aVTo hinder our beginnings We doubt not now
p26791
aVBut every rub is smoothèd on our way
p26792
aVThen forth dear countrymen Let us deliver
p26793
aVOur puissance into the hand of God
p26794
aVPutting it straight in expedition
p26795
aVCheerly to sea The signs of war advance
p26796
aVNo king of England if not king of France
p26797
aVThus comes the English with full power upon us
p26798
aVAnd more than carefully it us concerns
p26799
aVTo answer royally in our defenses
p26800
aVTherefore the Dukes of Berri and of Brittany
p26801
aVOf Brabant and of Orléans shall make forth
p26802
aVAnd you Prince Dauphin with all swift dispatch
p26803
aVTo line and new-repair our towns of war
p26804
aVWith men of courage and with means defendant
p26805
aVFor England his approaches makes as fierce
p26806
aVAs waters to the sucking of a gulf
p26807
aVIt fits us then to be as provident
p26808
aVAs fear may teach us out of late examples
p26809
aVLeft by the fatal and neglected English
p26810
aVUpon our fields
p26811
aVMy most redoubted father
p26812
aVIt is most meet we arm us \u2019gainst the foe
p26813
aVFor peace itself should not so dull a kingdom
p26814
aVThough war nor no known quarrel were in question
p26815
aVBut that defenses musters preparations
p26816
aVShould be maintained assembled and collected
p26817
aVAs were a war in expectation
p26818
aVTherefore I say \u2019tis meet we all go forth
p26819
aVTo view the sick and feeble parts of France
p26820
aVAnd let us do it with no show of fear
p26821
aVNo with no more than if we heard that England
p26822
aVWere busied with a Whitsun morris-dance
p26823
aVFor my good liege she is so idly kinged
p26824
aVHer scepter so fantastically borne
p26825
aVBy a vain giddy shallow humorous youth
p26826
aVThat fear attends her not
p26827
aVO peace Prince Dauphin
p26828
aVYou are too much mistaken in this king
p26829
aVQuestion your Grace the late ambassadors
p26830
aVWith what great state he heard their embassy
p26831
aVHow well supplied with noble councillors
p26832
aVHow modest in exception and withal
p26833
aVHow terrible in constant resolution
p26834
aVAnd you shall find his vanities forespent
p26835
aVWere but the outside of the Roman Brutus
p26836
aVCovering discretion with a coat of folly
p26837
aVAs gardeners do with ordure hide those roots
p26838
aVThat shall first spring and be most delicate
p26839
aVWell \u2019tis not so my Lord High Constable
p26840
aVBut though we think it so it is no matter
p26841
aVIn cases of defense \u2019tis best to weigh
p26842
aVThe enemy more mighty than he seems
p26843
aVSo the proportions of defense are filled
p26844
aVWhich of a weak and niggardly projection
p26845
aVDoth like a miser spoil his coat with scanting
p26846
aVA little cloth
p26847
aVThink we King Harry strong
p26848
aVAnd princes look you strongly arm to meet him
p26849
aVThe kindred of him hath been fleshed upon us
p26850
aVAnd he is bred out of that bloody strain
p26851
aVThat haunted us in our familiar paths
p26852
aVWitness our too-much-memorable shame
p26853
aVWhen Cressy battle fatally was struck
p26854
aVAnd all our princes captived by the hand
p26855
aVOf that black name Edward Black Prince of Wales
p26856
aVWhiles that his mountain sire on mountain standing
p26857
aVUp in the air crowned with the golden sun

p26860
aVThe patterns that by God and by French fathers
p26861

p26865
aVDo crave admittance to your Majesty
p26866
aVWe\u2019ll give them present audience Go and bring them
p26867
aVYou see this chase is hotly followed friends
p26868
aVTurn head and stop pursuit for coward dogs
p26869
aVMost spend their mouths when what they seem to threaten
p26870
aVRuns far before them Good my sovereign
p26871
aVTake up the English short and let them know
p26872
aVOf what a monarchy you are the head
p26873
aVSelf-love my liege is not so vile a sin
p26874
aVAs self-neglecting
p26875
aVFrom our brother of England
p26876
aVFrom him and thus he greets your Majesty
p26877
aVHe wills you in the name of God almighty
p26878
aVThat you divest yourself and lay apart
p26879
aVThe borrowed glories that by gift of heaven
p26880
aVBy law of nature and of nations \u2019longs
p26881
aVTo him and to his heirs namely the crown
p26882
aVAnd all wide-stretchèd honors that pertain
p26883
aVBy custom and the ordinance of times
p26884
aVUnto the crown of France That you may know
p26885
aV\u2019Tis no sinister nor no awkward claim
p26886
aVPicked from the wormholes of long-vanished days
p26887
aVNor from the dust of old oblivion raked
p26888
aVHe sends you this most memorable line
p26889
aVIn every branch truly demonstrative
p26890
aVWilling you overlook this pedigree
p26891
aVAnd when you find him evenly derived
p26892
aVFrom his most famed of famous ancestors
p26893
aVEdward the Third he bids you then resign
p26894
aVYour crown and kingdom indirectly held
p26895
aVFrom him the native and true challenger
p26896
aVOr else what follows
p26897
aVBloody constraint for if you hide the crown
p26898
aVEven in your hearts there will he rake for it
p26899
aVTherefore in fierce tempest is he coming
p26900
aVIn thunder and in earthquake like a Jove
p26901
aVThat if requiring fail he will compel
p26902
aVAnd bids you in the bowels of the Lord
p26903
aVDeliver up the crown and to take mercy
p26904
aVOn the poor souls for whom this hungry war
p26905
aVOpens his vasty jaws and on your head
p26906
aVTurning the widows\u2019 tears the orphans\u2019 cries
p26907
aVThe dead men\u2019s blood the privèd maidens\u2019 groans
p26908
aVFor husbands fathers and betrothèd lovers
p26909
aVThat shall be swallowed in this controversy
p26910
aVThis is his claim his threat\u2019ning and my message
p26911
aVUnless the Dauphin be in presence here
p26912
aVTo whom expressly I bring greeting too
p26913
aVFor us we will consider of this further
p26914
aVTomorrow shall you bear our full intent
p26915
aVBack to our brother of England

p26925
aVThat caves and womby vaultages of France
p26926
aVShall chide your trespass and return your mock
p26927
aVIn second accent of his ordinance
p26928
aVSay if my father render fair return
p26929
aVIt is against my will for I desire
p26930
aVNothing but odds with England To that end
p26931
aVAs matching to his youth and vanity

aVA night is but small breath and little pause

aVHark how our steeds for present service neigh

aVMount them and make incision in their hides
p27366
aVThat their hot blood may spin in English eyes
p27367
aVAnd dout them with superfluous courage Ha

aVTo horse you gallant princes straight to horse
p27372
aVDo but behold yond poor and starvèd band

p27374
aVLeaving them but the shales and husks of men
p27375
aVThere is not work enough for all our hands
p27376
aVScarce blood enough in all their sickly veins
p27377
aVTo give each naked curtal ax a stain
p27378
aVThat our French gallants shall today draw out
p27379
aVAnd sheathe for lack of sport Let us but blow on them
p27380
aVThe vapor of our valor will o\u2019erturn them
p27381
aV\u2019Tis positive against all exceptions lords
p27382
aVThat our superfluous lackeys and our peasants
p27383
aVWho in unnecessary action swarm
p27384
aVAbout our squares of battle were enough
p27385
aVTo purge this field of such a hilding foe
p27386
aVThough we upon this mountain\u2019s basis by
p27387
aVTook stand for idle speculation
p27388
aVBut that our honors must not What\u2019s to say

aVTheir ragged curtains poorly are let loose
p27398
aVAnd our air shakes them passing scornfully
p27399
aVBig Mars seems bankrupt in their beggared host
p27400
aVAnd faintly through a rusty beaver peeps
p27401
aVThe horsemen sit like fixèd candlesticks
p27402
aVWith torch staves in their hand and their poor jades
p27403
aVLob down their heads drooping the hides and hips
p27404
aVThe gum down-roping from their pale dead eyes
p27405
aVAnd in their pale dull mouths the gemeled bit

aVFly o\u2019er them all impatient for their hour
p27409
aVDescription cannot suit itself in words
p27410
aVTo demonstrate the life of such a battle
p27411
aVIn life so lifeless as it shows itself
p27412
aVThey have said their prayers and they stay for death
p27413
aVShall we go send them dinners and fresh suits

aVAnd give their fasting horses provender
p27415
aVAnd after fight with them

aVThis day is called the feast of Crispian

aVGod\u2019s will my liege would you and I alone

aVThou needs must be englutted Besides in mercy
p27504
aVThe Constable desires thee thou wilt mind

aVThy followers of repentance that their souls
p27506
aVMay make a peaceful and a sweet retire

aVThe man that once did sell the lion\u2019s skin
p27515
aVWhile the beast lived was killed with hunting him
p27516
aVA many of our bodies shall no doubt
p27517
aVFind native graves upon the which I trust

aVAnd those that leave their valiant bones in France
p27520
aVDying like men though buried in your dunghills
p27521
aVThey shall be famed for there the sun shall greet them
p27522
aVAnd draw their honors reeking up to heaven
p27523
aVLeaving their earthly parts to choke your clime
p27524
aVThe smell whereof shall breed a plague in France
p27525
aVMark then abounding valor in our English
p27526
aVThat being dead like to the bullet\u2019s crazing

p27528
aVKilling in relapse of mortality

aVLet me speak proudly tell the Constable
p27530
aVWe are but warriors for the working day
p27531
aVOur gayness and our gilt are all besmirched
p27532
aVWith rainy marching in the painful field
p27533
aVThere\u2019s not a piece of feather in our host
p27534
aVGood argument I hope we will not fly
p27535
aVAnd time hath worn us into slovenry
p27536
aVBut by the Mass our hearts are in the trim
p27537
aVAnd my poor soldiers tell me yet ere night
p27538
aVThey\u2019ll be in fresher robes or they will pluck
p27539
aVThe gay new coats o\u2019er the French soldiers\u2019 heads
p27540
aVAnd turn them out of service If they do this
p27541
aVAs if God please they shall my ransom then
p27542
aVWill soon be levied Herald save thou thy labor
p27543
aVCome thou no more for ransom gentle herald
p27544
aVThey shall have none I swear but these my joints

aVHis fairest daughter is contaminate
p27572
aVDisorder that hath spoiled us friend us now
p27573
aVLet us on heaps go offer up our lives
p27574
aVWe are enough yet living in the field
p27575
aVTo smother up the English in our throngs
p27576
aVIf any order might be thought upon
p27577
aVThe devil take order now I\u2019ll to the throng
p27578
aVLet life be short else shame will be too long
p27579
aVWell have we done thrice-valiant countrymen
p27580
aVBut all\u2019s not done Yet keep the French the field
p27581
aVThe Duke of York commends him to your Majesty
p27582
aVLives he good uncle Thrice within this hour
p27583
aVI saw him down thrice up again and fighting
p27584
aVFrom helmet to the spur all blood he was
p27585
aVIn which array brave soldier doth he lie
p27586
aVLarding the plain and by his bloody side
p27587
aVYoke-fellow to his honor-owing wounds
p27588
aVThe noble Earl of Suffolk also lies
p27589
aVSuffolk first died and York all haggled over
p27590
aVComes to him where in gore he lay insteeped
p27591
aVAnd takes him by the beard kisses the gashes
p27592
aVThat bloodily did yawn upon his face
p27593
aVHe cries aloud Tarry my cousin Suffolk
p27594
aVMy soul shall thine keep company to heaven
p27595
aVTarry sweet soul for mine then fly abreast
p27596
aVAs in this glorious and well-foughten field
p27597
aVWe kept together in our chivalry
p27598
aVUpon these words I came and cheered him up
p27599
aVHe smiled me in the face raught me his hand
p27600
aVAnd with a feeble grip says Dear my lord
p27601
aVCommend my service to my sovereign
p27602
aVSo did he turn and over Suffolk\u2019s neck
p27603
aVHe threw his wounded arm and kissed his lips
p27604
aVAnd so espoused to death with blood he sealed
p27605
aVA testament of noble-ending love
p27606
aVThe pretty and sweet manner of it forced
p27607
aVThose waters from me which I would have stopped
p27608
aVBut I had not so much of man in me
p27609
aVAnd all my mother came into mine eyes
p27610
aVAnd gave me up to tears
p27611
aVI blame you not
p27612
aVFor hearing this I must perforce compound
p27613
aVWith my full eyes or they will issue too
p27614
aVBut hark what new alarum is this same

p27622
aVOr void the field They do offend our sight
p27623
aVIf they\u2019ll do neither we will come to them
p27624
aVAnd make them skirr away as swift as stones
p27625
aVEnforcèd from the old Assyrian slings
p27626
aVBesides we\u2019ll cut the throats of those we have
p27627
aVAnd not a man of them that we shall take
p27628
aVShall taste our mercy Go and tell them so
p27629
aVHere comes the herald of the French my liege

aVHis eyes are humbler than they used to be
p27631
aVHow now what means this herald Know\u2019st thou not
p27632
aVThat I have fined these bones of mine for ransom
p27633
aVCom\u2019st thou again for ransom
p27634
aVNo great king

aVI come to thee for charitable license
p27636
aVThat we may wander o\u2019er this bloody field
p27637
aVTo book our dead and then to bury them
p27638
aVTo sort our nobles from our common men
p27639
aVFor many of our princes woe the while
p27640
aVLie drowned and soaked in mercenary blood
p27641
aVSo do our vulgar drench their peasant limbs
p27642
aVIn blood of princes and the wounded steeds

aVYerk out their armèd heels at their dead masters

aVThe devil speed him No man\u2019s pie is freed
p28030
aVFrom his ambitious finger What had he
p28031
aVTo do in these fierce vanities I wonder

aVThat such a keech can with his very bulk

aVAnd keep it from the Earth
p28035
aVSurely sir

aVFor high feats done to th\u2019 crown neither allied
p28040
aVTo eminent assistants but spiderlike
p28041
aVOut of his self-drawing web he gives us note
p28042
aVThe force of his own merit makes his way
p28043
aVA gift that heaven gives for him which buys
p28044
aVA place next to the King
p28045
aVI cannot tell
p28046
aVWhat heaven hath given him let some graver eye
p28047
aVPierce into that but I can see his pride
p28048
aVPeep through each part of him Whence has he that
p28049
aVIf not from hell the devil is a niggard
p28050
aVOr has given all before and he begins
p28051
aVA new hell in himself
p28052
aVWhy the devil
p28053
aVUpon this French going-out took he upon him
p28054
aVWithout the privity o\u2019 th\u2019 King t\u2019 appoint
p28055
aVWho should attend on him He makes up the file
p28056
aVOf all the gentry for the most part such
p28057

aVA most poor issue
p28070

p28071
aVThe peace between the French and us not values

aVEvery man
p28074
aVAfter the hideous storm that followed was

aVA thing inspired and not consulting broke
p28076
aVInto a general prophecy that this tempest
p28077
aVDashing the garment of this peace aboded
p28078
aVThe sudden breach on \u2019t
p28079
aVWhich is budded out
p28080
aVFor France hath flawed the league and hath attached
p28081
aVOur merchants\u2019 goods at Bordeaux

aVAnd take it from a heart that wishes towards you
p28093
aVHonor and plenteous safety that you read
p28094
aVThe Cardinal\u2019s malice and his potency
p28095
aVTogether to consider further that
p28096
aVWhat his high hatred would effect wants not

aVA minister in his power You know his nature
p28098
aVThat he\u2019s revengeful and I know his sword
p28099
aVHath a sharp edge it\u2019s long and \u2019t may be said
p28100
aVIt reaches far and where \u2019twill not extend

aVTo those which would not know them and yet must
p28290
aVPerforce be their acquaintance These exactions
p28291
aVWhereof my sovereign would have note they are

p28358
aVI am sorry that the Duke of Buckingham
p28359
aVIs run in your displeasure
p28360
aVIt grieves many
p28361
aVThe gentleman is learnèd and a most rare speaker
p28362
aVTo nature none more bound his training such
p28363
aVThat he may furnish and instruct great teachers
p28364
aVAnd never seek for aid out of himself Yet see
p28365
aVWhen these so noble benefits shall prove
p28366
aVNot well disposed the mind growing once corrupt
p28367
aVThey turn to vicious forms ten times more ugly
p28368
aVThan ever they were fair This man so complete
p28369
aVWho was enrolled \u2019mongst wonders and when we
p28370
aVAlmost with ravished list\u2019ning could not find
p28371
aVHis hour of speech a minute he my lady
p28372
aVHath into monstrous habits put the graces
p28373
aVThat once were his and is become as black

p28380
aVMost like a careful subject have collected
p28381
aVOut of the Duke of Buckingham
p28382
aVSpeak freely
p28383
aVFirst it was usual with him every day
p28384
aVIt would infect his speech that if the King
p28385
aVShould without issue die he\u2019ll carry it so
p28386
aVTo make the scepter his These very words
p28387
aVI\u2019ve heard him utter to his son-in-law
p28388
aVLord Abergavenny to whom by oath he menaced
p28389
aVRevenge upon the Cardinal
p28390
aVPlease your Highness note
p28391
aVThis dangerous conception in this point
p28392
aVNot friended by his wish to your high person
p28393
aVHis will is most malignant and it stretches
p28394
aVBeyond you to your friends
p28395
aVMy learnèd Lord Cardinal
p28396
aVDeliver all with charity
p28397
aVSpeak on
p28398
aVHow grounded he his title to the crown
p28399
aVUpon our fail To this point hast thou heard him
p28400
aVAt any time speak aught
p28401
aVHe was brought to this
p28402
aVBy a vain prophecy of Nicholas Henton
p28403
aVWhat was that Henton
p28404
aVSir a Chartreux friar
p28405
aVHis confessor who fed him every minute
p28406
aVWith words of sovereignty
p28407
aVHow know\u2019st thou this
p28408
aVNot long before your Highness sped to France
p28409
aVThe Duke being at the Rose within the parish
p28410
aVSaint Laurence Poultney did of me demand
p28411
aVWhat was the speech among the Londoners
p28412
aVConcerning the French journey I replied
p28413
aVMen fear the French would prove perfidious
p28414
aVTo the King\u2019s danger Presently the Duke
p28415
aVSaid \u2019twas the fear indeed and that he doubted
p28416
aV\u2019Twould prove the verity of certain words
p28417
aVSpoke by a holy monk that oft says he
p28418
aVHath sent to me wishing me to permit
p28419
aVJohn de la Car my chaplain a choice hour
p28420
aVTo hear from him a matter of some moment
p28421
aVWhom after under the confession\u2019s seal
p28422
aVHe solemnly had sworn that what he spoke
p28423
aVMy chaplain to no creature living but
p28424
aVTo me should utter with demure confidence
p28425
aVThis pausingly ensued Neither the King nor \u2019s heirs
p28426
aVTell you the Duke shall prosper Bid him strive
p28427
aVTo gain the love o\u2019 th\u2019 commonalty the Duke
p28428
aVShall govern England
p28429
aVIf I know you well

aVLet him on
p28436
aVGo forward
p28437
aVOn my soul I\u2019ll speak but truth
p28438
aVI told my lord the Duke by th\u2019 devil\u2019s illusions
p28439
aVThe monk might be deceived and that \u2019twas dangerous
p28440
aVFor him to ruminate on this so far until
p28441
aVIt forged him some design which being believed
p28442
aVIt was much like to do He answered Tush
p28443
aVIt can do me no damage adding further
p28444
aVThat had the King in his last sickness failed
p28445
aVThe Cardinal\u2019s and Sir Thomas Lovell\u2019s heads
p28446
aVShould have gone off
p28447

aVIf quoth he I for this had been committed
p28457
aVAs to the Tower I thought I would have played
p28458

p28460
aVMade suit to come in \u2019s presence which if granted
p28461

p28469
aVHe stretched him and with one hand on his dagger
p28470
aVAnother spread on \u2019s breast mounting his eyes
p28471
aVHe did discharge a horrible oath whose tenor
p28472
aVWas were he evil used he would outgo
p28473
aVHis father by as much as a performance
p28474
aVDoes an irresolute purpose
p28475
aVThere\u2019s his period

aVA fit or two o\u2019 th\u2019 face but they are shrewd ones

p28706
aVOf the great Duke of Buckingham
p28707
aVI\u2019ll save you
p28708
aVThat labor sir All\u2019s now done but the ceremony
p28709
aVOf bringing back the prisoner
p28710
aVWere you there
p28711
aVYes indeed was I
p28712
aVPray speak what has happened
p28713
aVYou may guess quickly what
p28714
aVIs he found guilty
p28715
aVYes truly is he and condemned upon \u2019t
p28716
aVI am sorry for \u2019t
p28717
aVSo are a number more
p28718
aVBut pray how passed it
p28719
aVI\u2019ll tell you in a little The great duke
p28720
aVCame to the bar where to his accusations
p28721
aVHe pleaded still not guilty and alleged
p28722
aVMany sharp reasons to defeat the law
p28723
aVThe King\u2019s attorney on the contrary
p28724
aVUrged on the examinations proofs confessions
p28725
aVOf divers witnesses which the Duke desired
p28726
aVTo him brought viva voce to his face
p28727
aVAt which appeared against him his surveyor
p28728
aVSir Gilbert Peck his chancellor and John Car
p28729
aVConfessor to him with that devil monk
p28730
aVHopkins that made this mischief
p28731
aVThat was he
p28732
aVThat fed him with his prophecies
p28733
aVThe same
p28734
aVAll these accused him strongly which he fain
p28735
aVWould have flung from him but indeed he could not
p28736
aVAnd so his peers upon this evidence
p28737
aVHave found him guilty of high treason Much
p28738
aVHe spoke and learnèdly for life but all
p28739
aVWas either pitied in him or forgotten
p28740
aVAfter all this how did he bear himself
p28741
aVWhen he was brought again to th\u2019 bar to hear
p28742
aVHis knell rung out his judgment he was stirred
p28743
aVWith such an agony he sweat extremely
p28744
aVAnd something spoke in choler ill and hasty
p28745
aVBut he fell to himself again and sweetly
p28746
aVIn all the rest showed a most noble patience
p28747
aVI do not think he fears death
p28748
aVSure he does not
p28749
aVHe never was so womanish The cause
p28750
aVHe may a little grieve at
p28751
aVCertainly
p28752
aVThe Cardinal is the end of this
p28753
aV\u2019Tis likely
p28754
aVBy all conjectures first Kildare\u2019s attainder
p28755
aVThen Deputy of Ireland who removed
p28756
aVEarl Surrey was sent thither and in haste too
p28757
aVLest he should help his father
p28758
aVThat trick of state
p28759
aVWas a deep envious one
p28760
aVAt his return
p28761
aVNo doubt he will requite it This is noted
p28762
aVAnd generally whoever the King favors
p28763
aVThe Card\u2019nal instantly will find employment
p28764
aVAnd far enough from court too
p28765
aVAll the commons
p28766
aVHate him perniciously and o\u2019 my conscience
p28767
aVWish him ten fathom deep This duke as much
p28768
aVThey love and dote on call him bounteous Buckingham
p28769
aVThe mirror of all courtesy
p28770
aVStay there sir
p28771
aVAnd see the noble ruined man you speak of
p28772
aVLet\u2019s stand close and behold him
p28773
aVAll good people
p28774
aVYou that thus far have come to pity me
p28775
aVHear what I say and then go home and lose me
p28776
aVI have this day received a traitor\u2019s judgment
p28777
aVAnd by that name must die Yet heaven bear witness
p28778
aVAnd if I have a conscience let it sink me
p28779
aVEven as the ax falls if I be not faithful
p28780
aVThe law I bear no malice for my death
p28781
aV\u2019T has done upon the premises but justice
p28782
aVBut those that sought it I could wish more Christian
p28783
aVBe what they will I heartily forgive \u2019em
p28784
aVYet let \u2019em look they glory not in mischief
p28785
aVNor build their evils on the graves of great men
p28786
aVFor then my guiltless blood must cry against \u2019em
p28787
aVFor further life in this world I ne\u2019er hope
p28788
aVNor will I sue although the King have mercies
p28789
aVMore than I dare make faults You few that loved me
p28790
aVAnd dare be bold to weep for Buckingham
p28791
aVHis noble friends and fellows whom to leave
p28792
aVIs only bitter to him only dying
p28793
aVGo with me like good angels to my end
p28794
aVAnd as the long divorce of steel falls on me
p28795
aVMake of your prayers one sweet sacrifice
p28796
aVAnd lift my soul to heaven Lead on a\u2019 God\u2019s name
p28797
aVI do beseech your Grace for charity
p28798
aVIf ever any malice in your heart
p28799
aVWere hid against me now to forgive me frankly
p28800
aVSir Thomas Lovell I as free forgive you
p28801
aVAs I would be forgiven I forgive all
p28802
aVThere cannot be those numberless offenses
p28803
aV\u2019Gainst me that I cannot take peace with No black envy
p28804
aVShall make my grave Commend me to his Grace
p28805
aVAnd if he speak of Buckingham pray tell him
p28806
aVYou met him half in heaven My vows and prayers
p28807
aVYet are the King\u2019s and till my soul forsake
p28808
aVShall cry for blessings on him May he live
p28809
aVLonger than I have time to tell his years
p28810
aVEver beloved and loving may his rule be
p28811
aVAnd when old Time shall lead him to his end
p28812
aVGoodness and he fill up one monument
p28813
aVTo th\u2019 waterside I must conduct your Grace
p28814
aVThen give my charge up to Sir Nicholas Vaux
p28815
aVWho undertakes you to your end
p28816
aVPrepare there
p28817
aVThe Duke is coming See the barge be ready
p28818
aVAnd fit it with such furniture as suits
p28819
aVThe greatness of his person
p28820
aVNay Sir Nicholas
p28821
aVLet it alone My state now will but mock me
p28822
aVWhen I came hither I was Lord High Constable
p28823
aVAnd Duke of Buckingham now poor Edward Bohun
p28824
aVYet I am richer than my base accusers
p28825
aVThat never knew what truth meant I now seal it
p28826
aVAnd with that blood will make \u2019em one day groan for \u2019t
p28827
aVMy noble father Henry of Buckingham
p28828
aVWho first raised head against usurping Richard
p28829
aVFlying for succor to his servant Banister
p28830
aVBeing distressed was by that wretch betrayed
p28831
aVAnd without trial fell God\u2019s peace be with him
p28832
aVHenry the Seventh succeeding truly pitying
p28833
aVMy father\u2019s loss like a most royal prince
p28834
aVRestored me to my honors and out of ruins
p28835
aVMade my name once more noble Now his son
p28836
aVHenry the Eighth life honor name and all
p28837
aVThat made me happy at one stroke has taken
p28838
aVForever from the world I had my trial
p28839
aVAnd must needs say a noble one which makes me
p28840
aVA little happier than my wretched father
p28841
aVYet thus far we are one in fortunes both
p28842
aVFell by our servants by those men we loved most
p28843
aVA most unnatural and faithless service
p28844
aVHeaven has an end in all yet you that hear me
p28845
aVThis from a dying man receive as certain
p28846
aVWhere you are liberal of your loves and counsels
p28847
aVBe sure you be not loose for those you make friends
p28848
aVAnd give your hearts to when they once perceive
p28849
aVThe least rub in your fortunes fall away
p28850
aVLike water from you never found again
p28851
aVBut where they mean to sink you All good people
p28852
aVPray for me I must now forsake you The last hour
p28853
aVOf my long weary life is come upon me
p28854
aVFarewell And when you would say something that is sad
p28855
aVSpeak how I fell I have done and God forgive me
p28856
aVO this is full of pity sir It calls
p28857
aVI fear too many curses on their heads
p28858
aVThat were the authors
p28859
aVIf the Duke be guiltless
p28860
aV\u2019Tis full of woe Yet I can give you inkling
p28861
aVOf an ensuing evil if it fall
p28862
aVGreater than this
p28863
aVGood angels keep it from us
p28864
aVWhat may it be You do not doubt my faith sir
p28865
aVThis secret is so weighty \u2019twill require
p28866
aVA strong faith to conceal it
p28867
aVLet me have it
p28868
aVI do not talk much
p28869
aVI am confident
p28870
aVYou shall sir Did you not of late days hear
p28871
aVA buzzing of a separation
p28872
aVBetween the King and Katherine
p28873
aVYes but it held not
p28874
aVFor when the King once heard it out of anger
p28875
aVHe sent command to the Lord Mayor straight
p28876
aVTo stop the rumor and allay those tongues
p28877
aVThat durst disperse it
p28878
aVBut that slander sir
p28879
aVIs found a truth now for it grows again
p28880
aVFresher than e\u2019er it was and held for certain
p28881
aVThe King will venture at it Either the Cardinal
p28882
aVOr some about him near have out of malice
p28883
aVTo the good queen possessed him with a scruple
p28884
aVThat will undo her To confirm this too
p28885
aVCardinal Campeius is arrived and lately
p28886
aVAs all think for this business
p28887
aV\u2019Tis the Cardinal
p28888
aVAnd merely to revenge him on the Emperor
p28889
aVFor not bestowing on him at his asking
p28890
aVThe archbishopric of Toledo this is purposed
p28891
aVI think you have hit the mark But is \u2019t not cruel
p28892
aVThat she should feel the smart of this The Cardinal
p28893
aVWill have his will and she must fall
p28894
aV\u2019Tis woeful
p28895
aVWe are too open here to argue this
p28896
aVLet\u2019s think in private more
p28897
aVI fear he will indeed well let him have them
p28898
aVHe will have all I think
p28899
aVWell met my Lord Chamberlain
p28900
aVGood day to both your Graces
p28901
aVHow is the King employed
p28902
aVI left him private
p28903
aVFull of sad thoughts and troubles
p28904
aVWhat\u2019s the cause
p28905
aVIt seems the marriage with his brother\u2019s wife
p28906
aVHas crept too near his conscience
p28907
aVNo his conscience
p28908
aVHas crept too near another lady
p28909
aV\u2019Tis so
p28910
aVThis is the Cardinal\u2019s doing The king-cardinal
p28911
aVThat blind priest like the eldest son of Fortune
p28912
aVTurns what he list The King will know him one day
p28913
aVPray God he do He\u2019ll never know himself else
p28914
aVHow holily he works in all his business
p28915
aVAnd with what zeal For now he has cracked the league
p28916
aVBetween us and the Emperor the Queen\u2019s great-nephew
p28917
aVHe dives into the King\u2019s soul and there scatters
p28918
aVDangers doubts wringing of the conscience
p28919
aVFears and despairs and all these for his marriage
p28920
aVAnd out of all these to restore the King

p29334
aVInduce you to the question on \u2019t or ever

aVMy Lord Cardinal
p29340
aVI do excuse you yea upon mine honor
p29341

aVBark when their fellows do By some of these
p29345
aVThe Queen is put in anger You\u2019re excused
p29346
aVBut will you be more justified You ever
p29347
aVHave wished the sleeping of this business never desired
p29348
aVIt to be stirred but oft have hindered oft
p29349
aVThe passages made toward it On my honor
p29350
aVI speak my good Lord Cardinal to this point
p29351
aVAnd thus far clear him Now what moved me to \u2019t
p29352
aVI will be bold with time and your attention
p29353
aVThen mark th\u2019 inducement Thus it came give heed to \u2019t
p29354
aVMy conscience first received a tenderness
p29355
aVScruple and prick on certain speeches uttered
p29356
aVBy th\u2019 Bishop of Bayonne then French ambassador
p29357
aVWho had been hither sent on the debating
p29358
aVA marriage \u2019twixt the Duke of Orleans and
p29359
aVOur daughter Mary I\u2019 th\u2019 progress of this business
p29360
aVEre a determinate resolution he
p29361
aVI mean the Bishop did require a respite
p29362
aVWherein he might the King his lord advertise
p29363
aVWhether our daughter were legitimate
p29364
aVRespecting this our marriage with the dowager
p29365
aVSometime our brother\u2019s wife This respite shook
p29366
aVThe bosom of my conscience entered me
p29367
aVYea with a spitting power and made to tremble
p29368
aVThe region of my breast which forced such way
p29369
aVThat many mazed considerings did throng
p29370
aVAnd pressed in with this caution First methought
p29371
aVI stood not in the smile of heaven who had
p29372
aVCommanded nature that my lady\u2019s womb
p29373
aVIf it conceived a male child by me should
p29374
aVDo no more offices of life to \u2019t than
p29375
aVThe grave does to th\u2019 dead for her male issue
p29376
aVOr died where they were made or shortly after
p29377
aVThis world had aired them Hence I took a thought
p29378
aVThis was a judgment on me that my kingdom
p29379
aVWell worthy the best heir o\u2019 th\u2019 world should not
p29380
aVBe gladded in \u2019t by me Then follows that
p29381
aVI weighed the danger which my realms stood in
p29382
aVBy this my issue\u2019s fail and that gave to me
p29383
aVMany a groaning throe Thus hulling in
p29384
aVThe wild sea of my conscience I did steer
p29385
aVToward this remedy whereupon we are
p29386
aVNow present here together That\u2019s to say
p29387
aVI meant to rectify my conscience which
p29388
aVI then did feel full sick and yet not well
p29389
aVBy all the reverend fathers of the land
p29390
aVAnd doctors learnèd First I began in private
p29391
aVWith you my Lord of Lincoln You remember
p29392
aVHow under my oppression I did reek
p29393
aVWhen I first moved you
p29394
aVVery well my liege

aVI have spoke long Be pleased yourself to say
p29396
aVHow far you satisfied me
p29397
aVSo please your Highness
p29398
aVThe question did at first so stagger me
p29399
aVBearing a state of mighty moment in \u2019t
p29400
aVAnd consequence of dread that I committed
p29401
aVThe daring\u2019st counsel which I had to doubt
p29402
aVAnd did entreat your Highness to this course
p29403
aVWhich you are running here
p29404
aVI then moved you
p29405
aVMy Lord of Canterbury and got your leave
p29406
aVTo make this present summons Unsolicited
p29407
aVI left no reverend person in this court
p29408
aVBut by particular consent proceeded
p29409
aVUnder your hands and seals Therefore go on
p29410
aVFor no dislike i\u2019 th\u2019 world against the person
p29411
aVOf the good queen but the sharp thorny points
p29412
aVOf my allegèd reasons drives this forward
p29413
aVProve but our marriage lawful by my life
p29414
aVAnd kingly dignity we are contented
p29415
aVTo wear our mortal state to come with her
p29416

p29417
aVThat\u2019s paragoned o\u2019 th\u2019 world
p29418
aVSo please your Highness
p29419
aVThe Queen being absent \u2019tis a needful fitness
p29420
aVThat we adjourn this court till further day
p29421
aVMeanwhile must be an earnest motion
p29422
aVMade to the Queen to call back her appeal
p29423
aVShe intends unto his Holiness

p29425
aVThese cardinals trifle with me I abhor

aVSpeak on sir

aVI dare your worst objections If I blush
p29999
aVIt is to see a nobleman want manners
p30000
aVI had rather want those than my head Have at you
p30001
aVFirst that without the King\u2019s assent or knowledge
p30002
aVYou wrought to be a legate by which power
p30003
aVYou maimed the jurisdiction of all bishops
p30004
aVThen that in all you writ to Rome or else
p30005
aVTo foreign princes ego et rex meus
p30006
aVWas still inscribed in which you brought the King
p30007
aVTo be your servant
p30008
aVThen that without the knowledge
p30009
aVEither of king or council when you went
p30010
aVAmbassador to the Emperor you made bold
p30011
aVTo carry into Flanders the great seal
p30012
aVItem you sent a large commission
p30013
aVTo Gregory de Cassado to conclude
p30014
aVWithout the King\u2019s will or the state\u2019s allowance
p30015
aVA league between his Highness and Ferrara
p30016
aVThat out of mere ambition you have caused
p30017
aVYour holy hat to be stamped on the King\u2019s coin
p30018
aVThen that you have sent innumerable substance
p30019
aVBy what means got I leave to your own conscience
p30020
aVTo furnish Rome and to prepare the ways
p30021
aVYou have for dignities to the mere undoing
p30022
aVOf all the kingdom Many more there are

aVSo little of his great self
p30030
aVI forgive him
p30031
aVLord Cardinal the King\u2019s further pleasure is
p30032
aVBecause all those things you have done of late
p30033
aVBy your power legative within this kingdom
p30034
aVFall into th\u2019 compass of a praemunire
p30035
aVThat therefore such a writ be sued against you
p30036
aVTo forfeit all your goods lands tenements
p30037
aVChattels and whatsoever and to be
p30038
aVOut of the King\u2019s protection This is my charge
p30039
aVAnd so we\u2019ll leave you to your meditations
p30040
aVHow to live better For your stubborn answer
p30041
aVAbout the giving back the great seal to us
p30042
aVThe King shall know it and no doubt shall thank you

p30046
aVThis is the state of man today he puts forth
p30047
aVThe tender leaves of hopes tomorrow blossoms
p30048
aVAnd bears his blushing honors thick upon him
p30049
aVThe third day comes a frost a killing frost
p30050
aVAnd when he thinks good easy man full surely
p30051
aVHis greatness is a-ripening nips his root
p30052
aVAnd then he falls as I do I have ventured
p30053
aVLike little wanton boys that swim on bladders
p30054
aVThis many summers in a sea of glory
p30055
aVBut far beyond my depth My high-blown pride
p30056
aVAt length broke under me and now has left me
p30057
aVWeary and old with service to the mercy
p30058
aVOf a rude stream that must forever hide me
p30059
aVVain pomp and glory of this world I hate you
p30060
aVI feel my heart new opened O how wretched
p30061
aVIs that poor man that hangs on princes\u2019 favors
p30062
aVThere is betwixt that smile we would aspire to
p30063
aVThat sweet aspect of princes and their ruin
p30064
aVMore pangs and fears than wars or women have
p30065
aVAnd when he falls he falls like Lucifer
p30066
aVNever to hope again
p30067
aVWhy how now Cromwell
p30068
aVI have no power to speak sir
p30069
aVWhat amazed

aVI know myself now and I feel within me
p30077
aVA peace above all earthly dignities
p30078
aVA still and quiet conscience The King has cured me
p30079
aVI humbly thank his Grace and from these shoulders
p30080
aVThese ruined pillars out of pity taken
p30081
aVA load would sink a navy too much honor
p30082
aVO \u2019tis a burden Cromwell \u2019tis a burden
p30083
aVToo heavy for a man that hopes for heaven
p30084
aVI am glad your Grace has made that right use of it
p30085
aVI hope I have I am able now methinks
p30086
aVOut of a fortitude of soul I feel
p30087
aVTo endure more miseries and greater far
p30088
aVThan my weak-hearted enemies dare offer
p30089
aVWhat news abroad
p30090
aVThe heaviest and the worst
p30091
aVIs your displeasure with the King
p30092
aVGod bless him
p30093
aVThe next is that Sir Thomas More is chosen
p30094
aVLord Chancellor in your place
p30095
aVThat\u2019s somewhat sudden

aVThis day was viewed in open as his queen
p30108
aVGoing to chapel and the voice is now
p30109
aVOnly about her coronation

aVThere was the weight that pulled me down O Cromwell
p30111
aVThe King has gone beyond me All my glories
p30112
aVIn that one woman I have lost forever
p30113
aVNo sun shall ever usher forth mine honors

p30122
aVThy hopeful service perish too Good Cromwell

p30129
aVWith what a sorrow Cromwell leaves his lord
p30130
aVThe King shall have my service but my prayers
p30131
aVForever and forever shall be yours
p30132
aVCromwell I did not think to shed a tear
p30133
aVIn all my miseries but thou hast forced me
p30134
aVOut of thy honest truth to play the woman
p30135
aVLet\u2019s dry our eyes And thus far hear me Cromwell

aVAnd when I am forgotten as I shall be

aV\u2019Tis all my business At our last encounter
p30170
aVThe Duke of Buckingham came from his trial
p30171
aV\u2019Tis very true But that time offered sorrow
p30172
aVThis general joy
p30173
aV\u2019Tis well The citizens

aVI am sure have shown at full their royal minds
p30175
aVAs let \u2019em have their rights they are ever forward

aVPageants and sights of honor

aVNor I\u2019ll assure you better taken sir
p30180
aVMay I be bold to ask what that contains
p30181
aVThat paper in your hand
p30182
aVYes \u2019tis the list
p30183
aVOf those that claim their offices this day
p30184
aVBy custom of the coronation

aVThe Duke of Suffolk is the first and claims
p30186
aVTo be High Steward next the Duke of Norfolk
p30187
aVHe to be Earl Marshal You may read the rest
p30188
aVI thank you sir Had I not known those customs
p30189
aVI should have been beholding to your paper
p30190
aVBut I beseech you what\u2019s become of Katherine
p30191
aVThe Princess Dowager How goes her business
p30192
aVThat I can tell you too The Archbishop
p30193
aVOf Canterbury accompanied with other
p30194
aVLearnèd and reverend fathers of his order
p30195
aVHeld a late court at Dunstable six miles off
p30196
aVFrom Ampthill where the Princess lay to which
p30197
aVShe was often cited by them but appeared not
p30198
aVAnd to be short for not appearance and
p30199
aVThe King\u2019s late scruple by the main assent
p30200
aVOf all these learnèd men she was divorced
p30201
aVAnd the late marriage made of none effect
p30202
aVSince which she was removed to Kymmalton
p30203
aVWhere she remains now sick
p30204
aVAlas good lady
p30205
aVThe trumpets sound Stand close The Queen is coming
p30206
aVA royal train believe me These I know
p30207
aVWho\u2019s that that bears the scepter
p30208
aVMarques Dorset
p30209
aVAnd that the Earl of Surrey with the rod
p30210
aVA bold brave gentleman
p30211
aVThat should be
p30212
aVThe Duke of Suffolk
p30213
aV\u2019Tis the same High Steward
p30214
aVAnd that my Lord of Norfolk
p30215
aVYes
p30216
aVHeaven bless thee
p30217
aVThou hast the sweetest face I ever looked on
p30218
aVSir as I have a soul she is an angel
p30219
aVOur king has all the Indies in his arms
p30220
aVAnd more and richer when he strains that lady
p30221
aVI cannot blame his conscience
p30222
aVThey that bear
p30223
aVThe cloth of honor over her are four barons
p30224
aVOf the Cinque-ports
p30225
aVThose men are happy and so are all are near her
p30226
aVI take it she that carries up the train
p30227
aVIs that old noble lady Duchess of Norfolk
p30228
aVIt is and all the rest are countesses
p30229
aVTheir coronets say so These are stars indeed
p30230
aVAnd sometimes falling ones
p30231
aVNo more of that
p30232
aVGod save you sir Where have you been broiling
p30233
aVAmong the crowd i\u2019 th\u2019 Abbey where a finger
p30234
aVCould not be wedged in more I am stifled
p30235
aVWith the mere rankness of their joy
p30236
aVYou saw
p30237
aVThe ceremony
p30238
aVThat I did
p30239
aVHow was it
p30240
aVWell worth the seeing
p30241
aVGood sir speak it to us
p30242
aVAs well as I am able The rich stream
p30243
aVOf lords and ladies having brought the Queen
p30244
aVTo a prepared place in the choir fell off
p30245
aVA distance from her while her Grace sat down
p30246
aVTo rest awhile some half an hour or so
p30247
aVIn a rich chair of state opposing freely
p30248
aVThe beauty of her person to the people
p30249
aVBelieve me sir she is the goodliest woman
p30250
aVThat ever lay by man which when the people
p30251
aVHad the full view of such a noise arose
p30252
aVAs the shrouds make at sea in a stiff tempest
p30253
aVAs loud and to as many tunes Hats cloaks
p30254
aVDoublets I think flew up and had their faces
p30255
aVBeen loose this day they had been lost Such joy
p30256
aVI never saw before Great-bellied women
p30257
aVThat had not half a week to go like rams
p30258
aVIn the old time of war would shake the press
p30259
aVAnd make \u2019em reel before \u2019em No man living
p30260
aVCould say This is my wife there all were woven
p30261
aVSo strangely in one piece
p30262
aVBut what followed
p30263
aVAt length her Grace rose and with modest paces
p30264
aVCame to the altar where she kneeled and saintlike
p30265
aVCast her fair eyes to heaven and prayed devoutly
p30266
aVThen rose again and bowed her to the people
p30267
aVWhen by the Archbishop of Canterbury
p30268
aVShe had all the royal makings of a queen
p30269
aVAs holy oil Edward Confessor\u2019s crown
p30270
aVThe rod and bird of peace and all such emblems
p30271
aVLaid nobly on her which performed the choir
p30272
aVWith all the choicest music of the kingdom
p30273
aVTogether sung Te Deum So she parted
p30274
aVAnd with the same full state paced back again
p30275
aVTo York Place where the feast is held
p30276
aVSir
p30277
aVYou must no more call it York Place that\u2019s past
p30278
aVFor since the Cardinal fell that title\u2019s lost
p30279
aV\u2019Tis now the King\u2019s and called Whitehall
p30280
aVI know it
p30281
aVBut \u2019tis so lately altered that the old name
p30282
aVIs fresh about me
p30283
aVWhat two reverend bishops
p30284
aVWere those that went on each side of the Queen
p30285
aVStokeley and Gardiner the one of Winchester
p30286
aVNewly preferred from the King\u2019s secretary
p30287
aVThe other London
p30288
aVHe of Winchester
p30289
aVIs held no great good lover of the Archbishop\u2019s
p30290
aVThe virtuous Cranmer
p30291
aVAll the land knows that
p30292
aVHowever yet there is no great breach When it comes
p30293
aVCranmer will find a friend will not shrink from him
p30294
aVWho may that be I pray you
p30295
aVThomas Cromwell
p30296
aVA man in much esteem with th\u2019 King and truly
p30297
aVA worthy friend The King has made him
p30298
aVMaster o\u2019 th\u2019 Jewel House
p30299
aVAnd one already of the Privy Council
p30300
aVHe will deserve more
p30301
aVYes without all doubt
p30302
aVCome gentlemen you shall go my way
p30303
aVWhich is to th\u2019 court and there you shall be my guests
p30304
aVSomething I can command As I walk thither
p30305
aVI\u2019ll tell you more
p30306
aVYou may command us sir
p30307
aVHow does your Grace
p30308
aVO Griffith sick to death
p30309
aVMy legs like loaden branches bow to th\u2019 earth
p30310
aVWilling to leave their burden Reach a chair
p30311
aVSo Now methinks I feel a little ease
p30312
aVDidst thou not tell me Griffith as thou ledst me
p30313
aVThat the great child of honor Cardinal Wolsey
p30314
aVWas dead
p30315
aVYes madam but I think your Grace
p30316
aVOut of the pain you suffered gave no ear to \u2019t
p30317
aVPrithee good Griffith tell me how he died
p30318
aVIf well he stepped before me happily
p30319
aVFor my example
p30320
aVWell the voice goes madam
p30321
aVFor after the stout Earl Northumberland
p30322
aVArrested him at York and brought him forward
p30323
aVAs a man sorely tainted to his answer
p30324
aVHe fell sick suddenly and grew so ill
p30325
aVHe could not sit his mule
p30326
aVAlas poor man
p30327
aVAt last with easy roads he came to Leicester
p30328
aVLodged in the abbey where the reverend abbot
p30329
aVWith all his convent honorably received him
p30330
aVTo whom he gave these words O Father Abbot
p30331
aVAn old man broken with the storms of state
p30332
aVIs come to lay his weary bones among you
p30333
aVGive him a little earth for charity
p30334
aVSo went to bed where eagerly his sickness
p30335
aVPursued him still and three nights after this
p30336
aVAbout the hour of eight which he himself
p30337
aVForetold should be his last full of repentance
p30338
aVContinual meditations tears and sorrows
p30339
aVHe gave his honors to the world again
p30340
aVHis blessèd part to heaven and slept in peace
p30341
aVSo may he rest His faults lie gently on him
p30342
aVYet thus far Griffith give me leave to speak him
p30343
aVAnd yet with charity He was a man
p30344
aVOf an unbounded stomach ever ranking
p30345
aVHimself with princes one that by suggestion
p30346
aVTied all the kingdom Simony was fair play
p30347
aVHis own opinion was his law I\u2019 th\u2019 presence
p30348
aVHe would say untruths and be ever double
p30349
aVBoth in his words and meaning He was never
p30350
aVBut where he meant to ruin pitiful
p30351
aVHis promises were as he then was mighty
p30352
aVBut his performance as he is now nothing
p30353
aVOf his own body he was ill and gave
p30354
aVThe clergy ill example
p30355
aVNoble madam
p30356
aVMen\u2019s evil manners live in brass their virtues
p30357
aVWe write in water May it please your Highness
p30358
aVTo hear me speak his good now
p30359
aVYes good Griffith
p30360
aVI were malicious else
p30361
aVThis cardinal
p30362
aVThough from an humble stock undoubtedly
p30363
aVWas fashioned to much honor From his cradle
p30364
aVHe was a scholar and a ripe and good one
p30365
aVExceeding wise fair-spoken and persuading
p30366
aVLofty and sour to them that loved him not
p30367
aVBut to those men that sought him sweet as summer
p30368
aVAnd though he were unsatisfied in getting
p30369
aVWhich was a sin yet in bestowing madam
p30370
aVHe was most princely Ever witness for him
p30371
aVThose twins of learning that he raised in you
p30372
aVIpswich and Oxford one of which fell with him
p30373
aVUnwilling to outlive the good that did it
p30374
aVThe other though unfinished yet so famous
p30375
aVSo excellent in art and still so rising
p30376
aVThat Christendom shall ever speak his virtue
p30377
aVHis overthrow heaped happiness upon him
p30378
aVFor then and not till then he felt himself
p30379
aVAnd found the blessedness of being little
p30380
aVAnd to add greater honors to his age
p30381
aVThan man could give him he died fearing God
p30382
aVAfter my death I wish no other herald
p30383
aVNo other speaker of my living actions
p30384
aVTo keep mine honor from corruption
p30385
aVBut such an honest chronicler as Griffith
p30386
aVWhom I most hated living thou hast made me
p30387
aVWith thy religious truth and modesty
p30388
aVNow in his ashes honor Peace be with him
p30389
aVPatience be near me still and set me lower
p30390
aVI have not long to trouble thee Good Griffith
p30391
aVCause the musicians play me that sad note
p30392
aVI named my knell whilst I sit meditating
p30393
aVOn that celestial harmony I go to
p30394
aVShe is asleep Good wench let\u2019s sit down quiet
p30395
aVFor fear we wake her Softly gentle Patience
p30396
aVSpirits of peace where are you Are you all gone
p30397
aVAnd leave me here in wretchedness behind you

p30404
aVCast thousand beams upon me like the sun
p30405
aVThey promised me eternal happiness
p30406
aVAnd brought me garlands Griffith which I feel
p30407
aVI am not worthy yet to wear I shall assuredly
p30408
aVI am most joyful madam such good dreams
p30409
aVPossess your fancy

aVThey are harsh and heavy to me

aVDo you note
p30413
aVHow much her Grace is altered on the sudden
p30414
aVHow long her face is drawn How pale she looks
p30415
aVAnd of an earthy cold Mark her eyes

aVShe is going wench Pray pray
p30417
aVHeaven comfort her

aVKnowing she will not lose her wonted greatness

aVTo use so rude behavior Go to Kneel

aVI humbly do entreat your Highness\u2019 pardon

p30443
aVAnd heartily entreats you take good comfort
p30444
aVO my good lord that comfort comes too late
p30445
aV\u2019Tis like a pardon after execution
p30446
aVThat gentle physic given in time had cured me
p30447
aVBut now I am past all comforts here but prayers
p30448
aVHow does his Highness

aVI hope she will deserve well and a little
p30464
aVTo love her for her mother\u2019s sake that loved him
p30465
aVHeaven knows how dearly My next poor petition
p30466
aVIs that his noble Grace would have some pity
p30467
aVUpon my wretched women that so long

p30477
aVThat they may have their wages duly paid \u2019em
p30478
aVAnd something over to remember me by
p30479
aVIf heaven had pleased to have given me longer life
p30480
aVAnd able means we had not parted thus
p30481
aVThese are the whole contents And good my lord

aVHa \u2019Tis he indeed
p30745
aVIs this the honor they do one another
p30746
aV\u2019Tis well there\u2019s one above \u2019em yet I had thought
p30747
aVThey had parted so much honesty among \u2019em
p30748
aVAt least good manners as not thus to suffer
p30749
aVA man of his place and so near our favor
p30750
aVTo dance attendance on their Lordships\u2019 pleasures
p30751
aVAnd at the door too like a post with packets

p30758
aVThe chief cause concerns his Grace of Canterbury
p30759
aVHas he had knowledge of it
p30760
aVYes
p30761
aVWho waits there
p30762
aVWithout my noble lords
p30763
aVYes

aVMy lord Archbishop
p30765
aVAnd has done half an hour to know your pleasures
p30766
aVLet him come in
p30767
aVYour Grace may enter now
p30768
aVMy good lord Archbishop I\u2019m very sorry
p30769
aVTo sit here at this present and behold
p30770
aVThat chair stand empty But we all are men
p30771
aVIn our own natures frail and capable
p30772
aVOf our flesh few are angels out of which frailty
p30773
aVAnd want of wisdom you that best should teach us
p30774
aVHave misdemeaned yourself and not a little
p30775
aVToward the King first then his laws in filling
p30776
aVThe whole realm by your teaching and your chaplains\u2019
p30777
aVFor so we are informed with new opinions
p30778
aVDivers and dangerous which are heresies
p30779
aVAnd not reformed may prove pernicious
p30780
aVWhich reformation must be sudden too
p30781
aVMy noble lords for those that tame wild horses
p30782
aVPace \u2019em not in their hands to make \u2019em gentle
p30783
aVBut stop their mouths with stubborn bits and spur \u2019em
p30784
aVTill they obey the manage If we suffer
p30785
aVOut of our easiness and childish pity
p30786
aVTo one man\u2019s honor this contagious sickness
p30787
aVFarewell all physic And what follows then
p30788
aVCommotions uproars with a general taint
p30789
aVOf the whole state as of late days our neighbors
p30790
aVThe upper Germany can dearly witness
p30791
aVYet freshly pitied in our memories
p30792
aVMy good lords hitherto in all the progress
p30793
aVBoth of my life and office I have labored
p30794
aVAnd with no little study that my teaching
p30795
aVAnd the strong course of my authority
p30796
aVMight go one way and safely and the end
p30797
aVWas ever to do well Nor is there living
p30798
aVI speak it with a single heart my lords
p30799
aVA man that more detests more stirs against
p30800
aVBoth in his private conscience and his place
p30801
aVDefacers of a public peace than I do
p30802
aVPray heaven the King may never find a heart
p30803
aVWith less allegiance in it Men that make
p30804
aVEnvy and crookèd malice nourishment
p30805
aVDare bite the best I do beseech your Lordships
p30806
aVThat in this case of justice my accusers
p30807
aVBe what they will may stand forth face to face
p30808
aVAnd freely urge against me
p30809
aVNay my lord
p30810
aVThat cannot be You are a councillor
p30811
aVAnd by that virtue no man dare accuse you
p30812
aVMy lord because we have business of more moment
p30813
aVWe will be short with you \u2019Tis his Highness\u2019 pleasure
p30814
aVAnd our consent for better trial of you
p30815
aVFrom hence you be committed to the Tower
p30816
aVWhere being but a private man again
p30817
aVYou shall know many dare accuse you boldly
p30818
aVMore than I fear you are provided for
p30819
aVAh my good Lord of Winchester I thank you
p30820
aVYou are always my good friend If your will pass
p30821
aVI shall both find your Lordship judge and juror
p30822
aVYou are so merciful I see your end
p30823
aV\u2019Tis my undoing Love and meekness lord
p30824
aVBecome a churchman better than ambition
p30825
aVWin straying souls with modesty again
p30826
aVCast none away That I shall clear myself
p30827
aVLay all the weight you can upon my patience
p30828
aVI make as little doubt as you do conscience
p30829
aVIn doing daily wrongs I could say more
p30830
aVBut reverence to your calling makes me modest
p30831
aVMy lord my lord you are a sectary
p30832
aVThat\u2019s the plain truth Your painted gloss discovers
p30833
aVTo men that understand you words and weakness
p30834
aVMy Lord of Winchester you\u2019re a little
p30835
aVBy your good favor too sharp Men so noble
p30836
aVHowever faulty yet should find respect
p30837
aVFor what they have been \u2019Tis a cruelty
p30838
aVTo load a falling man
p30839
aVGood Master Secretary
p30840
aVI cry your Honor mercy you may worst
p30841
aVOf all this table say so
p30842
aVWhy my lord
p30843
aVDo not I know you for a favorer
p30844
aVOf this new sect You are not sound
p30845
aVNot sound
p30846
aVNot sound I say
p30847
aVWould you were half so honest
p30848
aVMen\u2019s prayers then would seek you not their fears
p30849
aVI shall remember this bold language
p30850
aVDo
p30851
aVRemember your bold life too
p30852
aVThis is too much
p30853
aVForbear for shame my lords
p30854
aVI have done
p30855
aVAnd I
p30856
aVThen thus for you my lord it stands agreed
p30857
aVI take it by all voices that forthwith
p30858
aVYou be conveyed to th\u2019 Tower a prisoner
p30859
aVThere to remain till the King\u2019s further pleasure
p30860
aVBe known unto us Are you all agreed lords
p30861
aVWe are
p30862
aVIs there no other way of mercy
p30863
aVBut I must needs to th\u2019 Tower my lords
p30864
aVWhat other
p30865
aVWould you expect You are strangely troublesome
p30866
aVLet some o\u2019 th\u2019 guard be ready there
p30867
aVFor me
p30868
aVMust I go like a traitor thither
p30869
aVReceive him
p30870
aVAnd see him safe i\u2019 th\u2019 Tower
p30871
aVStay good my lords
p30872
aVI have a little yet to say Look there my lords
p30873
aVBy virtue of that ring I take my cause
p30874
aVOut of the grips of cruel men and give it
p30875
aVTo a most noble judge the King my master
p30876
aVThis is the King\u2019s ring
p30877
aV\u2019Tis no counterfeit
p30878
aV\u2019Tis the right ring by heaven I told you all
p30879
aVWhen we first put this dangerous stone a-rolling
p30880
aV\u2019Twould fall upon ourselves
p30881
aVDo you think my lords
p30882
aVThe King will suffer but the little finger
p30883
aVOf this man to be vexed
p30884
aV\u2019Tis now too certain
p30885
aVHow much more is his life in value with him
p30886
aVWould I were fairly out on \u2019t
p30887
aVMy mind gave me
p30888
aVIn seeking tales and informations

p30893
aVIn daily thanks that gave us such a prince
p30894
aVNot only good and wise but most religious
p30895
aVOne that in all obedience makes the Church
p30896
aVThe chief aim of his honor and to strengthen
p30897
aVThat holy duty out of dear respect
p30898
aVHis royal self in judgment comes to hear
p30899
aVThe cause betwixt her and this great offender
p30900
aVYou were ever good at sudden commendations
p30901
aVBishop of Winchester But know I come not
p30902
aVTo hear such flattery now and in my presence
p30903
aVThey are too thin and base to hide offenses
p30904
aVTo me you cannot reach You play the spaniel
p30905
aVAnd think with wagging of your tongue to win me
p30906
aVBut whatsoe\u2019er thou tak\u2019st me for I\u2019m sure

aVThou hast a cruel nature and a bloody

aVHe that dares most but wag his finger at thee

p30913
aVMay it please your Grace

aVNo sir it does not please me
p30915
aVI had thought I had had men of some understanding
p30916
aVAnd wisdom of my Council but I find none
p30917
aVWas it discretion lords to let this man
p30918
aVThis good man few of you deserve that title
p30919
aVThis honest man wait like a lousy footboy
p30920
aVAt chamber door And one as great as you are

aVBid you so far forget yourselves I gave you
p30923
aVPower as he was a councillor to try him
p30924
aVNot as a groom There\u2019s some of you I see
p30925
aVMore out of malice than integrity
p30926
aVWould try him to the utmost had you mean
p30927
aVWhich you shall never have while I live
p30928
aVThus far
p30929
aVMy most dread sovereign may it like your Grace
p30930
aVTo let my tongue excuse all What was purposed
p30931
aVConcerning his imprisonment was rather
p30932
aVIf there be faith in men meant for his trial
p30933
aVAnd fair purgation to the world than malice
p30934
aVI\u2019m sure in me

aVWell well my lords respect him

aVWelcome Horatio Welcome good Marcellus
p31120
aVWhat has this thing appeared again tonight
p31121
aVI have seen nothing
p31122
aVHoratio says \u2019tis but our fantasy
p31123
aVAnd will not let belief take hold of him
p31124
aVTouching this dreaded sight twice seen of us
p31125
aVTherefore I have entreated him along
p31126
aVWith us to watch the minutes of this night
p31127
aVThat if again this apparition come
p31128
aVHe may approve our eyes and speak to it
p31129
aVTush tush \u2019twill not appear

aVSit down awhile

aVAnd let us once again assail your ears
p31132
aVThat are so fortified against our story
p31133
aVWhat we have two nights seen
p31134
aVWell sit we down
p31135
aVAnd let us hear Barnardo speak of this
p31136
aVLast night of all
p31137
aVWhen yond same star that\u2019s westward from the pole
p31138
aVHad made his course t\u2019 illume that part of heaven
p31139
aVWhere now it burns Marcellus and myself
p31140
aVThe bell then beating one
p31141
aVPeace break thee off Look where it comes again
p31142
aVIn the same figure like the King that\u2019s dead
p31143
aVThou art a scholar Speak to it Horatio
p31144
aVLooks he not like the King Mark it Horatio
p31145
aVMost like It harrows me with fear and wonder
p31146
aVIt would be spoke to
p31147
aVSpeak to it Horatio
p31148
aVWhat art thou that usurp\u2019st this time of night
p31149
aVTogether with that fair and warlike form
p31150
aVIn which the majesty of buried Denmark
p31151
aVDid sometimes march By heaven I charge thee speak
p31152
aVIt is offended
p31153
aVSee it stalks away
p31154
aVStay speak speak I charge thee speak
p31155
aV\u2019Tis gone and will not answer
p31156
aVHow now Horatio you tremble and look pale
p31157
aVIs not this something more than fantasy
p31158
aVWhat think you on \u2019t
p31159
aVBefore my God I might not this believe
p31160
aVWithout the sensible and true avouch
p31161
aVOf mine own eyes
p31162
aVIs it not like the King
p31163
aVAs thou art to thyself
p31164
aVSuch was the very armor he had on
p31165
aVWhen he the ambitious Norway combated
p31166
aVSo frowned he once when in an angry parle
p31167
aVHe smote the sledded Polacks on the ice
p31168
aV\u2019Tis strange
p31169
aVThus twice before and jump at this dead hour
p31170
aVWith martial stalk hath he gone by our watch
p31171
aVIn what particular thought to work I know not
p31172
aVBut in the gross and scope of mine opinion
p31173
aVThis bodes some strange eruption to our state
p31174
aVGood now sit down and tell me he that knows
p31175
aVWhy this same strict and most observant watch
p31176
aVSo nightly toils the subject of the land
p31177
aVAnd why such daily cast of brazen cannon
p31178
aVAnd foreign mart for implements of war
p31179
aVWhy such impress of shipwrights whose sore task
p31180
aVDoes not divide the Sunday from the week
p31181
aVWhat might be toward that this sweaty haste
p31182
aVDoth make the night joint laborer with the day
p31183
aVWho is \u2019t that can inform me
p31184
aVThat can I
p31185
aVAt least the whisper goes so our last king
p31186
aVWhose image even but now appeared to us
p31187
aVWas as you know by Fortinbras of Norway
p31188
aVThereto pricked on by a most emulate pride
p31189
aVDared to the combat in which our valiant Hamlet
p31190
aVFor so this side of our known world esteemed him
p31191
aVDid slay this Fortinbras who by a sealed compact
p31192
aVWell ratified by law and heraldry
p31193
aVDid forfeit with his life all those his lands
p31194
aVWhich he stood seized of to the conqueror
p31195
aVAgainst the which a moiety competent
p31196
aVWas gagèd by our king which had returned
p31197
aVTo the inheritance of Fortinbras
p31198
aVHad he been vanquisher as by the same comart
p31199
aVAnd carriage of the article designed
p31200
aVHis fell to Hamlet Now sir young Fortinbras
p31201
aVOf unimprovèd mettle hot and full
p31202
aVHath in the skirts of Norway here and there
p31203
aVSharked up a list of lawless resolutes
p31204
aVFor food and diet to some enterprise
p31205
aVThat hath a stomach in \u2019t which is no other
p31206
aVAs it doth well appear unto our state
p31207
aVBut to recover of us by strong hand
p31208
aVAnd terms compulsatory those foresaid lands
p31209
aVSo by his father lost And this I take it
p31210
aVIs the main motive of our preparations
p31211
aVThe source of this our watch and the chief head
p31212
aVOf this posthaste and rummage in the land
p31213
aVI think it be no other but e\u2019en so
p31214
aVWell may it sort that this portentous figure
p31215
aVComes armèd through our watch so like the king
p31216
aVThat was and is the question of these wars
p31217
aVA mote it is to trouble the mind\u2019s eye
p31218
aVIn the most high and palmy state of Rome
p31219
aVA little ere the mightiest Julius fell
p31220
aVThe graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead
p31221
aVDid squeak and gibber in the Roman streets
p31222
aVAs stars with trains of fire and dews of blood
p31223
aVDisasters in the sun and the moist star
p31224
aVUpon whose influence Neptune\u2019s empire stands
p31225
aVWas sick almost to doomsday with eclipse
p31226
aVAnd even the like precurse of feared events
p31227
aVAs harbingers preceding still the fates
p31228
aVAnd prologue to the omen coming on
p31229
aVHave heaven and Earth together demonstrated
p31230
aVUnto our climatures and countrymen
p31231
aVBut soft behold Lo where it comes again
p31232
aVI\u2019ll cross it though it blast me Stay illusion
p31233
aVIf thou hast any sound or use of voice
p31234
aVSpeak to me
p31235
aVIf there be any good thing to be done
p31236
aVThat may to thee do ease and grace to me
p31237
aVSpeak to me
p31238
aVIf thou art privy to thy country\u2019s fate
p31239
aVWhich happily foreknowing may avoid
p31240
aVO speak
p31241
aVOr if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
p31242
aVExtorted treasure in the womb of earth
p31243
aVFor which they say you spirits oft walk in death
p31244
aVSpeak of it
p31245
aVStay and speak Stop it Marcellus
p31246
aVShall I strike it with my partisan
p31247
aVDo if it will not stand
p31248
aV\u2019Tis here
p31249
aV\u2019Tis here
p31250
aV\u2019Tis gone
p31251
aVWe do it wrong being so majestical
p31252
aVTo offer it the show of violence
p31253
aVFor it is as the air invulnerable
p31254
aVAnd our vain blows malicious mockery
p31255
aVIt was about to speak when the cock crew
p31256
aVAnd then it started like a guilty thing
p31257
aVUpon a fearful summons I have heard
p31258
aVThe cock that is the trumpet to the morn
p31259
aVDoth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
p31260
aVAwake the god of day and at his warning
p31261
aVWhether in sea or fire in earth or air
p31262
aVTh\u2019 extravagant and erring spirit hies
p31263
aVTo his confine and of the truth herein
p31264
aVThis present object made probation
p31265
aVIt faded on the crowing of the cock
p31266
aVSome say that ever \u2019gainst that season comes
p31267
aVWherein our Savior\u2019s birth is celebrated
p31268
aVThis bird of dawning singeth all night long
p31269
aVAnd then they say no spirit dare stir abroad
p31270
aVThe nights are wholesome then no planets strike
p31271
aVNo fairy takes nor witch hath power to charm
p31272
aVSo hallowed and so gracious is that time
p31273
aVSo have I heard and do in part believe it
p31274
aVBut look the morn in russet mantle clad
p31275
aVWalks o\u2019er the dew of yon high eastward hill
p31276
aVBreak we our watch up and by my advice
p31277
aVLet us impart what we have seen tonight
p31278
aVUnto young Hamlet for upon my life
p31279
aVThis spirit dumb to us will speak to him
p31280
aVDo you consent we shall acquaint him with it
p31281
aVAs needful in our loves fitting our duty
p31282
aVLet\u2019s do \u2019t I pray and I this morning know
p31283
aVWhere we shall find him most convenient
p31284
aVThough yet of Hamlet our dear brother\u2019s death
p31285
aVThe memory be green and that it us befitted
p31286
aVTo bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom
p31287
aVTo be contracted in one brow of woe
p31288
aVYet so far hath discretion fought with nature
p31289
aVThat we with wisest sorrow think on him
p31290
aVTogether with remembrance of ourselves
p31291
aVTherefore our sometime sister now our queen
p31292
aVTh\u2019 imperial jointress to this warlike state
p31293
aVHave we as \u2019twere with a defeated joy
p31294
aVWith an auspicious and a dropping eye
p31295
aVWith mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage
p31296
aVIn equal scale weighing delight and dole
p31297
aVTaken to wife Nor have we herein barred
p31298
aVYour better wisdoms which have freely gone
p31299
aVWith this affair along For all our thanks
p31300
aVNow follows that you know Young Fortinbras
p31301
aVHolding a weak supposal of our worth
p31302
aVOr thinking by our late dear brother\u2019s death
p31303
aVOur state to be disjoint and out of frame
p31304
aVColleaguèd with this dream of his advantage
p31305
aVHe hath not failed to pester us with message
p31306
aVImporting the surrender of those lands
p31307
aVLost by his father with all bonds of law
p31308
aVTo our most valiant brother so much for him
p31309
aVNow for ourself and for this time of meeting
p31310
aVThus much the business is we have here writ
p31311
aVTo Norway uncle of young Fortinbras
p31312
aVWho impotent and bedrid scarcely hears
p31313
aVOf this his nephew\u2019s purpose to suppress
p31314
aVHis further gait herein in that the levies
p31315
aVThe lists and full proportions are all made
p31316
aVOut of his subject and we here dispatch
p31317
aVYou good Cornelius and you Voltemand
p31318
aVFor bearers of this greeting to old Norway
p31319
aVGiving to you no further personal power
p31320
aVTo business with the King more than the scope
p31321
aVOf these dilated articles allow
p31322
aVFarewell and let your haste commend your duty
p31323
aVIn that and all things will we show our duty
p31324
aVWe doubt it nothing Heartily farewell
p31325
aVAnd now Laertes what\u2019s the news with you
p31326
aVYou told us of some suit What is \u2019t Laertes
p31327
aVYou cannot speak of reason to the Dane
p31328
aVAnd lose your voice What wouldst thou beg Laertes
p31329
aVThat shall not be my offer not thy asking
p31330
aVThe head is not more native to the heart
p31331
aVThe hand more instrumental to the mouth
p31332
aVThan is the throne of Denmark to thy father
p31333
aVWhat wouldst thou have Laertes
p31334
aVMy dread lord
p31335
aVYour leave and favor to return to France
p31336
aVFrom whence though willingly I came to Denmark
p31337
aVTo show my duty in your coronation
p31338
aVYet now I must confess that duty done
p31339
aVMy thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
p31340
aVAnd bow them to your gracious leave and pardon
p31341
aVHave you your father\u2019s leave What says Polonius
p31342
aVHath my lord wrung from me my slow leave
p31343
aVBy laborsome petition and at last
p31344
aVUpon his will I sealed my hard consent
p31345
aVI do beseech you give him leave to go
p31346
aVTake thy fair hour Laertes Time be thine
p31347
aVAnd thy best graces spend it at thy will
p31348
aVBut now my cousin Hamlet and my son
p31349
aVA little more than kin and less than kind
p31350
aVHow is it that the clouds still hang on you
p31351
aVNot so my lord I am too much in the sun
p31352
aVGood Hamlet cast thy nighted color off
p31353
aVAnd let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark
p31354
aVDo not forever with thy vailèd lids
p31355
aVSeek for thy noble father in the dust
p31356
aVThou know\u2019st \u2019tis common all that lives must die
p31357
aVPassing through nature to eternity
p31358
aVAy madam it is common
p31359
aVIf it be
p31360
aVWhy seems it so particular with thee
p31361
aVSeems madam Nay it is I know not seems
p31362
aV\u2019Tis not alone my inky cloak good mother
p31363
aVNor customary suits of solemn black
p31364
aVNor windy suspiration of forced breath
p31365
aVNo nor the fruitful river in the eye
p31366
aVNor the dejected havior of the visage
p31367
aVTogether with all forms moods shapes of grief
p31368
aVThat can denote me truly These indeed seem
p31369
aVFor they are actions that a man might play
p31370
aVBut I have that within which passes show
p31371
aVThese but the trappings and the suits of woe
p31372
aV\u2019Tis sweet and commendable in your nature Hamlet
p31373
aVTo give these mourning duties to your father
p31374
aVBut you must know your father lost a father
p31375
aVThat father lost lost his and the survivor bound
p31376
aVIn filial obligation for some term
p31377
aVTo do obsequious sorrow But to persever
p31378
aVIn obstinate condolement is a course
p31379
aVOf impious stubbornness \u2019Tis unmanly grief
p31380
aVIt shows a will most incorrect to heaven
p31381
aVA heart unfortified a mind impatient
p31382
aVAn understanding simple and unschooled
p31383
aVFor what we know must be and is as common
p31384
aVAs any the most vulgar thing to sense
p31385
aVWhy should we in our peevish opposition
p31386
aVTake it to heart Fie \u2019tis a fault to heaven
p31387
aVA fault against the dead a fault to nature
p31388
aVTo reason most absurd whose common theme
p31389
aVIs death of fathers and who still hath cried
p31390
aVFrom the first corse till he that died today
p31391
aVThis must be so We pray you throw to earth
p31392
aVThis unprevailing woe and think of us
p31393
aVAs of a father for let the world take note
p31394
aVYou are the most immediate to our throne
p31395
aVAnd with no less nobility of love
p31396
aVThan that which dearest father bears his son
p31397
aVDo I impart toward you For your intent
p31398
aVIn going back to school in Wittenberg
p31399
aVIt is most retrograde to our desire
p31400
aVAnd we beseech you bend you to remain
p31401
aVHere in the cheer and comfort of our eye
p31402
aVOur chiefest courtier cousin and our son
p31403
aVLet not thy mother lose her prayers Hamlet
p31404
aVI pray thee stay with us Go not to Wittenberg
p31405
aVI shall in all my best obey you madam
p31406
aVWhy \u2019tis a loving and a fair reply
p31407
aVBe as ourself in Denmark Madam come
p31408
aVThis gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet
p31409
aVSits smiling to my heart in grace whereof
p31410
aVNo jocund health that Denmark drinks today
p31411
aVBut the great cannon to the clouds shall tell
p31412
aVAnd the King\u2019s rouse the heaven shall bruit again
p31413
aVRespeaking earthly thunder Come away
p31414
aVO that this too too sullied flesh would melt
p31415
aVThaw and resolve itself into a dew
p31416
aVOr that the Everlasting had not fixed
p31417
aVHis canon \u2019gainst self-slaughter O God God
p31418
aVHow weary stale flat and unprofitable
p31419
aVSeem to me all the uses of this world
p31420
aVFie on \u2019t ah fie \u2019Tis an unweeded garden
p31421
aVThat grows to seed Things rank and gross in nature
p31422
aVPossess it merely That it should come to this
p31423
aVBut two months dead nay not so much not two
p31424
aVSo excellent a king that was to this
p31425
aVHyperion to a satyr so loving to my mother
p31426
aVThat he might not beteem the winds of heaven
p31427
aVVisit her face too roughly Heaven and Earth
p31428
aVMust I remember Why she would hang on him
p31429
aVAs if increase of appetite had grown
p31430
aVBy what it fed on And yet within a month
p31431
aVLet me not think on \u2019t frailty thy name is woman
p31432
aVA little month or ere those shoes were old
p31433
aVWith which she followed my poor father\u2019s body
p31434
aVLike Niobe all tears why she even she
p31435
aVO God a beast that wants discourse of reason
p31436
aVWould have mourned longer married with my uncle
p31437
aVMy father\u2019s brother but no more like my father
p31438
aVThan I to Hercules Within a month
p31439
aVEre yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
p31440
aVHad left the flushing in her gallèd eyes
p31441
aVShe married O most wicked speed to post
p31442
aVWith such dexterity to incestuous sheets
p31443
aVIt is not nor it cannot come to good
p31444
aVBut break my heart for I must hold my tongue
p31445
aVHail to your Lordship
p31446
aVI am glad to see you well
p31447
aVHoratio or I do forget myself
p31448
aVThe same my lord and your poor servant ever
p31449
aVSir my good friend I\u2019ll change that name with you
p31450
aVAnd what make you from Wittenberg Horatio
p31451
aVMarcellus
p31452
aVMy good lord
p31453
aVI am very glad to see you To Barnardo Good even sir
p31454
aVBut what in faith make you from Wittenberg
p31455
aVA truant disposition good my lord
p31456
aVI would not hear your enemy say so
p31457
aVNor shall you do my ear that violence
p31458
aVTo make it truster of your own report
p31459
aVAgainst yourself I know you are no truant
p31460
aVBut what is your affair in Elsinore
p31461
aVWe\u2019ll teach you to drink deep ere you depart
p31462
aVMy lord I came to see your father\u2019s funeral
p31463
aVI prithee do not mock me fellow student
p31464
aVI think it was to see my mother\u2019s wedding
p31465
aVIndeed my lord it followed hard upon
p31466
aVThrift thrift Horatio The funeral baked meats
p31467
aVDid coldly furnish forth the marriage tables
p31468
aVWould I had met my dearest foe in heaven
p31469
aVOr ever I had seen that day Horatio
p31470
aVMy father methinks I see my father
p31471
aVWhere my lord
p31472
aVIn my mind\u2019s eye Horatio
p31473
aVI saw him once He was a goodly king
p31474
aVHe was a man Take him for all in all
p31475
aVI shall not look upon his like again
p31476
aVMy lord I think I saw him yesternight
p31477
aVSaw who
p31478
aVMy lord the King your father
p31479
aVThe King my father
p31480
aVSeason your admiration for a while
p31481
aVWith an attent ear till I may deliver
p31482
aVUpon the witness of these gentlemen
p31483
aVThis marvel to you
p31484
aVFor God\u2019s love let me hear
p31485
aVTwo nights together had these gentlemen
p31486
aVMarcellus and Barnardo on their watch
p31487
aVIn the dead waste and middle of the night
p31488
aVBeen thus encountered a figure like your father
p31489
aVArmed at point exactly cap-à-pie
p31490
aVAppears before them and with solemn march
p31491
aVGoes slow and stately by them Thrice he walked
p31492
aVBy their oppressed and fear-surprisèd eyes
p31493
aVWithin his truncheon\u2019s length whilst they distilled
p31494
aVAlmost to jelly with the act of fear
p31495
aVStand dumb and speak not to him This to me
p31496
aVIn dreadful secrecy impart they did
p31497
aVAnd I with them the third night kept the watch
p31498
aVWhere as they had delivered both in time
p31499
aVForm of the thing each word made true and good
p31500
aVThe apparition comes I knew your father
p31501
aVThese hands are not more like
p31502
aVBut where was this
p31503
aVMy lord upon the platform where we watch
p31504
aVDid you not speak to it
p31505
aVMy lord I did
p31506
aVBut answer made it none Yet once methought
p31507
aVIt lifted up its head and did address
p31508
aVItself to motion like as it would speak
p31509
aVBut even then the morning cock crew loud
p31510
aVAnd at the sound it shrunk in haste away
p31511
aVAnd vanished from our sight
p31512
aV\u2019Tis very strange
p31513
aVAs I do live my honored lord \u2019tis true
p31514
aVAnd we did think it writ down in our duty
p31515
aVTo let you know of it
p31516
aVIndeed sirs but this troubles me
p31517
aVHold you the watch tonight
p31518
aVWe do my lord
p31519
aVArmed say you
p31520
aVArmed my lord
p31521
aVFrom top to toe
p31522
aVMy lord from head to foot
p31523
aVThen saw you not his face
p31524
aVO yes my lord he wore his beaver up
p31525
aVWhat looked he frowningly
p31526
aVA countenance more in sorrow than in anger
p31527
aVPale or red
p31528
aVNay very pale
p31529
aVAnd fixed his eyes upon you
p31530
aVMost constantly
p31531
aVI would I had been there
p31532
aVIt would have much amazed you
p31533
aVVery like Stayed it long
p31534
aVWhile one with moderate haste might tell a hundred
p31535
aVLonger longer
p31536
aVNot when I saw \u2019t
p31537
aVHis beard was grizzled no
p31538
aVIt was as I have seen it in his life
p31539
aVA sable silvered
p31540
aVI will watch tonight
p31541
aVPerchance \u2019twill walk again
p31542
aVI warrant it will
p31543
aVIf it assume my noble father\u2019s person
p31544
aVI\u2019ll speak to it though hell itself should gape
p31545
aVAnd bid me hold my peace I pray you all
p31546
aVIf you have hitherto concealed this sight
p31547
aVLet it be tenable in your silence still
p31548
aVAnd whatsomever else shall hap tonight
p31549
aVGive it an understanding but no tongue
p31550
aVI will requite your loves So fare you well
p31551
aVUpon the platform \u2019twixt eleven and twelve
p31552
aVI\u2019ll visit you
p31553
aVOur duty to your Honor
p31554
aVYour loves as mine to you Farewell
p31555
aVMy father\u2019s spirit in arms All is not well
p31556
aVI doubt some foul play Would the night were come
p31557
aVTill then sit still my soul Foul deeds will rise
p31558
aVThough all the earth o\u2019erwhelm them to men\u2019s eyes
p31559
aVMy necessaries are embarked Farewell
p31560
aVAnd sister as the winds give benefit
p31561
aVAnd convey is assistant do not sleep
p31562
aVBut let me hear from you
p31563
aVDo you doubt that
p31564
aVFor Hamlet and the trifling of his favor
p31565
aVHold it a fashion and a toy in blood
p31566
aVA violet in the youth of primy nature
p31567
aVForward not permanent sweet not lasting
p31568
aVThe perfume and suppliance of a minute
p31569
aVNo more
p31570
aVNo more but so
p31571
aVThink it no more
p31572
aVFor nature crescent does not grow alone
p31573
aVIn thews and bulk but as this temple waxes
p31574
aVThe inward service of the mind and soul
p31575
aVGrows wide withal Perhaps he loves you now
p31576
aVAnd now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
p31577
aVThe virtue of his will but you must fear
p31578
aVHis greatness weighed his will is not his own
p31579
aVFor he himself is subject to his birth
p31580
aVHe may not as unvalued persons do
p31581
aVCarve for himself for on his choice depends
p31582
aVThe safety and the health of this whole state
p31583
aVAnd therefore must his choice be circumscribed
p31584
aVUnto the voice and yielding of that body
p31585
aVWhereof he is the head Then if he says he loves you
p31586
aVIt fits your wisdom so far to believe it
p31587
aVAs he in his particular act and place
p31588
aVMay give his saying deed which is no further
p31589
aVThan the main voice of Denmark goes withal
p31590
aVThen weigh what loss your honor may sustain
p31591
aVIf with too credent ear you list his songs
p31592
aVOr lose your heart or your chaste treasure open
p31593
aVTo his unmastered importunity
p31594
aVFear it Ophelia fear it my dear sister
p31595
aVAnd keep you in the rear of your affection
p31596
aVOut of the shot and danger of desire
p31597
aVThe chariest maid is prodigal enough
p31598
aVIf she unmask her beauty to the moon
p31599
aVVirtue itself \u2019scapes not calumnious strokes
p31600
aVThe canker galls the infants of the spring
p31601
aVToo oft before their buttons be disclosed
p31602
aVAnd in the morn and liquid dew of youth
p31603
aVContagious blastments are most imminent
p31604
aVBe wary then best safety lies in fear
p31605
aVYouth to itself rebels though none else near
p31606
aVI shall the effect of this good lesson keep
p31607
aVAs watchman to my heart But good my brother
p31608
aVDo not as some ungracious pastors do
p31609
aVShow me the steep and thorny way to heaven
p31610
aVWhiles like a puffed and reckless libertine
p31611
aVHimself the primrose path of dalliance treads
p31612
aVAnd recks not his own rede
p31613
aVO fear me not
p31614
aVI stay too long But here my father comes
p31615
aVA double blessing is a double grace
p31616
aVOccasion smiles upon a second leave
p31617
aVYet here Laertes Aboard aboard for shame
p31618
aVThe wind sits in the shoulder of your sail
p31619
aVAnd you are stayed for There my blessing with thee
p31620
aVAnd these few precepts in thy memory
p31621
aVLook thou character Give thy thoughts no tongue
p31622
aVNor any unproportioned thought his act
p31623
aVBe thou familiar but by no means vulgar
p31624
aVThose friends thou hast and their adoption tried
p31625
aVGrapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel
p31626
aVBut do not dull thy palm with entertainment
p31627
aVOf each new-hatched unfledged courage Beware
p31628
aVOf entrance to a quarrel but being in
p31629
aVBear \u2019t that th\u2019 opposèd may beware of thee
p31630
aVGive every man thy ear but few thy voice
p31631
aVTake each man\u2019s censure but reserve thy judgment
p31632
aVCostly thy habit as thy purse can buy
p31633
aVBut not expressed in fancy rich not gaudy
p31634
aVFor the apparel oft proclaims the man
p31635
aVAnd they in France of the best rank and station
p31636
aVAre of a most select and generous chief in that
p31637
aVNeither a borrower nor a lender be
p31638
aVFor loan oft loses both itself and friend
p31639
aVAnd borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry
p31640
aVThis above all to thine own self be true
p31641
aVAnd it must follow as the night the day
p31642
aVThou canst not then be false to any man
p31643
aVFarewell My blessing season this in thee
p31644
aVMost humbly do I take my leave my lord
p31645
aVThe time invests you Go your servants tend
p31646
aVFarewell Ophelia and remember well
p31647
aVWhat I have said to you
p31648
aV\u2019Tis in my memory locked
p31649
aVAnd you yourself shall keep the key of it
p31650
aVFarewell
p31651
aVWhat is \u2019t Ophelia he hath said to you
p31652
aVSo please you something touching the Lord Hamlet
p31653
aVMarry well bethought
p31654
aV\u2019Tis told me he hath very oft of late
p31655
aVGiven private time to you and you yourself
p31656
aVHave of your audience been most free and bounteous
p31657
aVIf it be so as so \u2019tis put on me
p31658
aVAnd that in way of caution I must tell you
p31659
aVYou do not understand yourself so clearly
p31660
aVAs it behooves my daughter and your honor
p31661

aVOf his affection to me

aVUnsifted in such perilous circumstance

aVI do not know my lord what I should think
p31668
aVMarry I will teach you Think yourself a baby
p31669
aVThat you have ta\u2019en these tenders for true pay
p31670
aVWhich are not sterling Tender yourself more dearly
p31671
aVOr not to crack the wind of the poor phrase
p31672
aVRunning it thus you\u2019ll tender me a fool
p31673
aVMy lord he hath importuned me with love
p31674
aVIn honorable fashion
p31675
aVAy fashion you may call it Go to go to
p31676
aVAnd hath given countenance to his speech my lord
p31677
aVWith almost all the holy vows of heaven
p31678
aVAy springes to catch woodcocks I do know
p31679
aVWhen the blood burns how prodigal the soul
p31680
aVLends the tongue vows These blazes daughter

aVGiving more light than heat extinct in both
p31682
aVEven in their promise as it is a-making
p31683
aVYou must not take for fire From this time
p31684
aVBe something scanter of your maiden presence
p31685
aVSet your entreatments at a higher rate
p31686
aVThan a command to parle For Lord Hamlet
p31687
aVBelieve so much in him that he is young
p31688
aVAnd with a larger tether may he walk
p31689
aVThan may be given you In few Ophelia
p31690
aVDo not believe his vows for they are brokers
p31691
aVNot of that dye which their investments show
p31692
aVBut mere implorators of unholy suits
p31693
aVBreathing like sanctified and pious bawds
p31694
aVThe better to beguile This is for all
p31695
aVI would not in plain terms from this time forth
p31696
aVHave you so slander any moment leisure

p31704
aVNo it is struck
p31705
aVIndeed I heard it not It then draws near the season
p31706
aVWherein the spirit held his wont to walk
p31707
aVWhat does this mean my lord
p31708
aVThe King doth wake tonight and takes his rouse
p31709
aVKeeps wassail and the swagg\u2019ring upspring reels
p31710
aVAnd as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down
p31711
aVThe kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out
p31712
aVThe triumph of his pledge
p31713
aVIs it a custom
p31714
aVAy marry is \u2019t
p31715
aVBut to my mind though I am native here
p31716
aVAnd to the manner born it is a custom
p31717
aVMore honored in the breach than the observance
p31718
aVThis heavy-headed revel east and west
p31719
aVMakes us traduced and taxed of other nations
p31720
aVThey clepe us drunkards and with swinish phrase
p31721
aVSoil our addition And indeed it takes
p31722
aVFrom our achievements though performed at height
p31723
aVThe pith and marrow of our attribute
p31724
aVSo oft it chances in particular men
p31725
aVThat for some vicious mole of nature in them
p31726
aVAs in their birth wherein they are not guilty
p31727
aVSince nature cannot choose his origin
p31728
aVBy the o\u2019ergrowth of some complexion
p31729
aVOft breaking down the pales and forts of reason
p31730
aVOr by some habit that too much o\u2019erleavens
p31731
aVThe form of plausive manners that these men
p31732
aVCarrying I say the stamp of one defect
p31733
aVBeing nature\u2019s livery or fortune\u2019s star
p31734
aVHis virtues else be they as pure as grace
p31735
aVAs infinite as man may undergo

aVGood my lord
p32068
aVObserve his inclination in yourself
p32069
aVI shall my lord
p32070
aVAnd let him ply his music
p32071
aVWell my lord
p32072
aVFarewell
p32073
aVHow now Ophelia what\u2019s the matter
p32074
aVO my lord my lord I have been so affrighted
p32075
aVWith what i\u2019 th\u2019 name of God
p32076
aVMy lord as I was sewing in my closet
p32077
aVLord Hamlet with his doublet all unbraced
p32078
aVNo hat upon his head his stockings fouled
p32079
aVUngartered and down-gyvèd to his ankle
p32080
aVPale as his shirt his knees knocking each other
p32081
aVAnd with a look so piteous in purport
p32082
aVAs if he had been loosèd out of hell
p32083
aVTo speak of horrors he comes before me
p32084
aVMad for thy love
p32085
aVMy lord I do not know
p32086
aVBut truly I do fear it
p32087
aVWhat said he
p32088
aVHe took me by the wrist and held me hard
p32089
aVThen goes he to the length of all his arm
p32090
aVAnd with his other hand thus o\u2019er his brow
p32091
aVHe falls to such perusal of my face
p32092
aVAs he would draw it Long stayed he so
p32093
aVAt last a little shaking of mine arm
p32094
aVAnd thrice his head thus waving up and down
p32095
aVHe raised a sigh so piteous and profound
p32096
aVAs it did seem to shatter all his bulk
p32097
aVAnd end his being That done he lets me go
p32098
aVAnd with his head over his shoulder turned
p32099
aVHe seemed to find his way without his eyes
p32100
aVFor out o\u2019 doors he went without their helps
p32101
aVAnd to the last bended their light on me
p32102
aVCome go with me I will go seek the King
p32103
aVThis is the very ecstasy of love
p32104
aVWhose violent property fordoes itself
p32105
aVAnd leads the will to desperate undertakings
p32106
aVAs oft as any passions under heaven
p32107
aVThat does afflict our natures I am sorry
p32108
aVWhat have you given him any hard words of late
p32109
aVNo my good lord but as you did command
p32110
aVI did repel his letters and denied
p32111
aVHis access to me
p32112
aVThat hath made him mad
p32113
aVI am sorry that with better heed and judgment
p32114
aVI had not coted him I feared he did but trifle
p32115
aVAnd meant to wrack thee But beshrew my jealousy
p32116
aVBy heaven it is as proper to our age
p32117
aVTo cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
p32118
aVAs it is common for the younger sort
p32119
aVTo lack discretion Come go we to the King
p32120
aVThis must be known which being kept close might move
p32121
aVMore grief to hide than hate to utter love
p32122
aVCome
p32123
aVWelcome dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
p32124
aVMoreover that we much did long to see you
p32125
aVThe need we have to use you did provoke

aVOf Hamlet\u2019s transformation so call it
p32128
aVSith nor th\u2019 exterior nor the inward man
p32129
aVResembles that it was What it should be
p32130
aVMore than his father\u2019s death that thus hath put him
p32131
aVSo much from th\u2019 understanding of himself
p32132
aVI cannot dream of I entreat you both

p32137
aVTo draw him on to pleasures and to gather
p32138

p32170
aVBoth to my God and to my gracious king
p32171
aVAnd I do think or else this brain of mine
p32172
aVHunts not the trail of policy so sure
p32173
aVAs it hath used to do that I have found
p32174
aVThe very cause of Hamlet\u2019s lunacy
p32175
aVO speak of that That do I long to hear

aVGive first admittance to th\u2019 ambassadors
p32177

aVThyself do grace to them and bring them in
p32179
aVHe tells me my dear Gertrude he hath found
p32180
aVThe head and source of all your son\u2019s distemper
p32181
aVI doubt it is no other but the main
p32182
aVHis father\u2019s death and our o\u2019erhasty marriage
p32183
aVWell we shall sift him
p32184
aVWelcome my good friends
p32185
aVSay Voltemand what from our brother Norway
p32186
aVMost fair return of greetings and desires
p32187
aVUpon our first he sent out to suppress
p32188
aVHis nephew\u2019s levies which to him appeared
p32189
aVTo be a preparation \u2019gainst the Polack
p32190
aVBut better looked into he truly found
p32191
aVIt was against your Highness Whereat grieved
p32192
aVThat so his sickness age and impotence
p32193
aVWas falsely borne in hand sends out arrests
p32194
aVOn Fortinbras which he in brief obeys
p32195
aVReceives rebuke from Norway and in fine
p32196
aVMakes vow before his uncle never more
p32197
aVTo give th\u2019 assay of arms against your Majesty
p32198
aVWhereon old Norway overcome with joy
p32199
aVGives him three-score thousand crowns in annual fee
p32200
aVAnd his commission to employ those soldiers
p32201
aVSo levied as before against the Polack
p32202
aVWith an entreaty herein further shown
p32203
aVThat it might please you to give quiet pass
p32204
aVThrough your dominions for this enterprise
p32205
aVOn such regards of safety and allowance
p32206
aVAs therein are set down
p32207
aVIt likes us well
p32208
aVAnd at our more considered time we\u2019ll read
p32209
aVAnswer and think upon this business

aVMeantime we thank you for your well-took labor
p32211
aVGo to your rest At night we\u2019ll feast together
p32212
aVMost welcome home
p32213
aVThis business is well ended
p32214
aVMy liege and madam to expostulate
p32215
aVWhat majesty should be what duty is
p32216
aVWhy day is day night night and time is time
p32217
aVWere nothing but to waste night day and time
p32218
aVTherefore since brevity is the soul of wit
p32219
aVAnd tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes
p32220
aVI will be brief Your noble son is mad
p32221
aVMad call I it for to define true madness
p32222
aVWhat is \u2019t but to be nothing else but mad
p32223
aVBut let that go
p32224
aVMore matter with less art
p32225
aVMadam I swear I use no art at all
p32226
aVThat he\u2019s mad \u2019tis true \u2019tis true \u2019tis pity
p32227
aVAnd pity \u2019tis \u2019tis true a foolish figure
p32228
aVBut farewell it for I will use no art
p32229
aVMad let us grant him then and now remains
p32230
aVThat we find out the cause of this effect
p32231
aVOr rather say the cause of this defect
p32232
aVFor this effect defective comes by cause
p32233
aVThus it remains and the remainder thus
p32234
aVPerpend
p32235
aVI have a daughter have while she is mine
p32236
aVWho in her duty and obedience mark
p32237
aVHath given me this Now gather and surmise
p32238
aVCame this from Hamlet to her
p32239
aVGood madam stay awhile I will be faithful
p32240
aVDoubt thou the stars are fire
p32241
aVDoubt that the sun doth move
p32242
aVDoubt truth to be a liar
p32243
aVBut never doubt I love
p32244
aVThis in obedience hath my daughter shown me
p32245
aVAnd more above hath his solicitings
p32246
aVAs they fell out by time by means and place
p32247
aVAll given to mine ear
p32248
aVBut how hath she received his love
p32249
aVWhat do you think of me
p32250
aVAs of a man faithful and honorable
p32251
aVI would fain prove so But what might you think
p32252
aVWhen I had seen this hot love on the wing
p32253
aVAs I perceived it I must tell you that
p32254
aVBefore my daughter told me what might you
p32255
aVOr my dear Majesty your queen here think
p32256
aVIf I had played the desk or table-book
p32257
aVOr given my heart a winking mute and dumb
p32258
aVOr looked upon this love with idle sight
p32259
aVWhat might you think No I went round to work
p32260
aVAnd my young mistress thus I did bespeak
p32261
aVLord Hamlet is a prince out of thy star
p32262
aVThis must not be And then I prescripts gave her
p32263
aVThat she should lock herself from his resort
p32264
aVAdmit no messengers receive no tokens
p32265
aVWhich done she took the fruits of my advice
p32266
aVAnd he repelled a short tale to make
p32267
aVFell into a sadness then into a fast
p32268
aVThence to a watch thence into a weakness
p32269
aVThence to a lightness and by this declension
p32270
aVInto the madness wherein now he raves
p32271
aVAnd all we mourn for
p32272
aVDo you think \u2019tis this
p32273
aVIt may be very like
p32274
aVHath there been such a time I would fain know that
p32275
aVThat I have positively said \u2019Tis so
p32276
aVWhen it proved otherwise
p32277
aVNot that I know
p32278
aVTake this from this if this be otherwise
p32279
aVIf circumstances lead me I will find
p32280
aVWhere truth is hid though it were hid indeed
p32281
aVWithin the center
p32282
aVHow may we try it further
p32283
aVYou know sometimes he walks four hours together
p32284
aVHere in the lobby
p32285
aVSo he does indeed
p32286
aVAt such a time I\u2019ll loose my daughter to him
p32287
aVTo the King Be you and I behind an arras then
p32288
aVMark the encounter If he love her not
p32289
aVAnd be not from his reason fall\u2019n thereon
p32290
aVLet me be no assistant for a state
p32291
aVBut keep a farm and carters
p32292
aVWe will try it
p32293
aVBut look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading
p32294
aVAway I do beseech you both away
p32295
aVI\u2019ll board him presently O give me leave
p32296
aVHow does my good Lord Hamlet
p32297
aVAs the indifferent children of the earth
p32298
aVHappy in that we are not overhappy
p32299
aVOn Fortune\u2019s cap we are not the very button
p32300
aVOne fair daughter and no more
p32301
aVThe which he lovèd passing well
p32302
aVAs by lot God wot
p32303
aVIt came to pass as most like it was
p32304
aVThe rugged Pyrrhus like th\u2019 Hyrcanian beast
p32305
aVThe rugged Pyrrhus he whose sable arms
p32306
aVBlack as his purpose did the night resemble
p32307
aVWhen he lay couchèd in th\u2019 ominous horse
p32308
aVHath now this dread and black complexion smeared
p32309
aVWith heraldry more dismal Head to foot
p32310
aVNow is he total gules horridly tricked
p32311
aVWith blood of fathers mothers daughters sons
p32312
aVBaked and impasted with the parching streets
p32313
aVThat lend a tyrannous and a damnèd light
p32314
aVTo their lord\u2019s murder Roasted in wrath and fire
p32315
aVAnd thus o\u2019ersizèd with coagulate gore
p32316
aVWith eyes like carbuncles the hellish Pyrrhus
p32317
aVOld grandsire Priam seeks
p32318
aVAnon he finds him
p32319
aVStriking too short at Greeks His antique sword
p32320
aVRebellious to his arm lies where it falls
p32321
aVRepugnant to command Unequal matched
p32322
aVPyrrhus at Priam drives in rage strikes wide
p32323
aVBut with the whiff and wind of his fell sword
p32324
aVTh\u2019 unnervèd father falls Then senseless Ilium
p32325
aVSeeming to feel this blow with flaming top
p32326
aVStoops to his base and with a hideous crash
p32327
aVTakes prisoner Pyrrhus\u2019 ear For lo his sword
p32328
aVWhich was declining on the milky head
p32329
aVOf reverend Priam seemed i\u2019 th\u2019 air to stick
p32330
aVSo as a painted tyrant Pyrrhus stood
p32331
aVAnd like a neutral to his will and matter
p32332
aVDid nothing
p32333
aVBut as we often see against some storm
p32334
aVA silence in the heavens the rack stand still
p32335
aVThe bold winds speechless and the orb below
p32336
aVAs hush as death anon the dreadful thunder
p32337
aVDoth rend the region so after Pyrrhus\u2019 pause
p32338
aVArousèd vengeance sets him new a-work
p32339
aVAnd never did the Cyclops\u2019 hammers fall
p32340
aVOn Mars\u2019s armor forged for proof eterne
p32341
aVWith less remorse than Pyrrhus\u2019 bleeding sword
p32342
aVNow falls on Priam
p32343
aVOut out thou strumpet Fortune All you gods
p32344
aVIn general synod take away her power
p32345
aVBreak all the spokes and fellies from her wheel
p32346
aVAnd bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven
p32347
aVAs low as to the fiends
p32348
aVBut who ah woe had seen the moblèd queen
p32349
aVRun barefoot up and down threat\u2019ning the flames
p32350
aVWith bisson rheum a clout upon that head
p32351
aVWhere late the diadem stood and for a robe
p32352
aVAbout her lank and all o\u2019erteemèd loins
p32353
aVA blanket in the alarm of fear caught up
p32354
aVWho this had seen with tongue in venom steeped
p32355
aV\u2019Gainst Fortune\u2019s state would treason have pronounced
p32356
aVBut if the gods themselves did see her then
p32357
aVWhen she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport
p32358
aVIn mincing with his sword her husband\u2019s limbs
p32359
aVThe instant burst of clamor that she made
p32360
aVUnless things mortal move them not at all
p32361
aVWould have made milch the burning eyes of heaven
p32362
aVAnd passion in the gods
p32363
aVAy so good-bye to you
p32364
aVNow I am alone
p32365
aVO what a rogue and peasant slave am I
p32366
aVIs it not monstrous that this player here
p32367
aVBut in a fiction in a dream of passion
p32368
aVCould force his soul so to his own conceit
p32369
aVThat from her working all his visage wanned
p32370
aVTears in his eyes distraction in his aspect
p32371
aVA broken voice and his whole function suiting
p32372
aVWith forms to his conceit and all for nothing
p32373
aVFor Hecuba
p32374
aVWhat\u2019s Hecuba to him or he to Hecuba
p32375
aVThat he should weep for her What would he do
p32376
aVHad he the motive and the cue for passion
p32377
aVThat I have He would drown the stage with tears
p32378
aVAnd cleave the general ear with horrid speech
p32379
aVMake mad the guilty and appall the free
p32380
aVConfound the ignorant and amaze indeed
p32381
aVThe very faculties of eyes and ears Yet I
p32382
aVA dull and muddy-mettled rascal peak
p32383
aVLike John-a-dreams unpregnant of my cause
p32384
aVAnd can say nothing no not for a king
p32385
aVUpon whose property and most dear life
p32386
aVA damned defeat was made Am I a coward
p32387
aVWho calls me villain breaks my pate across
p32388
aVPlucks off my beard and blows it in my face
p32389
aVTweaks me by the nose gives me the lie i\u2019 th\u2019 throat
p32390
aVAs deep as to the lungs Who does me this
p32391
aVHa \u2019Swounds I should take it For it cannot be
p32392
aVBut I am pigeon-livered and lack gall
p32393
aVTo make oppression bitter or ere this
p32394
aVI should have fatted all the region kites
p32395
aVWith this slave\u2019s offal Bloody bawdy villain
p32396
aVRemorseless treacherous lecherous kindless villain
p32397
aVO vengeance
p32398
aVWhy what an ass am I This is most brave
p32399
aVThat I the son of a dear father murdered
p32400
aVPrompted to my revenge by heaven and hell
p32401
aVMust like a whore unpack my heart with words
p32402
aVAnd fall a-cursing like a very drab
p32403
aVA stallion Fie upon \u2019t Foh
p32404
aVAbout my brains Hum I have heard
p32405
aVThat guilty creatures sitting at a play
p32406
aVHave by the very cunning of the scene
p32407
aVBeen struck so to the soul that presently
p32408
aVThey have proclaimed their malefactions
p32409
aVFor murder though it have no tongue will speak
p32410
aVWith most miraculous organ I\u2019ll have these players
p32411
aVPlay something like the murder of my father
p32412
aVBefore mine uncle I\u2019ll observe his looks
p32413
aVI\u2019ll tent him to the quick If he do blench
p32414
aVI know my course The spirit that I have seen
p32415
aVMay be a devil and the devil hath power
p32416
aVT\u2019 assume a pleasing shape yea and perhaps
p32417
aVOut of my weakness and my melancholy
p32418
aVAs he is very potent with such spirits
p32419
aVAbuses me to damn me I\u2019ll have grounds
p32420
aVMore relative than this The play\u2019s the thing
p32421
aVWherein I\u2019ll catch the conscience of the King
p32422
aVAnd can you by no drift of conference
p32423
aVGet from him why he puts on this confusion
p32424
aVGrating so harshly all his days of quiet
p32425
aVWith turbulent and dangerous lunacy
p32426
aVHe does confess he feels himself distracted
p32427
aVBut from what cause he will by no means speak
p32428
aVNor do we find him forward to be sounded
p32429
aVBut with a crafty madness keeps aloof
p32430
aVWhen we would bring him on to some confession
p32431
aVOf his true state
p32432
aVDid he receive you well
p32433
aVMost like a gentleman
p32434
aVBut with much forcing of his disposition
p32435
aVNiggard of question but of our demands
p32436
aVMost free in his reply
p32437
aVDid you assay him to any pastime
p32438
aVMadam it so fell out that certain players
p32439
aVWe o\u2019erraught on the way Of these we told him
p32440
aVAnd there did seem in him a kind of joy
p32441
aVTo hear of it They are here about the court
p32442
aVAnd as I think they have already order
p32443
aVThis night to play before him
p32444
aV\u2019Tis most true
p32445
aVAnd he beseeched me to entreat your Majesties
p32446
aVTo hear and see the matter
p32447
aVWith all my heart and it doth much content me
p32448
aVTo hear him so inclined
p32449
aVGood gentlemen give him a further edge
p32450
aVAnd drive his purpose into these delights
p32451
aVWe shall my lord
p32452
aVSweet Gertrude leave us too
p32453
aVFor we have closely sent for Hamlet hither
p32454
aVThat he as \u2019twere by accident may here

aVAffront Ophelia
p32456
aVHer father and myself lawful espials
p32457
aVWill so bestow ourselves that seeing unseen
p32458
aVWe may of their encounter frankly judge
p32459
aVAnd gather by him as he is behaved
p32460
aVIf \u2019t be th\u2019 affliction of his love or no
p32461
aVThat thus he suffers for
p32462
aVI shall obey you
p32463
aVAnd for your part Ophelia I do wish
p32464
aVThat your good beauties be the happy cause
p32465
aVOf Hamlet\u2019s wildness So shall I hope your virtues
p32466
aVWill bring him to his wonted way again
p32467
aVTo both your honors
p32468
aVMadam I wish it may
p32469
aVOphelia walk you here Gracious so please you
p32470
aVWe will bestow ourselves To Ophelia Read on this book
p32471
aVThat show of such an exercise may color
p32472
aVYour loneliness We are oft to blame in this
p32473
aV\u2019Tis too much proved that with devotion\u2019s visage
p32474
aVAnd pious action we do sugar o\u2019er
p32475
aVThe devil himself
p32476
aVO \u2019tis too true
p32477
aVHow smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience
p32478
aVThe harlot\u2019s cheek beautied with plast\u2019ring art
p32479
aVIs not more ugly to the thing that helps it
p32480
aVThan is my deed to my most painted word
p32481
aVO heavy burden
p32482
aVI hear him coming Let\u2019s withdraw my lord
p32483
aVTo be or not to be that is the question
p32484
aVWhether \u2019tis nobler in the mind to suffer
p32485
aVThe slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
p32486
aVOr to take arms against a sea of troubles
p32487
aVAnd by opposing end them To die to sleep
p32488
aVNo more and by a sleep to say we end
p32489
aVThe heartache and the thousand natural shocks
p32490
aVThat flesh is heir to \u2019tis a consummation
p32491
aVDevoutly to be wished To die to sleep
p32492
aVTo sleep perchance to dream Ay there\u2019s the rub
p32493
aVFor in that sleep of death what dreams may come
p32494
aVWhen we have shuffled off this mortal coil
p32495
aVMust give us pause There\u2019s the respect
p32496
aVThat makes calamity of so long life
p32497
aVFor who would bear the whips and scorns of time
p32498
aVTh\u2019 oppressor\u2019s wrong the proud man\u2019s contumely
p32499
aVThe pangs of despised love the law\u2019s delay
p32500
aVThe insolence of office and the spurns
p32501
aVThat patient merit of th\u2019 unworthy takes
p32502
aVWhen he himself might his quietus make
p32503
aVWith a bare bodkin Who would fardels bear
p32504
aVTo grunt and sweat under a weary life
p32505
aVBut that the dread of something after death
p32506
aVThe undiscovered country from whose bourn
p32507
aVNo traveler returns puzzles the will
p32508
aVAnd makes us rather bear those ills we have
p32509
aVThan fly to others that we know not of
p32510
aVThus conscience does make cowards of us all
p32511
aVAnd thus the native hue of resolution
p32512
aVIs sicklied o\u2019er with the pale cast of thought
p32513
aVAnd enterprises of great pitch and moment
p32514
aVWith this regard their currents turn awry
p32515
aVAnd lose the name of action Soft you now
p32516
aVThe fair Ophelia Nymph in thy orisons
p32517
aVBe all my sins remembered
p32518
aVGood my lord
p32519
aVHow does your Honor for this many a day
p32520
aVI humbly thank you well
p32521
aVMy lord I have remembrances of yours
p32522
aVThat I have longèd long to redeliver
p32523
aVI pray you now receive them
p32524
aVNo not I I never gave you aught
p32525
aVMy honored lord you know right well you did
p32526
aVAnd with them words of so sweet breath composed
p32527
aVAs made the things more rich Their perfume lost
p32528
aVTake these again for to the noble mind
p32529
aVRich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind
p32530
aVThere my lord
p32531
aVO what a noble mind is here o\u2019erthrown
p32532
aVThe courtier\u2019s soldier\u2019s scholar\u2019s eye tongue sword
p32533
aVTh\u2019 expectancy and rose of the fair state
p32534
aVThe glass of fashion and the mold of form
p32535
aVTh\u2019 observed of all observers quite quite down
p32536
aVAnd I of ladies most deject and wretched
p32537
aVThat sucked the honey of his musicked vows
p32538
aVNow see that noble and most sovereign reason
p32539
aVLike sweet bells jangled out of time and harsh
p32540
aVThat unmatched form and stature of blown youth
p32541
aVBlasted with ecstasy O woe is me
p32542
aVT\u2019 have seen what I have seen see what I see
p32543
aVLove His affections do not that way tend
p32544
aVNor what he spake though it lacked form a little
p32545
aVWas not like madness There\u2019s something in his soul
p32546
aVO\u2019er which his melancholy sits on brood
p32547
aVAnd I do doubt the hatch and the disclose
p32548
aVWill be some danger which for to prevent
p32549
aVI have in quick determination
p32550
aVThus set it down he shall with speed to England
p32551
aVFor the demand of our neglected tribute
p32552
aVHaply the seas and countries different
p32553
aVWith variable objects shall expel
p32554
aVThis something-settled matter in his heart
p32555
aVWhereon his brains still beating puts him thus
p32556
aVFrom fashion of himself What think you on \u2019t
p32557
aVIt shall do well But yet do I believe
p32558
aVThe origin and commencement of his grief
p32559
aVSprung from neglected love How now Ophelia
p32560
aVYou need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said
p32561
aVWe heard it all My lord do as you please
p32562
aVBut if you hold it fit after the play
p32563
aVLet his queen-mother all alone entreat him
p32564
aVTo show his grief Let her be round with him
p32565
aVAnd I\u2019ll be placed so please you in the ear
p32566
aVOf all their conference If she find him not
p32567
aVTo England send him or confine him where
p32568
aVYour wisdom best shall think
p32569
aVIt shall be so
p32570
aVMadness in great ones must not unwatched go
p32571
aVHoratio thou art e\u2019en as just a man
p32572
aVAs e\u2019er my conversation coped withal
p32573
aVO my dear lord
p32574
aVNay do not think I flatter
p32575
aVFor what advancement may I hope from thee
p32576
aVThat no revenue hast but thy good spirits
p32577
aVTo feed and clothe thee Why should the poor be flattered
p32578
aVNo let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp
p32579
aVAnd crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
p32580
aVWhere thrift may follow fawning Dost thou hear
p32581
aVSince my dear soul was mistress of her choice
p32582
aVAnd could of men distinguish her election
p32583
aVHath sealed thee for herself For thou hast been
p32584
aVAs one in suffering all that suffers nothing
p32585
aVA man that Fortune\u2019s buffets and rewards
p32586
aVHast ta\u2019en with equal thanks and blessed are those
p32587
aVWhose blood and judgment are so well commeddled
p32588
aVThat they are not a pipe for Fortune\u2019s finger
p32589
aVTo sound what stop she please Give me that man
p32590
aVThat is not passion\u2019s slave and I will wear him
p32591
aVIn my heart\u2019s core ay in my heart of heart
p32592
aVAs I do thee Something too much of this
p32593
aVThere is a play tonight before the King
p32594
aVOne scene of it comes near the circumstance
p32595
aVWhich I have told thee of my father\u2019s death
p32596
aVI prithee when thou seest that act afoot
p32597
aVEven with the very comment of thy soul
p32598
aVObserve my uncle If his occulted guilt
p32599
aVDo not itself unkennel in one speech
p32600
aVIt is a damnèd ghost that we have seen
p32601
aVAnd my imaginations are as foul
p32602
aVAs Vulcan\u2019s stithy Give him heedful note
p32603
aVFor I mine eyes will rivet to his face
p32604
aVAnd after we will both our judgments join
p32605
aVIn censure of his seeming
p32606
aVWell my lord
p32607
aVIf he steal aught the whilst this play is playing
p32608
aVAnd \u2019scape detecting I will pay the theft
p32609
aVFor us and for our tragedy
p32610
aVHere stooping to your clemency
p32611
aVWe beg your hearing patiently
p32612
aVFull thirty times hath Phoebus\u2019 cart gone round
p32613
aVNeptune\u2019s salt wash and Tellus\u2019 orbèd ground
p32614
aVAnd thirty dozen moons with borrowed sheen
p32615
aVAbout the world have times twelve thirties been
p32616
aVSince love our hearts and Hymen did our hands
p32617
aVUnite commutual in most sacred bands
p32618
aVSo many journeys may the sun and moon
p32619
aVMake us again count o\u2019er ere love be done
p32620
aVBut woe is me You are so sick of late
p32621
aVSo far from cheer and from your former state
p32622
aVThat I distrust you Yet though I distrust
p32623
aVDiscomfort you my lord it nothing must
p32624
aVFor women fear too much even as they love
p32625
aVAnd women\u2019s fear and love hold quantity
p32626
aVIn neither aught or in extremity
p32627
aVNow what my love is proof hath made you know
p32628
aVAnd as my love is sized my fear is so
p32629
aVWhere love is great the littlest doubts are fear
p32630
aVWhere little fears grow great great love grows there
p32631
aVFaith I must leave thee love and shortly too
p32632
aVMy operant powers their functions leave to do
p32633
aVAnd thou shall live in this fair world behind
p32634
aVHonored beloved and haply one as kind
p32635
aVFor husband shalt thou
p32636
aVO confound the rest
p32637
aVSuch love must needs be treason in my breast
p32638
aVIn second husband let me be accurst
p32639
aVNone wed the second but who killed the first
p32640
aVThe instances that second marriage move
p32641
aVAre base respects of thrift but none of love
p32642
aVA second time I kill my husband dead
p32643
aVWhen second husband kisses me in bed
p32644
aVI do believe you think what now you speak
p32645
aVBut what we do determine oft we break
p32646
aVPurpose is but the slave to memory
p32647
aVOf violent birth but poor validity
p32648
aVWhich now the fruit unripe sticks on the tree
p32649
aVBut fall unshaken when they mellow be
p32650
aVMost necessary \u2019tis that we forget
p32651
aVTo pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt
p32652
aVWhat to ourselves in passion we propose
p32653
aVThe passion ending doth the purpose lose
p32654
aVThe violence of either grief or joy
p32655
aVTheir own enactures with themselves destroy
p32656
aVWhere joy most revels grief doth most lament
p32657
aVGrief joys joy grieves on slender accident
p32658
aVThis world is not for aye nor \u2019tis not strange
p32659
aVThat even our loves should with our fortunes change
p32660
aVFor \u2019tis a question left us yet to prove
p32661
aVWhether love lead fortune or else fortune love
p32662
aVThe great man down you mark his favorite flies
p32663
aVThe poor advanced makes friends of enemies
p32664
aVAnd hitherto doth love on fortune tend
p32665
aVFor who not needs shall never lack a friend
p32666
aVAnd who in want a hollow friend doth try
p32667
aVDirectly seasons him his enemy
p32668
aVBut orderly to end where I begun
p32669
aVOur wills and fates do so contrary run
p32670
aVThat our devices still are overthrown
p32671
aVOur thoughts are ours their ends none of our own
p32672
aVSo think thou wilt no second husband wed
p32673
aVBut die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead
p32674
aVNor Earth to me give food nor heaven light
p32675
aVSport and repose lock from me day and night
p32676
aVTo desperation turn my trust and hope
p32677
aVAn anchor\u2019s cheer in prison be my scope
p32678
aVEach opposite that blanks the face of joy
p32679
aVMeet what I would have well and it destroy
p32680
aVBoth here and hence pursue me lasting strife
p32681
aVIf once a widow ever I be wife
p32682
aV\u2019Tis deeply sworn Sweet leave me here awhile
p32683
aVMy spirits grow dull and fain I would beguile
p32684
aVThe tedious day with sleep
p32685
aVSleep rock thy brain
p32686
aVAnd never come mischance between us twain
p32687
aVThoughts black hands apt drugs fit and time agreeing
p32688
aVConfederate season else no creature seeing
p32689
aVThou mixture rank of midnight weeds collected
p32690
aVWith Hecate\u2019s ban thrice blasted thrice infected
p32691
aVThy natural magic and dire property
p32692
aVOn wholesome life usurp immediately
p32693
aVWhy let the strucken deer go weep
p32694
aVThe hart ungallèd play
p32695
aVFor some must watch while some must sleep
p32696
aVThus runs the world away
p32697
aVFor thou dost know O Damon dear
p32698
aVThis realm dismantled was
p32699
aVOf Jove himself and now reigns here
p32700
aVA very very pajock
p32701
aVFor if the King like not the comedy
p32702
aVWhy then belike he likes it not perdy
p32703
aV\u2019Tis now the very witching time of night
p32704
aVWhen churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out
p32705
aVContagion to this world Now could I drink hot blood
p32706
aVAnd do such bitter business as the day
p32707
aVWould quake to look on Soft now to my mother
p32708
aVO heart lose not thy nature let not ever
p32709
aVThe soul of Nero enter this firm bosom
p32710
aVLet me be cruel not unnatural
p32711
aVI will speak daggers to her but use none
p32712
aVMy tongue and soul in this be hypocrites
p32713
aVHow in my words somever she be shent
p32714
aVTo give them seals never my soul consent
p32715
aVI like him not nor stands it safe with us
p32716
aVTo let his madness range Therefore prepare you
p32717
aVI your commission will forthwith dispatch
p32718
aVAnd he to England shall along with you
p32719
aVThe terms of our estate may not endure
p32720
aVHazard so near \u2019s as doth hourly grow
p32721
aVOut of his brows
p32722
aVWe will ourselves provide
p32723
aVMost holy and religious fear it is
p32724
aVTo keep those many many bodies safe
p32725
aVThat live and feed upon your Majesty
p32726
aVThe single and peculiar life is bound
p32727
aVWith all the strength and armor of the mind
p32728
aVTo keep itself from noyance but much more
p32729
aVThat spirit upon whose weal depends and rests
p32730
aVThe lives of many The cess of majesty
p32731
aVDies not alone but like a gulf doth draw
p32732
aVWhat\u2019s near it with it or it is a massy wheel
p32733
aVFixed on the summit of the highest mount
p32734
aVTo whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things
p32735
aVAre mortised and adjoined which when it falls
p32736
aVEach small annexment petty consequence
p32737
aVAttends the boist\u2019rous ruin Never alone
p32738
aVDid the king sigh but with a general groan
p32739
aVArm you I pray you to this speedy voyage
p32740
aVFor we will fetters put about this fear
p32741
aVWhich now goes too free-footed
p32742
aVWe will haste us
p32743
aVMy lord he\u2019s going to his mother\u2019s closet
p32744
aVBehind the arras I\u2019ll convey myself
p32745
aVTo hear the process I\u2019ll warrant she\u2019ll tax him home
p32746
aVAnd as you said and wisely was it said
p32747
aV\u2019Tis meet that some more audience than a mother
p32748
aVSince nature makes them partial should o\u2019erhear
p32749
aVThe speech of vantage Fare you well my liege
p32750
aVI\u2019ll call upon you ere you go to bed
p32751
aVAnd tell you what I know
p32752
aVThanks dear my lord
p32753
aVO my offense is rank it smells to heaven
p32754
aVIt hath the primal eldest curse upon \u2019t
p32755
aVA brother\u2019s murder Pray can I not
p32756
aVThough inclination be as sharp as will
p32757
aVMy stronger guilt defeats my strong intent
p32758
aVAnd like a man to double business bound
p32759
aVI stand in pause where I shall first begin
p32760
aVAnd both neglect What if this cursèd hand
p32761
aVWere thicker than itself with brother\u2019s blood
p32762
aVIs there not rain enough in the sweet heavens
p32763
aVTo wash it white as snow Whereto serves mercy
p32764
aVBut to confront the visage of offense
p32765
aVAnd what\u2019s in prayer but this twofold force
p32766
aVTo be forestallèd ere we come to fall
p32767
aVOr pardoned being down Then I\u2019ll look up
p32768
aVMy fault is past But O what form of prayer
p32769
aVCan serve my turn Forgive me my foul murder
p32770
aVThat cannot be since I am still possessed
p32771
aVOf those effects for which I did the murder
p32772
aVMy crown mine own ambition and my queen
p32773
aVMay one be pardoned and retain th\u2019 offense
p32774
aVIn the corrupted currents of this world
p32775
aVOffense\u2019s gilded hand may shove by justice
p32776
aVAnd oft \u2019tis seen the wicked prize itself
p32777
aVBuys out the law But \u2019tis not so above
p32778
aVThere is no shuffling there the action lies
p32779
aVIn his true nature and we ourselves compelled
p32780
aVEven to the teeth and forehead of our faults
p32781
aVTo give in evidence What then What rests
p32782
aVTry what repentance can What can it not
p32783
aVYet what can it when one cannot repent
p32784
aVO wretched state O bosom black as death
p32785
aVO limèd soul that struggling to be free
p32786
aVArt more engaged Help angels Make assay
p32787
aVBow stubborn knees and heart with strings of steel
p32788
aVBe soft as sinews of the newborn babe
p32789
aVAll may be well
p32790
aVNow might I do it pat now he is a-praying
p32791
aVAnd now I\u2019ll do \u2019t
p32792
aVAnd so he goes to heaven
p32793
aVAnd so am I revenged That would be scanned
p32794
aVA villain kills my father and for that
p32795
aVI his sole son do this same villain send
p32796
aVTo heaven
p32797
aVWhy this is hire and salary not revenge
p32798
aVHe took my father grossly full of bread
p32799
aVWith all his crimes broad blown as flush as May
p32800
aVAnd how his audit stands who knows save heaven
p32801
aVBut in our circumstance and course of thought
p32802
aV\u2019Tis heavy with him And am I then revenged
p32803
aVTo take him in the purging of his soul
p32804
aVWhen he is fit and seasoned for his passage
p32805
aVNo
p32806
aVUp sword and know thou a more horrid hent
p32807
aVWhen he is drunk asleep or in his rage
p32808
aVOr in th\u2019 incestuous pleasure of his bed
p32809
aVAt game a-swearing or about some act
p32810
aVThat has no relish of salvation in \u2019t
p32811
aVThen trip him that his heels may kick at heaven
p32812
aVAnd that his soul may be as damned and black
p32813
aVAs hell whereto it goes My mother stays
p32814
aVThis physic but prolongs thy sickly days
p32815
aVMy words fly up my thoughts remain below

aVHe will come straight Look you lay home to him

aVTell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with
p32819
aVAnd that your Grace hath screened and stood between

aVMuch heat and him I\u2019ll silence me even here
p32821
aVPray you be round with him

aVHamlet thou hast thy father much offended

aVMother you have my father much offended
p32824
aVCome come you answer with an idle tongue
p32825
aVGo go you question with a wicked tongue
p32826
aVWhy how now Hamlet
p32827
aVWhat\u2019s the matter now
p32828
aVHave you forgot me
p32829
aVNo by the rood not so
p32830
aVYou are the Queen your husband\u2019s brother\u2019s wife
p32831
aVAnd would it were not so you are my mother

aVCome come and sit you down you shall not budge

aVEven on the pith of life Where is he gone

aVTo draw apart the body he hath killed

p33080
aVBoth countenance and excuse Ho Guildenstern

aVGoes it against the main of Poland sir
p33164
aVOr for some frontier
p33165
aVTruly to speak and with no addition
p33166
aVWe go to gain a little patch of ground
p33167
aVThat hath in it no profit but the name
p33168
aVTo pay five ducats five I would not farm it
p33169
aVNor will it yield to Norway or the Pole
p33170
aVA ranker rate should it be sold in fee
p33171
aVWhy then the Polack never will defend it
p33172
aVYes it is already garrisoned
p33173
aVTwo thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats
p33174
aVWill not debate the question of this straw
p33175
aVThis is th\u2019 impostume of much wealth and peace

aVWhy the man dies I humbly thank you sir

aVSure He that made us with such large discourse
p33186
aVLooking before and after gave us not

aVThat capability and godlike reason
p33188
aVTo fust in us unused Now whether it be
p33189
aVBestial oblivion or some craven scruple
p33190
aVOf thinking too precisely on th\u2019 event
p33191
aVA thought which quartered hath but one part wisdom

p33201
aVTo all that fortune death and danger dare
p33202
aVEven for an eggshell Rightly to be great

aVThat have a father killed a mother stained
p33207
aVExcitements of my reason and my blood
p33208
aVAnd let all sleep while to my shame I see
p33209
aVThe imminent death of twenty thousand men
p33210
aVThat for a fantasy and trick of fame
p33211
aVGo to their graves like beds fight for a plot
p33212
aVWhereon the numbers cannot try the cause
p33213
aVWhich is not tomb enough and continent
p33214
aVTo hide the slain O from this time forth
p33215
aVMy thoughts be bloody or be nothing worth

aVI will not speak with her
p33217
aVShe is importunate

aVWhat would she have
p33220
aVShe speaks much of her father says she hears
p33221
aVThere\u2019s tricks i\u2019 th\u2019 world and hems and beats her heart

aVYet the unshapèd use of it doth move
p33225
aVThe hearers to collection They aim at it
p33226
aVAnd botch the words up fit to their own thoughts
p33227
aVWhich as her winks and nods and gestures yield them
p33228
aVIndeed would make one think there might be thought
p33229

aVSo criminal and so capital in nature

aVAs by your safety greatness wisdom all things else
p33431
aVYou mainly were stirred up
p33432
aVO for two special reasons
p33433
aVWhich may to you perhaps seem much unsinewed
p33434
aVBut yet to me they\u2019re strong The Queen his mother

aVLives almost by his looks and for myself
p33436
aVMy virtue or my plague be it either which
p33437
aVShe is so conjunctive to my life and soul
p33438
aVThat as the star moves not but in his sphere
p33439
aVI could not but by her The other motive
p33440
aVWhy to a public count I might not go

aVConvert his gyves to graces so that my arrows
p33445
aVToo slightly timbered for so loud a wind
p33446
aVWould have reverted to my bow again

aVLetters my lord from Hamlet

aVThese to your Majesty this to the Queen
p33462
aVFrom Hamlet Who brought them

aVOf him that brought them
p33466
aVLaertes you shall hear them
p33467
aVLeave us
p33468
aVWhat should this mean Are all the rest come back
p33469
aVOr is it some abuse and no such thing
p33470
aVKnow you the hand
p33471
aV\u2019Tis Hamlet\u2019s character Naked
p33472
aVAnd in a postscript here he says alone
p33473
aVCan you advise me
p33474
aVI am lost in it my lord But let him come
p33475
aVIt warms the very sickness in my heart
p33476
aVThat I shall live and tell him to his teeth
p33477
aVThus didst thou
p33478
aVIf it be so Laertes
p33479
aVAs how should it be so how otherwise
p33480
aVWill you be ruled by me
p33481
aVAy my lord
p33482
aVSo you will not o\u2019errule me to a peace
p33483
aVTo thine own peace If he be now returned
p33484
aVAs checking at his voyage and that he means
p33485
aVNo more to undertake it I will work him
p33486
aVTo an exploit now ripe in my device
p33487
aVUnder the which he shall not choose but fall
p33488
aVAnd for his death no wind of blame shall breathe
p33489
aVBut even his mother shall uncharge the practice
p33490
aVAnd call it accident
p33491
aVMy lord I will be ruled
p33492
aVThe rather if you could devise it so
p33493
aVThat I might be the organ
p33494
aVIt falls right
p33495
aVYou have been talked of since your travel much
p33496
aVAnd that in Hamlet\u2019s hearing for a quality
p33497
aVWherein they say you shine Your sum of parts
p33498
aVDid not together pluck such envy from him
p33499
aVAs did that one and that in my regard
p33500
aVOf the unworthiest siege
p33501
aVWhat part is that my lord
p33502
aVA very ribbon in the cap of youth
p33503
aVYet needful too for youth no less becomes
p33504
aVThe light and careless livery that it wears

aVThan settled age his sables and his weeds
p33506
aVImporting health and graveness Two months since
p33507
aVHere was a gentleman of Normandy
p33508
aVI have seen myself and served against the French
p33509
aVAnd they can well on horseback but this gallant
p33510
aVHad witchcraft in \u2019t He grew unto his seat
p33511
aVAnd to such wondrous doing brought his horse
p33512
aVAs had he been encorpsed and demi-natured
p33513
aVWith the brave beast So far he topped my thought
p33514
aVThat I in forgery of shapes and tricks
p33515
aVCome short of what he did
p33516
aVA Norman was \u2019t
p33517
aVA Norman

aVUpon my life Lamord
p33519
aVThe very same
p33520
aVI know him well He is the brooch indeed
p33521
aVAnd gem of all the nation
p33522
aVHe made confession of you
p33523
aVAnd gave you such a masterly report
p33524
aVFor art and exercise in your defense
p33525
aVAnd for your rapier most especial
p33526
aVThat he cried out \u2019twould be a sight indeed
p33527
aVIf one could match you The \u2019scrimers of their nation
p33528
aVHe swore had neither motion guard nor eye
p33529
aVIf you opposed them Sir this report of his
p33530
aVDid Hamlet so envenom with his envy
p33531
aVThat he could nothing do but wish and beg
p33532
aVYour sudden coming-o\u2019er to play with you
p33533
aVNow out of this
p33534
aVWhat out of this my lord
p33535
aVLaertes was your father dear to you
p33536
aVOr are you like the painting of a sorrow
p33537
aVA face without a heart
p33538
aVWhy ask you this
p33539
aVNot that I think you did not love your father
p33540
aVBut that I know love is begun by time
p33541
aVAnd that I see in passages of proof
p33542
aVTime qualifies the spark and fire of it
p33543
aVThere lives within the very flame of love
p33544
aVA kind of wick or snuff that will abate it
p33545
aVAnd nothing is at a like goodness still
p33546
aVFor goodness growing to a pleurisy
p33547
aVDies in his own too-much That we would do
p33548
aVWe should do when we would for this would changes
p33549
aVAnd hath abatements and delays as many
p33550
aVAs there are tongues are hands are accidents
p33551
aVAnd then this should is like a spendthrift sigh
p33552
aVThat hurts by easing But to the quick of th\u2019 ulcer
p33553
aVHamlet comes back what would you undertake
p33554
aVTo show yourself indeed your father\u2019s son
p33555
aVMore than in words
p33556
aVTo cut his throat i\u2019 th\u2019 church
p33557
aVNo place indeed should murder sanctuarize
p33558
aVRevenge should have no bounds But good Laertes
p33559
aVWill you do this Keep close within your chamber
p33560
aVHamlet returned shall know you are come home
p33561
aVWe\u2019ll put on those shall praise your excellence
p33562
aVAnd set a double varnish on the fame
p33563
aVThe Frenchman gave you bring you in fine together
p33564
aVAnd wager on your heads He being remiss
p33565
aVMost generous and free from all contriving
p33566
aVWill not peruse the foils so that with ease
p33567
aVOr with a little shuffling you may choose
p33568
aVA sword unbated and in a pass of practice
p33569
aVRequite him for your father
p33570
aVI will do \u2019t
p33571
aVAnd for that purpose I\u2019ll anoint my sword
p33572
aVI bought an unction of a mountebank
p33573
aVSo mortal that but dip a knife in it
p33574
aVWhere it draws blood no cataplasm so rare
p33575
aVCollected from all simples that have virtue
p33576
aVUnder the moon can save the thing from death
p33577
aVThat is but scratched withal I\u2019ll touch my point
p33578
aVWith this contagion that if I gall him slightly
p33579
aVIt may be death
p33580
aVLet\u2019s further think of this
p33581
aVWeigh what convenience both of time and means
p33582
aVMay fit us to our shape If this should fail
p33583
aVAnd that our drift look through our bad performance
p33584
aV\u2019Twere better not assayed Therefore this project
p33585
aVShould have a back or second that might hold
p33586
aVIf this did blast in proof Soft let me see
p33587
aVWe\u2019ll make a solemn wager on your cunnings
p33588
aVI ha \u2019t
p33589
aVWhen in your motion you are hot and dry
p33590
aVAs make your bouts more violent to that end
p33591
aVAnd that he calls for drink I\u2019ll have prepared him
p33592
aVA chalice for the nonce whereon but sipping

aVOur purpose may hold there But stay what noise
p33595
aVOne woe doth tread upon another\u2019s heel
p33596
aVSo fast they follow Your sister\u2019s drowned Laertes
p33597
aVDrowned O where
p33598
aVThere is a willow grows askant the brook
p33599
aVThat shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream
p33600
aVTherewith fantastic garlands did she make
p33601
aVOf crowflowers nettles daisies and long purples
p33602
aVThat liberal shepherds give a grosser name
p33603
aVBut our cold maids do dead men\u2019s fingers call them
p33604
aVThere on the pendant boughs her coronet weeds
p33605
aVClamb\u2019ring to hang an envious sliver broke
p33606
aVWhen down her weedy trophies and herself
p33607
aVFell in the weeping brook Her clothes spread wide
p33608
aVAnd mermaid-like awhile they bore her up
p33609
aVWhich time she chanted snatches of old lauds
p33610
aVAs one incapable of her own distress
p33611
aVOr like a creature native and endued
p33612
aVUnto that element But long it could not be
p33613
aVTill that her garments heavy with their drink
p33614
aVPulled the poor wretch from her melodious lay
p33615
aVTo muddy death
p33616
aVAlas then she is drowned
p33617
aVDrowned drowned
p33618
aVToo much of water hast thou poor Ophelia
p33619
aVAnd therefore I forbid my tears But yet
p33620
aVIt is our trick nature her custom holds
p33621
aVLet shame say what it will When these are gone
p33622
aVThe woman will be out Adieu my lord
p33623
aVI have a speech o\u2019 fire that fain would blaze
p33624
aVBut that this folly drowns it
p33625
aVLet\u2019s follow Gertrude
p33626
aVHow much I had to do to calm his rage
p33627
aVNow fear I this will give it start again

aVRough-hew them how we will

aVUp from my cabin
p33753
aVMy sea-gown scarfed about me in the dark
p33754
aVGroped I to find out them had my desire
p33755
aVFingered their packet and in fine withdrew
p33756
aVTo mine own room again making so bold
p33757
aVMy fears forgetting manners to unfold
p33758
aVTheir grand commission where I found Horatio
p33759
aVA royal knavery an exact command
p33760
aVLarded with many several sorts of reasons
p33761
aVImporting Denmark\u2019s health and England\u2019s too
p33762
aVWith ho such bugs and goblins in my life
p33763
aVThat on the supervise no leisure bated
p33764

aVIs \u2019t possible

aVHere\u2019s the commission Read it at more leisure
p33768
aVBut wilt thou hear now how I did proceed
p33769
aVI beseech you
p33770
aVBeing thus benetted round with villainies
p33771
aVOr I could make a prologue to my brains
p33772
aVThey had begun the play I sat me down
p33773
aVDevised a new commission wrote it fair
p33774
aVI once did hold it as our statists do
p33775
aVA baseness to write fair and labored much

aVHow to forget that learning but sir now
p33777
aVIt did me yeoman\u2019s service Wilt thou know
p33778
aVTh\u2019 effect of what I wrote
p33779
aVAy good my lord
p33780
aVAn earnest conjuration from the King
p33781
aVAs England was his faithful tributary
p33782
aVAs love between them like the palm might flourish
p33783
aVAs peace should still her wheaten garland wear
p33784
aVAnd stand a comma \u2019tween their amities
p33785
aVAnd many suchlike ases of great charge
p33786
aVThat on the view and knowing of these contents
p33787
aVWithout debatement further more or less
p33788
aVHe should those bearers put to sudden death
p33789
aVNot shriving time allowed
p33790
aVHow was this sealed
p33791
aVWhy even in that was heaven ordinant
p33792
aVI had my father\u2019s signet in my purse
p33793
aVWhich was the model of that Danish seal
p33794
aVFolded the writ up in the form of th\u2019 other

aVSubscribed it gave \u2019t th\u2019 impression placed it safely
p33796
aVThe changeling never known Now the next day
p33797
aVWas our sea-fight and what to this was sequent
p33798
aVThou knowest already
p33799
aVSo Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to \u2019t
p33800
aVWhy man they did make love to this employment
p33801
aVThey are not near my conscience Their defeat
p33802
aVDoes by their own insinuation grow
p33803
aV\u2019Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes
p33804
aVBetween the pass and fell incensèd points
p33805
aVOf mighty opposites
p33806
aVWhy what a king is this
p33807
aVDoes it not think thee stand me now upon
p33808
aVHe that hath killed my king and whored my mother
p33809
aVPopped in between th\u2019 election and my hopes
p33810
aVThrown out his angle for my proper life
p33811
aVAnd with such cozenage is \u2019t not perfect conscience
p33812
aVTo quit him with this arm And is \u2019t not to be damned
p33813
aVTo let this canker of our nature come
p33814
aVIn further evil
p33815
aVIt must be shortly known to him from England
p33816
aVWhat is the issue of the business there
p33817
aVIt will be short The interim\u2019s mine
p33818
aVAnd a man\u2019s life\u2019s no more than to say one
p33819
aVBut I am very sorry good Horatio
p33820
aVThat to Laertes I forgot myself
p33821
aVFor by the image of my cause I see
p33822
aVThe portraiture of his I\u2019ll court his favors
p33823
aVBut sure the bravery of his grief did put me
p33824
aVInto a tow\u2019ring passion
p33825
aVPeace who comes here
p33826
aVCome Hamlet come and take this hand from me
p33827
aVGive me your pardon sir I have done you wrong
p33828
aVBut pardon \u2019t as you are a gentleman This presence knows
p33829
aVAnd you must needs have heard how I am punished
p33830
aVWith a sore distraction What I have done
p33831
aVThat might your nature honor and exception
p33832
aVRoughly awake I here proclaim was madness
p33833
aVWas \u2019t Hamlet wronged Laertes Never Hamlet
p33834
aVIf Hamlet from himself be ta\u2019en away
p33835
aVAnd when he\u2019s not himself does wrong Laertes
p33836
aVThen Hamlet does it not Hamlet denies it
p33837
aVWho does it then His madness If \u2019t be so
p33838
aVHamlet is of the faction that is wronged
p33839
aVHis madness is poor Hamlet\u2019s enemy
p33840
aVSir in this audience
p33841
aVLet my disclaiming from a purposed evil
p33842
aVFree me so far in your most generous thoughts
p33843
aVThat I have shot my arrow o\u2019er the house
p33844
aVAnd hurt my brother
p33845
aVI am satisfied in nature
p33846
aVWhose motive in this case should stir me most
p33847
aVTo my revenge but in my terms of honor
p33848
aVI stand aloof and will no reconcilement
p33849
aVTill by some elder masters of known honor
p33850

p33851
aVTo keep my name ungored But till that time

aVThis quarry cries on havoc O proud Death
p33981
aVWhat feast is toward in thine eternal cell
p33982
aVThat thou so many princes at a shot
p33983
aVSo bloodily hast struck
p33984
aVThe sight is dismal
p33985
aVAnd our affairs from England come too late
p33986
aVThe ears are senseless that should give us hearing
p33987
aVTo tell him his commandment is fulfilled
p33988
aVThat Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead
p33989
aVWhere should we have our thanks
p33990
aVNot from his mouth
p33991
aVHad it th\u2019 ability of life to thank you
p33992
aVHe never gave commandment for their death
p33993
aVBut since so jump upon this bloody question

aVYou from the Polack wars and you from England

aVAre here arrived give order that these bodies

aVHigh on a stage be placed to the view
p33997
aVAnd let me speak to th\u2019 yet unknowing world
p33998
aVHow these things came about So shall you hear
p33999
aVOf carnal bloody and unnatural acts
p34000
aVOf accidental judgments casual slaughters
p34001
aVOf deaths put on by cunning and forced cause
p34002
aVAnd in this upshot purposes mistook
p34003
aVFall\u2019n on th\u2019 inventors\u2019 heads All this can I
p34004
aVTruly deliver
p34005
aVLet us haste to hear it
p34006
aVAnd call the noblest to the audience
p34007
aVFor me with sorrow I embrace my fortune
p34008
aVI have some rights of memory in this kingdom
p34009
aVWhich now to claim my vantage doth invite me
p34010
aVOf that I shall have also cause to speak
p34011
aVAnd from his mouth whose voice will draw on more
p34012
aVBut let this same be presently performed
p34013
aVEven while men\u2019s minds are wild lest more mischance
p34014
aVOn plots and errors happen
p34015
aVLet four captains
p34016
aVBear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage
p34017
aVFor he was likely had he been put on

aVGo bid the soldiers shoot
p34024
aVHence Home you idle creatures get you home
p34025
aVIs this a holiday What know you not
p34026
aVBeing mechanical you ought not walk
p34027
aVUpon a laboring day without the sign
p34028
aVOf your profession Speak what trade art thou
p34029
aVWhere is thy leather apron and thy rule
p34030
aVWhat dost thou with thy best apparel on
p34031
aVYou sir what trade are you
p34032
aVBut what trade art thou Answer me directly
p34033
aVWhat trade thou knave Thou naughty knave what trade
p34034
aVWhat mean\u2019st thou by that Mend me thou saucy fellow
p34035
aVBut wherefore art not in thy shop today
p34036
aVWhy dost thou lead these men about the streets
p34037
aVWherefore rejoice What conquest brings he home
p34038
aVWhat tributaries follow him to Rome
p34039
aVTo grace in captive bonds his chariot wheels
p34040
aVYou blocks you stones you worse than senseless things
p34041
aVO you hard hearts you cruel men of Rome
p34042
aVKnew you not Pompey Many a time and oft
p34043
aVHave you climbed up to walls and battlements
p34044
aVTo towers and windows yea to chimney tops
p34045
aVYour infants in your arms and there have sat
p34046
aVThe livelong day with patient expectation
p34047
aVTo see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome
p34048
aVAnd when you saw his chariot but appear
p34049
aVHave you not made an universal shout
p34050
aVThat Tiber trembled underneath her banks
p34051
aVTo hear the replication of your sounds
p34052
aVMade in her concave shores
p34053
aVAnd do you now put on your best attire
p34054
aVAnd do you now cull out a holiday
p34055
aVAnd do you now strew flowers in his way
p34056
aVThat comes in triumph over Pompey\u2019s blood
p34057
aVBe gone
p34058
aVRun to your houses fall upon your knees
p34059
aVPray to the gods to intermit the plague
p34060
aVThat needs must light on this ingratitude
p34061
aVGo go good countrymen and for this fault
p34062
aVAssemble all the poor men of your sort
p34063
aVDraw them to Tiber banks and weep your tears
p34064
aVInto the channel till the lowest stream
p34065
aVDo kiss the most exalted shores of all
p34066
aVSee whe\u2019er their basest mettle be not moved
p34067
aVThey vanish tongue-tied in their guiltiness
p34068
aVGo you down that way towards the Capitol
p34069
aVThis way will I Disrobe the images
p34070
aVIf you do find them decked with ceremonies
p34071
aVMay we do so
p34072
aVYou know it is the feast of Lupercal
p34073
aVIt is no matter Let no images
p34074
aVBe hung with Caesar\u2019s trophies I\u2019ll about
p34075
aVAnd drive away the vulgar from the streets
p34076
aVSo do you too where you perceive them thick
p34077
aVThese growing feathers plucked from Caesar\u2019s wing
p34078
aVWill make him fly an ordinary pitch
p34079
aVWho else would soar above the view of men
p34080
aVAnd keep us all in servile fearfulness
p34081
aVCalphurnia
p34082
aVPeace ho Caesar speaks
p34083
aVCalphurnia

aVWhen he doth run his course Antonius

p34087
aVTo touch Calphurnia for our elders say
p34088
aVThe barren touchèd in this holy chase
p34089
aVShake off their sterile curse
p34090
aVI shall remember
p34091
aVWhen Caesar says Do this it is performed
p34092
aVSet on and leave no ceremony out
p34093
aVBid every noise be still Peace yet again
p34094
aVWho is it in the press that calls on me
p34095
aVI hear a tongue shriller than all the music
p34096
aVCry Caesar Speak Caesar is turned to hear
p34097
aVBeware the ides of March
p34098
aVWhat man is that
p34099
aVA soothsayer bids you beware the ides of March
p34100
aVSet him before me Let me see his face
p34101
aVFellow come from the throng
p34102
aVLook upon Caesar
p34103
aVWhat sayst thou to me now Speak once again
p34104
aVBeware the ides of March
p34105
aVHe is a dreamer Let us leave him Pass
p34106
aVWill you go see the order of the course
p34107
aVNot I
p34108
aVI pray you do
p34109
aVI am not gamesome I do lack some part
p34110
aVOf that quick spirit that is in Antony
p34111
aVLet me not hinder Cassius your desires
p34112
aVI\u2019ll leave you
p34113
aVBrutus I do observe you now of late
p34114
aVI have not from your eyes that gentleness
p34115
aVAnd show of love as I was wont to have
p34116
aVYou bear too stubborn and too strange a hand
p34117
aVOver your friend that loves you
p34118
aVCassius
p34119
aVBe not deceived If I have veiled my look
p34120
aVI turn the trouble of my countenance
p34121
aVMerely upon myself Vexèd I am
p34122
aVOf late with passions of some difference
p34123
aVConceptions only proper to myself
p34124
aVWhich give some soil perhaps to my behaviors
p34125
aVBut let not therefore my good friends be grieved
p34126
aVAmong which number Cassius be you one
p34127
aVNor construe any further my neglect
p34128
aVThan that poor Brutus with himself at war
p34129
aVForgets the shows of love to other men
p34130
aVThen Brutus I have much mistook your passion
p34131
aVBy means whereof this breast of mine hath buried
p34132
aVThoughts of great value worthy cogitations
p34133
aVTell me good Brutus can you see your face
p34134
aVNo Cassius for the eye sees not itself
p34135
aVBut by reflection by some other things
p34136
aV\u2019Tis just
p34137
aVAnd it is very much lamented Brutus
p34138
aVThat you have no such mirrors as will turn
p34139
aVYour hidden worthiness into your eye
p34140
aVThat you might see your shadow I have heard
p34141
aVWhere many of the best respect in Rome
p34142
aVExcept immortal Caesar speaking of Brutus
p34143
aVAnd groaning underneath this age\u2019s yoke
p34144
aVHave wished that noble Brutus had his eyes
p34145
aVInto what dangers would you lead me Cassius
p34146
aVThat you would have me seek into myself
p34147
aVFor that which is not in me
p34148
aVTherefore good Brutus be prepared to hear
p34149
aVAnd since you know you cannot see yourself
p34150
aVSo well as by reflection I your glass
p34151
aVWill modestly discover to yourself
p34152
aVThat of yourself which you yet know not of
p34153
aVAnd be not jealous on me gentle Brutus
p34154
aVWere I a common laughter or did use
p34155
aVTo stale with ordinary oaths my love
p34156
aVTo every new protester if you know
p34157
aVThat I do fawn on men and hug them hard
p34158
aVAnd after scandal them or if you know
p34159
aVThat I profess myself in banqueting
p34160
aVTo all the rout then hold me dangerous
p34161
aVWhat means this shouting I do fear the people
p34162
aVChoose Caesar for their king
p34163
aVAy do you fear it
p34164
aVThen must I think you would not have it so
p34165
aVI would not Cassius yet I love him well
p34166
aVBut wherefore do you hold me here so long
p34167
aVWhat is it that you would impart to me
p34168
aVIf it be aught toward the general good
p34169
aVSet honor in one eye and death i\u2019 th\u2019 other
p34170
aVAnd I will look on both indifferently
p34171
aVFor let the gods so speed me as I love
p34172
aVThe name of honor more than I fear death
p34173
aVI know that virtue to be in you Brutus
p34174
aVAs well as I do know your outward favor
p34175
aVWell honor is the subject of my story
p34176
aVI cannot tell what you and other men
p34177
aVThink of this life but for my single self
p34178
aVI had as lief not be as live to be
p34179
aVIn awe of such a thing as I myself
p34180
aVI was born free as Caesar so were you
p34181
aVWe both have fed as well and we can both
p34182
aVEndure the winter\u2019s cold as well as he
p34183
aVFor once upon a raw and gusty day
p34184
aVThe troubled Tiber chafing with her shores
p34185
aVCaesar said to me Dar\u2019st thou Cassius now
p34186
aVLeap in with me into this angry flood
p34187
aVAnd swim to yonder point Upon the word
p34188
aVAccoutered as I was I plungèd in
p34189
aVAnd bade him follow so indeed he did
p34190
aVThe torrent roared and we did buffet it
p34191
aVWith lusty sinews throwing it aside
p34192
aVAnd stemming it with hearts of controversy
p34193
aVBut ere we could arrive the point proposed
p34194
aVCaesar cried Help me Cassius or I sink
p34195
aVI as Aeneas our great ancestor
p34196
aVDid from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder
p34197
aVThe old Anchises bear so from the waves of Tiber
p34198
aVDid I the tired Caesar And this man
p34199
aVIs now become a god and Cassius is
p34200
aVA wretched creature and must bend his body
p34201
aVIf Caesar carelessly but nod on him
p34202
aVHe had a fever when he was in Spain
p34203
aVAnd when the fit was on him I did mark
p34204
aVHow he did shake \u2019Tis true this god did shake
p34205
aVHis coward lips did from their color fly
p34206
aVAnd that same eye whose bend doth awe the world
p34207
aVDid lose his luster I did hear him groan
p34208
aVAy and that tongue of his that bade the Romans
p34209
aVMark him and write his speeches in their books
p34210
aVAlas it cried Give me some drink Titinius
p34211
aVAs a sick girl You gods it doth amaze me
p34212
aVA man of such a feeble temper should
p34213
aVSo get the start of the majestic world
p34214
aVAnd bear the palm alone
p34215
aVAnother general shout
p34216
aVI do believe that these applauses are
p34217
aVFor some new honors that are heaped on Caesar
p34218
aVWhy man he doth bestride the narrow world
p34219
aVLike a Colossus and we petty men
p34220
aVWalk under his huge legs and peep about
p34221
aVTo find ourselves dishonorable graves
p34222
aVMen at some time are masters of their fates
p34223
aVThe fault dear Brutus is not in our stars
p34224
aVBut in ourselves that we are underlings
p34225
aVBrutus and Caesar what should be in that Caesar
p34226
aVWhy should that name be sounded more than yours
p34227
aVWrite them together yours is as fair a name
p34228
aVSound them it doth become the mouth as well
p34229
aVWeigh them it is as heavy conjure with \u2019em
p34230
aVBrutus will start a spirit as soon as Caesar
p34231
aVNow in the names of all the gods at once
p34232
aVUpon what meat doth this our Caesar feed
p34233
aVThat he is grown so great Age thou art shamed
p34234
aVRome thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods
p34235
aVWhen went there by an age since the great flood
p34236
aVBut it was famed with more than with one man
p34237
aVWhen could they say till now that talked of Rome
p34238
aVThat her wide walks encompassed but one man
p34239
aVNow is it Rome indeed and room enough
p34240
aVWhen there is in it but one only man
p34241
aVO you and I have heard our fathers say
p34242
aVThere was a Brutus once that would have brooked
p34243
aVTh\u2019 eternal devil to keep his state in Rome
p34244
aVAs easily as a king
p34245
aVThat you do love me I am nothing jealous
p34246
aVWhat you would work me to I have some aim
p34247
aVHow I have thought of this and of these times
p34248
aVI shall recount hereafter For this present
p34249
aVI would not so with love I might entreat you
p34250
aVBe any further moved What you have said
p34251
aVI will consider what you have to say
p34252
aVI will with patience hear and find a time
p34253
aVBoth meet to hear and answer such high things
p34254
aVTill then my noble friend chew upon this
p34255
aVBrutus had rather be a villager
p34256
aVThan to repute himself a son of Rome
p34257
aVUnder these hard conditions as this time
p34258
aVIs like to lay upon us
p34259
aVI am glad that my weak words
p34260
aVHave struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus
p34261
aVThe games are done and Caesar is returning
p34262
aVAs they pass by pluck Casca by the sleeve
p34263
aVAnd he will after his sour fashion tell you
p34264
aVWhat hath proceeded worthy note today
p34265
aVI will do so But look you Cassius
p34266
aVThe angry spot doth glow on Caesar\u2019s brow
p34267
aVAnd all the rest look like a chidden train
p34268
aVCalphurnia\u2019s cheek is pale and Cicero
p34269
aVLooks with such ferret and such fiery eyes
p34270
aVAs we have seen him in the Capitol
p34271
aVBeing crossed in conference by some senators
p34272
aVCasca will tell us what the matter is
p34273
aVAntonius
p34274
aVCaesar
p34275
aVLet me have men about me that are fat
p34276
aVSleek-headed men and such as sleep a-nights
p34277
aVYond Cassius has a lean and hungry look
p34278
aVHe thinks too much Such men are dangerous
p34279
aVFear him not Caesar he\u2019s not dangerous
p34280
aVHe is a noble Roman and well given
p34281
aVWould he were fatter But I fear him not
p34282
aVYet if my name were liable to fear
p34283
aVI do not know the man I should avoid
p34284
aVSo soon as that spare Cassius He reads much
p34285
aVHe is a great observer and he looks
p34286
aVQuite through the deeds of men He loves no plays
p34287
aVAs thou dost Antony he hears no music
p34288
aVSeldom he smiles and smiles in such a sort
p34289
aVAs if he mocked himself and scorned his spirit
p34290
aVThat could be moved to smile at anything
p34291
aVSuch men as he be never at heart\u2019s ease
p34292
aVWhiles they behold a greater than themselves
p34293
aVAnd therefore are they very dangerous
p34294
aVI rather tell thee what is to be feared
p34295
aVThan what I fear for always I am Caesar
p34296
aVCome on my right hand for this ear is deaf
p34297
aVAnd tell me truly what thou think\u2019st of him
p34298
aVAy Casca Tell us what hath chanced today
p34299
aVThat Caesar looks so sad
p34300
aVI should not then ask Casca what had chanced
p34301
aVThey shouted thrice What was the last cry for
p34302
aVTell us the manner of it gentle Casca
p34303
aVBut soft I pray you What did Caesar swoon
p34304
aV\u2019Tis very like he hath the falling sickness
p34305
aVNo Caesar hath it not but you and I
p34306
aVAnd honest Casca we have the falling sickness
p34307
aVWhat said he when he came unto himself
p34308
aVAnd after that he came thus sad away
p34309
aVWhat a blunt fellow is this grown to be
p34310
aVHe was quick mettle when he went to school
p34311
aVSo is he now in execution
p34312
aVOf any bold or noble enterprise
p34313
aVHowever he puts on this tardy form
p34314
aVThis rudeness is a sauce to his good wit
p34315
aVWhich gives men stomach to digest his words
p34316
aVWith better appetite
p34317
aVAnd so it is For this time I will leave you
p34318
aVTomorrow if you please to speak with me
p34319
aVI will come home to you or if you will
p34320
aVCome home to me and I will wait for you
p34321
aVI will do so Till then think of the world
p34322
aVWell Brutus thou art noble Yet I see
p34323
aVThy honorable mettle may be wrought
p34324
aVFrom that it is disposed Therefore it is meet
p34325
aVThat noble minds keep ever with their likes
p34326
aVFor who so firm that cannot be seduced
p34327
aVCaesar doth bear me hard but he loves Brutus
p34328
aVIf I were Brutus now and he were Cassius
p34329
aVHe should not humor me I will this night
p34330
aVIn several hands in at his windows throw
p34331
aVAs if they came from several citizens
p34332
aVWritings all tending to the great opinion
p34333
aVThat Rome holds of his name wherein obscurely
p34334
aVCaesar\u2019s ambition shall be glancèd at
p34335
aVAnd after this let Caesar seat him sure
p34336
aVFor we will shake him or worse days endure
p34337
aVGood even Casca Brought you Caesar home
p34338
aVWhy are you breathless And why stare you so
p34339
aVAre not you moved when all the sway of earth
p34340
aVShakes like a thing unfirm O Cicero
p34341
aVI have seen tempests when the scolding winds
p34342
aVHave rived the knotty oaks and I have seen
p34343
aVTh\u2019 ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam
p34344
aVTo be exalted with the threat\u2019ning clouds
p34345
aVBut never till tonight never till now
p34346
aVDid I go through a tempest dropping fire
p34347
aVEither there is a civil strife in heaven
p34348
aVOr else the world too saucy with the gods
p34349
aVIncenses them to send destruction
p34350
aVWhy saw you anything more wonderful
p34351
aVA common slave you know him well by sight
p34352
aVHeld up his left hand which did flame and burn
p34353
aVLike twenty torches joined and yet his hand
p34354
aVNot sensible of fire remained unscorched
p34355
aVBesides I ha\u2019 not since put up my sword
p34356
aVAgainst the Capitol I met a lion
p34357
aVWho glazed upon me and went surly by
p34358
aVWithout annoying me And there were drawn
p34359
aVUpon a heap a hundred ghastly women
p34360
aVTransformèd with their fear who swore they saw
p34361
aVMen all in fire walk up and down the streets
p34362
aVAnd yesterday the bird of night did sit
p34363
aVEven at noonday upon the marketplace
p34364
aVHooting and shrieking When these prodigies
p34365
aVDo so conjointly meet let not men say
p34366
aVThese are their reasons they are natural
p34367
aVFor I believe they are portentous things
p34368
aVUnto the climate that they point upon
p34369
aVIndeed it is a strange-disposèd time
p34370
aVBut men may construe things after their fashion
p34371
aVClean from the purpose of the things themselves
p34372
aVComes Caesar to the Capitol tomorrow
p34373
aVHe doth for he did bid Antonius
p34374
aVSend word to you he would be there tomorrow
p34375
aVGood night then Casca This disturbèd sky
p34376
aVIs not to walk in
p34377
aVFarewell Cicero
p34378
aVWho\u2019s there
p34379
aVA Roman
p34380
aVCasca by your voice
p34381
aVYour ear is good Cassius what night is this
p34382
aVA very pleasing night to honest men
p34383
aVWho ever knew the heavens menace so
p34384
aVThose that have known the Earth so full of faults
p34385
aVFor my part I have walked about the streets
p34386
aVSubmitting me unto the perilous night
p34387
aVAnd thus unbracèd Casca as you see
p34388
aVHave bared my bosom to the thunder-stone
p34389
aVAnd when the cross blue lightning seemed to open
p34390
aVThe breast of heaven I did present myself
p34391
aVEven in the aim and very flash of it
p34392
aVBut wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens
p34393
aVIt is the part of men to fear and tremble
p34394
aVWhen the most mighty gods by tokens send
p34395
aVSuch dreadful heralds to astonish us
p34396
aVYou are dull Casca and those sparks of life
p34397
aVThat should be in a Roman you do want
p34398
aVOr else you use not You look pale and gaze
p34399
aVAnd put on fear and cast yourself in wonder
p34400
aVTo see the strange impatience of the heavens
p34401
aVBut if you would consider the true cause
p34402
aVWhy all these fires why all these gliding ghosts
p34403
aVWhy birds and beasts from quality and kind
p34404
aVWhy old men fools and children calculate
p34405
aVWhy all these things change from their ordinance
p34406
aVTheir natures and preformèd faculties
p34407
aVTo monstrous quality why you shall find
p34408
aVThat heaven hath infused them with these spirits
p34409
aVTo make them instruments of fear and warning
p34410
aVUnto some monstrous state
p34411
aVNow could I Casca name to thee a man
p34412
aVMost like this dreadful night
p34413
aVThat thunders lightens opens graves and roars
p34414
aVAs doth the lion in the Capitol
p34415
aVA man no mightier than thyself or me
p34416
aVIn personal action yet prodigious grown
p34417
aVAnd fearful as these strange eruptions are
p34418
aV\u2019Tis Caesar that you mean is it not Cassius
p34419
aVLet it be who it is For Romans now
p34420
aVHave thews and limbs like to their ancestors
p34421
aVBut woe the while our fathers\u2019 minds are dead
p34422
aVAnd we are governed with our mothers\u2019 spirits
p34423
aVOur yoke and sufferance show us womanish
p34424
aVIndeed they say the Senators tomorrow
p34425
aVMean to establish Caesar as a king
p34426
aVAnd he shall wear his crown by sea and land
p34427
aVIn every place save here in Italy
p34428
aVI know where I will wear this dagger then
p34429
aVCassius from bondage will deliver Cassius
p34430
aVTherein you gods you make the weak most strong
p34431
aVTherein you gods you tyrants do defeat
p34432
aVNor stony tower nor walls of beaten brass
p34433
aVNor airless dungeon nor strong links of iron
p34434
aVCan be retentive to the strength of spirit
p34435
aVBut life being weary of these worldly bars
p34436
aVNever lacks power to dismiss itself
p34437
aVIf I know this know all the world besides
p34438
aVThat part of tyranny that I do bear
p34439
aVI can shake off at pleasure
p34440
aVSo can I
p34441
aVSo every bondman in his own hand bears
p34442
aVThe power to cancel his captivity
p34443
aVAnd why should Caesar be a tyrant then
p34444
aVPoor man I know he would not be a wolf
p34445
aVBut that he sees the Romans are but sheep
p34446
aVHe were no lion were not Romans hinds
p34447
aVThose that with haste will make a mighty fire
p34448
aVBegin it with weak straws What trash is Rome
p34449
aVWhat rubbish and what offal when it serves
p34450
aVFor the base matter to illuminate
p34451
aVSo vile a thing as Caesar But O grief
p34452
aVWhere hast thou led me I perhaps speak this
p34453
aVBefore a willing bondman then I know
p34454
aVMy answer must be made But I am armed
p34455
aVAnd dangers are to me indifferent
p34456
aVYou speak to Casca and to such a man
p34457
aVThat is no fleering telltale Hold My hand
p34458
aVBe factious for redress of all these griefs
p34459
aVAnd I will set this foot of mine as far
p34460
aVAs who goes farthest
p34461
aVThere\u2019s a bargain made
p34462
aVNow know you Casca I have moved already
p34463
aVSome certain of the noblest-minded Romans
p34464
aVTo undergo with me an enterprise
p34465
aVOf honorable-dangerous consequence
p34466
aVAnd I do know by this they stay for me
p34467
aVIn Pompey\u2019s Porch For now this fearful night
p34468
aVThere is no stir or walking in the streets
p34469
aVAnd the complexion of the element
p34470
aVIn favor \u2019s like the work we have in hand
p34471
aVMost bloody fiery and most terrible
p34472
aVStand close awhile for here comes one in haste
p34473
aV\u2019Tis Cinna I do know him by his gait
p34474
aVHe is a friend Cinna where haste you so
p34475
aVTo find out you Who\u2019s that Metellus Cimber
p34476
aVNo it is Casca one incorporate
p34477
aVTo our attempts Am I not stayed for Cinna
p34478
aVI am glad on \u2019t What a fearful night is this
p34479
aVThere\u2019s two or three of us have seen strange sights
p34480
aVAm I not stayed for Tell me
p34481
aVYes you are O Cassius if you could
p34482
aVBut win the noble Brutus to our party
p34483
aVBe you content Good Cinna take this paper
p34484
aVAnd look you lay it in the Praetor\u2019s chair
p34485
aVWhere Brutus may but find it and throw this
p34486
aVIn at his window set this up with wax
p34487
aVUpon old Brutus\u2019 statue All this done
p34488
aVRepair to Pompey\u2019s Porch where you shall find us
p34489
aVIs Decius Brutus and Trebonius there
p34490
aVAll but Metellus Cimber and he\u2019s gone
p34491
aVTo seek you at your house Well I will hie
p34492
aVAnd so bestow these papers as you bade me
p34493
aVThat done repair to Pompey\u2019s Theater
p34494
aVCome Casca you and I will yet ere day
p34495
aVSee Brutus at his house Three parts of him
p34496
aVIs ours already and the man entire
p34497
aVUpon the next encounter yields him ours
p34498
aVO he sits high in all the people\u2019s hearts
p34499
aVAnd that which would appear offense in us
p34500
aVHis countenance like richest alchemy
p34501
aVWill change to virtue and to worthiness
p34502
aVHim and his worth and our great need of him
p34503
aVYou have right well conceited Let us go
p34504
aVFor it is after midnight and ere day
p34505
aVWe will awake him and be sure of him
p34506
aVWhat Lucius ho
p34507
aVI cannot by the progress of the stars
p34508
aVGive guess how near to day Lucius I say
p34509
aVI would it were my fault to sleep so soundly
p34510
aVWhen Lucius when Awake I say What Lucius
p34511
aVGet me a taper in my study Lucius
p34512
aVWhen it is lighted come and call me here
p34513
aVIt must be by his death And for my part
p34514
aVI know no personal cause to spurn at him
p34515
aVBut for the general He would be crowned
p34516
aVHow that might change his nature there\u2019s the question
p34517
aVIt is the bright day that brings forth the adder
p34518
aVAnd that craves wary walking Crown him that
p34519
aVAnd then I grant we put a sting in him
p34520
aVThat at his will he may do danger with
p34521
aVTh\u2019 abuse of greatness is when it disjoins
p34522
aVRemorse from power And to speak truth of Caesar
p34523
aVI have not known when his affections swayed
p34524
aVMore than his reason But \u2019tis a common proof
p34525
aVThat lowliness is young ambition\u2019s ladder
p34526
aVWhereto the climber-upward turns his face
p34527
aVBut when he once attains the upmost round
p34528
aVHe then unto the ladder turns his back
p34529
aVLooks in the clouds scorning the base degrees
p34530
aVBy which he did ascend So Caesar may
p34531
aVThen lest he may prevent And since the quarrel
p34532
aVWill bear no color for the thing he is
p34533
aVFashion it thus that what he is augmented
p34534
aVWould run to these and these extremities
p34535
aVAnd therefore think him as a serpent\u2019s egg
p34536
aVWhich hatched would as his kind grow mischievous
p34537
aVAnd kill him in the shell
p34538
aVThe taper burneth in your closet sir
p34539
aVSearching the window for a flint I found
p34540
aVThis paper thus sealed up and I am sure
p34541
aVIt did not lie there when I went to bed
p34542
aVGet you to bed again It is not day
p34543
aVIs not tomorrow boy the ides of March
p34544
aVLook in the calendar and bring me word
p34545
aVThe exhalations whizzing in the air
p34546
aVGive so much light that I may read by them
p34547
aVBrutus thou sleep\u2019st Awake and see thyself
p34548
aVShall Rome etc. Speak strike redress
p34549
aVBrutus thou sleep\u2019st Awake
p34550
aVSuch instigations have been often dropped
p34551
aVWhere I have took them up
p34552
aVShall Rome etc. Thus must I piece it out
p34553
aVShall Rome stand under one man\u2019s awe What Rome
p34554
aVMy ancestors did from the streets of Rome
p34555
aVThe Tarquin drive when he was called a king
p34556
aVSpeak strike redress Am I entreated
p34557
aVTo speak and strike O Rome I make thee promise
p34558
aVIf the redress will follow thou receivest
p34559
aVThy full petition at the hand of Brutus
p34560
aVSir March is wasted fifteen days
p34561
aV\u2019Tis good Go to the gate somebody knocks
p34562
aVSince Cassius first did whet me against Caesar
p34563
aVI have not slept
p34564
aVBetween the acting of a dreadful thing
p34565
aVAnd the first motion all the interim is
p34566
aVLike a phantasma or a hideous dream
p34567
aVThe genius and the mortal instruments
p34568
aVAre then in council and the state of man
p34569
aVLike to a little kingdom suffers then
p34570
aVThe nature of an insurrection
p34571
aVSir \u2019tis your brother Cassius at the door
p34572
aVWho doth desire to see you
p34573
aVIs he alone
p34574
aVNo sir There are more with him
p34575
aVDo you know them
p34576
aVNo sir Their hats are plucked about their ears
p34577
aVAnd half their faces buried in their cloaks
p34578
aVThat by no means I may discover them
p34579
aVBy any mark of favor
p34580
aVLet \u2019em enter
p34581
aVThey are the faction O conspiracy
p34582
aVSham\u2019st thou to show thy dang\u2019rous brow by night
p34583
aVWhen evils are most free O then by day
p34584
aVWhere wilt thou find a cavern dark enough
p34585
aVTo mask thy monstrous visage Seek none conspiracy
p34586
aVHide it in smiles and affability
p34587
aVFor if thou path thy native semblance on
p34588
aVNot Erebus itself were dim enough
p34589
aVTo hide thee from prevention
p34590
aVI think we are too bold upon your rest
p34591
aVGood morrow Brutus Do we trouble you
p34592
aVI have been up this hour awake all night
p34593
aVKnow I these men that come along with you
p34594
aVYes every man of them and no man here
p34595
aVBut honors you and every one doth wish
p34596
aVYou had but that opinion of yourself
p34597
aVWhich every noble Roman bears of you
p34598
aVThis is Trebonius
p34599
aVHe is welcome hither
p34600
aVThis Decius Brutus
p34601
aVHe is welcome too
p34602
aVThis Casca this Cinna and this Metellus Cimber
p34603
aVThey are all welcome
p34604
aVWhat watchful cares do interpose themselves
p34605
aVBetwixt your eyes and night
p34606
aVShall I entreat a word
p34607
aVHere lies the east doth not the day break here
p34608
aVO pardon sir it doth and yon gray lines
p34609
aVThat fret the clouds are messengers of day
p34610
aVYou shall confess that you are both deceived
p34611
aVHere as I point my sword the sun arises
p34612
aVWhich is a great way growing on the south
p34613
aVWeighing the youthful season of the year
p34614
aVSome two months hence up higher toward the north
p34615
aVHe first presents his fire and the high east
p34616
aVStands as the Capitol directly here
p34617
aVGive me your hands all over one by one
p34618
aVAnd let us swear our resolution
p34619
aVNo not an oath If not the face of men
p34620
aVThe sufferance of our souls the time\u2019s abuse
p34621
aVIf these be motives weak break off betimes
p34622
aVAnd every man hence to his idle bed
p34623
aVSo let high-sighted tyranny range on
p34624
aVTill each man drop by lottery But if these
p34625
aVAs I am sure they do bear fire enough
p34626
aVTo kindle cowards and to steel with valor
p34627
aVThe melting spirits of women then countrymen
p34628
aVWhat need we any spur but our own cause
p34629
aVTo prick us to redress What other bond
p34630
aVThan secret Romans that have spoke the word
p34631
aVAnd will not palter And what other oath
p34632
aVThan honesty to honesty engaged
p34633
aVThat this shall be or we will fall for it
p34634
aVSwear priests and cowards and men cautelous
p34635
aVOld feeble carrions and such suffering souls
p34636
aVThat welcome wrongs unto bad causes swear
p34637
aVSuch creatures as men doubt but do not stain
p34638
aVThe even virtue of our enterprise
p34639
aVNor th\u2019 insuppressive mettle of our spirits
p34640
aVTo think that or our cause or our performance
p34641
aVDid need an oath when every drop of blood
p34642
aVThat every Roman bears and nobly bears
p34643
aVIs guilty of a several bastardy
p34644
aVIf he do break the smallest particle
p34645
aVOf any promise that hath passed from him
p34646
aVBut what of Cicero Shall we sound him
p34647
aVI think he will stand very strong with us
p34648
aVLet us not leave him out
p34649
aVNo by no means
p34650
aVO let us have him for his silver hairs
p34651
aVWill purchase us a good opinion
p34652
aVAnd buy men\u2019s voices to commend our deeds
p34653
aVIt shall be said his judgment ruled our hands
p34654
aVOur youths and wildness shall no whit appear
p34655
aVBut all be buried in his gravity
p34656
aVO name him not Let us not break with him
p34657
aVFor he will never follow anything
p34658
aVThat other men begin
p34659
aVThen leave him out
p34660
aVIndeed he is not fit
p34661
aVShall no man else be touched but only Caesar
p34662
aVDecius well urged I think it is not meet
p34663
aVMark Antony so well beloved of Caesar
p34664
aVShould outlive Caesar We shall find of him
p34665
aVA shrewd contriver and you know his means
p34666
aVIf he improve them may well stretch so far
p34667
aVAs to annoy us all which to prevent
p34668
aVLet Antony and Caesar fall together
p34669
aVOur course will seem too bloody Caius Cassius
p34670
aVTo cut the head off and then hack the limbs
p34671
aVLike wrath in death and envy afterwards
p34672
aVFor Antony is but a limb of Caesar
p34673
aVLet\u2019s be sacrificers but not butchers Caius
p34674
aVWe all stand up against the spirit of Caesar
p34675
aVAnd in the spirit of men there is no blood
p34676
aVO that we then could come by Caesar\u2019s spirit
p34677
aVAnd not dismember Caesar But alas
p34678
aVCaesar must bleed for it And gentle friends
p34679
aVLet\u2019s kill him boldly but not wrathfully
p34680
aVLet\u2019s carve him as a dish fit for the gods
p34681
aVNot hew him as a carcass fit for hounds
p34682
aVAnd let our hearts as subtle masters do
p34683
aVStir up their servants to an act of rage
p34684
aVAnd after seem to chide \u2019em This shall make
p34685
aVOur purpose necessary and not envious
p34686
aVWhich so appearing to the common eyes
p34687
aVWe shall be called purgers not murderers
p34688
aVAnd for Mark Antony think not of him
p34689
aVFor he can do no more than Caesar\u2019s arm
p34690
aVWhen Caesar\u2019s head is off
p34691
aVYet I fear him
p34692
aVFor in the engrafted love he bears to Caesar
p34693
aVAlas good Cassius do not think of him
p34694
aVIf he love Caesar all that he can do
p34695
aVIs to himself take thought and die for Caesar
p34696
aVAnd that were much he should for he is given
p34697
aVTo sports to wildness and much company
p34698
aVThere is no fear in him Let him not die
p34699
aVFor he will live and laugh at this hereafter
p34700
aVPeace count the clock
p34701
aVThe clock hath stricken three
p34702
aV\u2019Tis time to part
p34703
aVBut it is doubtful yet
p34704
aVWhether Caesar will come forth today or no
p34705
aVFor he is superstitious grown of late
p34706
aVQuite from the main opinion he held once
p34707
aVOf fantasy of dreams and ceremonies
p34708
aVIt may be these apparent prodigies
p34709
aVThe unaccustomed terror of this night
p34710
aVAnd the persuasion of his augurers
p34711
aVMay hold him from the Capitol today
p34712
aVNever fear that If he be so resolved
p34713
aVI can o\u2019ersway him for he loves to hear
p34714
aVThat unicorns may be betrayed with trees
p34715
aVAnd bears with glasses elephants with holes
p34716
aVLions with toils and men with flatterers
p34717
aVBut when I tell him he hates flatterers
p34718
aVHe says he does being then most flatterèd
p34719
aVLet me work
p34720
aVFor I can give his humor the true bent
p34721
aVAnd I will bring him to the Capitol
p34722
aVNay we will all of us be there to fetch him
p34723
aVBy the eighth hour is that the uttermost
p34724
aVBe that the uttermost and fail not then
p34725
aVCaius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard
p34726
aVWho rated him for speaking well of Pompey
p34727
aVI wonder none of you have thought of him
p34728
aVNow good Metellus go along by him
p34729
aVHe loves me well and I have given him reasons
p34730
aVSend him but hither and I\u2019ll fashion him
p34731
aVThe morning comes upon \u2019s We\u2019ll leave you Brutus
p34732
aVAnd friends disperse yourselves but all remember
p34733
aVWhat you have said and show yourselves true Romans
p34734
aVGood gentlemen look fresh and merrily
p34735
aVLet not our looks put on our purposes
p34736
aVBut bear it as our Roman actors do
p34737
aVWith untired spirits and formal constancy
p34738
aVAnd so good morrow to you every one
p34739
aVBoy Lucius Fast asleep It is no matter
p34740
aVEnjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber
p34741
aVThou hast no figures nor no fantasies
p34742
aVWhich busy care draws in the brains of men
p34743
aVTherefore thou sleep\u2019st so sound
p34744
aVBrutus my lord
p34745
aVPortia What mean you Wherefore rise you now
p34746
aVIt is not for your health thus to commit
p34747
aVYour weak condition to the raw cold morning
p34748
aVNor for yours neither You\u2019ve ungently Brutus
p34749
aVStole from my bed And yesternight at supper
p34750
aVYou suddenly arose and walked about
p34751
aVMusing and sighing with your arms across
p34752
aVAnd when I asked you what the matter was
p34753
aVYou stared upon me with ungentle looks
p34754
aVI urged you further then you scratched your head
p34755
aVAnd too impatiently stamped with your foot
p34756
aVYet I insisted yet you answered not
p34757
aVBut with an angry wafture of your hand
p34758
aVGave sign for me to leave you So I did
p34759
aVFearing to strengthen that impatience
p34760
aVWhich seemed too much enkindled and withal
p34761
aVHoping it was but an effect of humor
p34762
aVWhich sometime hath his hour with every man
p34763
aVIt will not let you eat nor talk nor sleep
p34764
aVAnd could it work so much upon your shape
p34765
aVAs it hath much prevailed on your condition
p34766
aVI should not know you Brutus Dear my lord
p34767
aVMake me acquainted with your cause of grief
p34768
aVI am not well in health and that is all
p34769
aVBrutus is wise and were he not in health
p34770
aVHe would embrace the means to come by it
p34771
aVWhy so I do Good Portia go to bed
p34772
aVIs Brutus sick And is it physical
p34773
aVTo walk unbracèd and suck up the humors
p34774
aVOf the dank morning What is Brutus sick
p34775
aVAnd will he steal out of his wholesome bed
p34776
aVTo dare the vile contagion of the night
p34777
aVAnd tempt the rheumy and unpurgèd air
p34778
aVTo add unto his sickness No my Brutus
p34779
aVYou have some sick offense within your mind
p34780
aVWhich by the right and virtue of my place
p34781
aVI ought to know of She kneels And upon my knees
p34782
aVI charm you by my once commended beauty
p34783
aVBy all your vows of love and that great vow
p34784
aVWhich did incorporate and make us one
p34785
aVThat you unfold to me your self your half
p34786
aVWhy you are heavy and what men tonight
p34787
aVHave had resort to you for here have been
p34788
aVSome six or seven who did hide their faces
p34789
aVEven from darkness
p34790
aVKneel not gentle Portia
p34791
aVI should not need if you were gentle Brutus
p34792
aVWithin the bond of marriage tell me Brutus
p34793
aVIs it excepted I should know no secrets
p34794
aVThat appertain to you Am I your self
p34795
aVBut as it were in sort or limitation
p34796
aVTo keep with you at meals comfort your bed
p34797
aVAnd talk to you sometimes Dwell I but in the suburbs
p34798
aVOf your good pleasure If it be no more
p34799
aVPortia is Brutus\u2019 harlot not his wife
p34800
aVYou are my true and honorable wife
p34801
aVAs dear to me as are the ruddy drops
p34802
aVThat visit my sad heart
p34803
aVIf this were true then should I know this secret
p34804
aVI grant I am a woman but withal
p34805
aVA woman that Lord Brutus took to wife
p34806
aVI grant I am a woman but withal
p34807
aVA woman well-reputed Cato\u2019s daughter
p34808
aVThink you I am no stronger than my sex
p34809
aVBeing so fathered and so husbanded
p34810

aVHelp ho they murder Caesar Who\u2019s within
p34856
aVGo bid the priests do present sacrifice
p34857
aVAnd bring me their opinions of success
p34858
aVWhat mean you Caesar Think you to walk forth
p34859
aVYou shall not stir out of your house today
p34860
aVCaesar shall forth The things that threatened me
p34861
aVNe\u2019er looked but on my back When they shall see
p34862
aVThe face of Caesar they are vanishèd
p34863
aVCaesar I never stood on ceremonies
p34864
aVYet now they fright me There is one within
p34865
aVBesides the things that we have heard and seen
p34866
aVRecounts most horrid sights seen by the watch
p34867
aVA lioness hath whelpèd in the streets
p34868
aVAnd graves have yawned and yielded up their dead
p34869
aVFierce fiery warriors fought upon the clouds
p34870
aVIn ranks and squadrons and right form of war
p34871
aVWhich drizzled blood upon the Capitol
p34872
aVThe noise of battle hurtled in the air
p34873
aVHorses did neigh and dying men did groan
p34874
aVAnd ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets
p34875
aVO Caesar these things are beyond all use
p34876
aVAnd I do fear them
p34877
aVWhat can be avoided
p34878
aVWhose end is purposed by the mighty gods
p34879
aVYet Caesar shall go forth for these predictions
p34880
aVAre to the world in general as to Caesar
p34881
aVWhen beggars die there are no comets seen

aVThe heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes
p34883
aVCowards die many times before their deaths
p34884
aVThe valiant never taste of death but once
p34885
aVOf all the wonders that I yet have heard
p34886
aVIt seems to me most strange that men should fear
p34887
aVSeeing that death a necessary end
p34888
aVWill come when it will come
p34889
aVWhat say the augurers
p34890
aVThey would not have you to stir forth today
p34891
aVPlucking the entrails of an offering forth
p34892
aVThey could not find a heart within the beast
p34893
aVThe gods do this in shame of cowardice
p34894
aVCaesar should be a beast without a heart
p34895
aVIf he should stay at home today for fear
p34896
aVNo Caesar shall not Danger knows full well
p34897
aVThat Caesar is more dangerous than he
p34898
aVWe are two lions littered in one day
p34899
aVAnd I the elder and more terrible
p34900
aVAnd Caesar shall go forth
p34901
aVAlas my lord
p34902
aVYour wisdom is consumed in confidence
p34903
aVDo not go forth today Call it my fear
p34904
aVThat keeps you in the house and not your own
p34905
aVWe\u2019ll send Mark Antony to the Senate House
p34906
aVAnd he shall say you are not well today
p34907
aVLet me upon my knee prevail in this
p34908
aVMark Antony shall say I am not well
p34909
aVAnd for thy humor I will stay at home
p34910
aVHere\u2019s Decius Brutus he shall tell them so

aVI will not come today Tell them so Decius
p34918
aVSay he is sick
p34919
aVShall Caesar send a lie
p34920
aVHave I in conquest stretched mine arm so far
p34921
aVTo be afeard to tell graybeards the truth
p34922
aVDecius go tell them Caesar will not come
p34923
aVMost mighty Caesar let me know some cause
p34924
aVLest I be laughed at when I tell them so
p34925
aVThe cause is in my will I will not come
p34926
aVThat is enough to satisfy the Senate
p34927
aVBut for your private satisfaction
p34928
aVBecause I love you I will let you know
p34929
aVCalphurnia here my wife stays me at home
p34930
aVShe dreamt tonight she saw my statue
p34931
aVWhich like a fountain with an hundred spouts
p34932
aVDid run pure blood and many lusty Romans
p34933
aVCame smiling and did bathe their hands in it
p34934
aVAnd these does she apply for warnings and portents
p34935
aVAnd evils imminent and on her knee
p34936
aVHath begged that I will stay at home today
p34937
aVThis dream is all amiss interpreted
p34938
aVIt was a vision fair and fortunate
p34939
aVYour statue spouting blood in many pipes
p34940
aVIn which so many smiling Romans bathed
p34941
aVSignifies that from you great Rome shall suck
p34942
aVReviving blood and that great men shall press
p34943
aVFor tinctures stains relics and cognizance
p34944
aVThis by Calphurnia\u2019s dream is signified
p34945
aVAnd this way have you well expounded it
p34946
aVI have when you have heard what I can say
p34947
aVAnd know it now the Senate have concluded
p34948
aVTo give this day a crown to mighty Caesar
p34949
aVIf you shall send them word you will not come
p34950
aVTheir minds may change Besides it were a mock
p34951
aVApt to be rendered for someone to say
p34952
aVBreak up the Senate till another time
p34953
aVWhen Caesar\u2019s wife shall meet with better dreams
p34954
aVIf Caesar hide himself shall they not whisper
p34955
aVLo Caesar is afraid
p34956
aVPardon me Caesar for my dear dear love
p34957
aVTo your proceeding bids me tell you this
p34958
aVAnd reason to my love is liable

aVI must prevent thee Cimber
p35075
aVThese couchings and these lowly courtesies
p35076
aVMight fire the blood of ordinary men
p35077
aVAnd turn preordinance and first decree
p35078
aVInto the law of children Be not fond
p35079
aVTo think that Caesar bears such rebel blood
p35080
aVThat will be thawed from the true quality
p35081
aVWith that which melteth fools I mean sweet words
p35082
aVLow-crookèd curtsies and base spaniel fawning
p35083
aVThy brother by decree is banishèd
p35084
aVIf thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him
p35085
aVI spurn thee like a cur out of my way
p35086

aVWill he be satisfied

aVIs there no voice more worthy than my own

aVTo sound more sweetly in great Caesar\u2019s ear
p35090
aVFor the repealing of my banished brother
p35091
aVI kiss thy hand but not in flattery Caesar

aVWhat Brutus

aVPardon Caesar Caesar pardon
p35096
aVAs low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall
p35097
aVTo beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber
p35098
aVI could be well moved if I were as you
p35099
aVIf I could pray to move prayers would move me
p35100
aVBut I am constant as the Northern Star
p35101
aVOf whose true fixed and resting quality
p35102
aVThere is no fellow in the firmament
p35103
aVThe skies are painted with unnumbered sparks
p35104
aVThey are all fire and every one doth shine
p35105
aVBut there\u2019s but one in all doth hold his place
p35106
aVSo in the world \u2019tis furnished well with men
p35107
aVAnd men are flesh and blood and apprehensive
p35108
aVYet in the number I do know but one
p35109
aVThat unassailable holds on his rank
p35110
aVUnshaked of motion and that I am he
p35111
aVLet me a little show it even in this

aVThat I was constant Cimber should be banished

aVThere is no harm intended to your person

p35144
aVThat we shall die we know \u2019tis but the time
p35145
aVAnd drawing days out that men stand upon

aVWhy he that cuts off twenty years of life
p35147
aVCuts off so many years of fearing death
p35148
aVGrant that and then is death a benefit
p35149
aVSo are we Caesar\u2019s friends that have abridged
p35150
aVHis time of fearing death Stoop Romans stoop
p35151
aVAnd let us bathe our hands in Caesar\u2019s blood
p35152
aVUp to the elbows and besmear our swords
p35153
aVThen walk we forth even to the marketplace
p35154
aVAnd waving our red weapons o\u2019er our heads
p35155
aVLet\u2019s all cry Peace freedom and liberty
p35156
aVStoop then and wash
p35157
aVHow many ages hence
p35158
aVShall this our lofty scene be acted over
p35159
aVIn states unborn and accents yet unknown
p35160
aVHow many times shall Caesar bleed in sport
p35161
aVThat now on Pompey\u2019s basis lies along
p35162
aVNo worthier than the dust
p35163
aVSo oft as that shall be

aVSoft who comes here A friend of Antony\u2019s
p35171
aVThus Brutus did my master bid me kneel
p35172
aVThus did Mark Antony bid me fall down
p35173
aVAnd being prostrate thus he bade me say
p35174
aVBrutus is noble wise valiant and honest
p35175
aVCaesar was mighty bold royal and loving
p35176
aVSay I love Brutus and I honor him
p35177
aVSay I feared Caesar honored him and loved him
p35178
aVIf Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony
p35179
aVMay safely come to him and be resolved
p35180
aVHow Caesar hath deserved to lie in death
p35181
aVMark Antony shall not love Caesar dead
p35182
aVSo well as Brutus living but will follow
p35183
aVThe fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus
p35184
aVThorough the hazards of this untrod state

aVI never thought him worse

aVDepart untouched
p35191
aVI\u2019ll fetch him presently
p35192
aVI know that we shall have him well to friend
p35193
aVI wish we may but yet have I a mind
p35194
aVThat fears him much and my misgiving still
p35195
aVFalls shrewdly to the purpose
p35196
aVBut here comes Antony Welcome Mark Antony
p35197
aVO mighty Caesar dost thou lie so low
p35198
aVAre all thy conquests glories triumphs spoils
p35199

aVTo young Octavius of the state of things
p35352
aVLend me your hand

aVBy our permission is allowed to make
p35379
aVI do entreat you not a man depart
p35380
aVSave I alone till Antony have spoke
p35381
aVStay ho and let us hear Mark Antony
p35382
aVLet him go up into the public chair
p35383
aVWe\u2019ll hear him Noble Antony go up

aVWhat does he say of Brutus
p35386
aVHe says for Brutus\u2019 sake
p35387
aVHe finds himself beholding to us all
p35388
aV\u2019Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here
p35389
aVThis Caesar was a tyrant
p35390
aVNay that\u2019s certain
p35391
aVWe are blest that Rome is rid of him
p35392
aVPeace let us hear what Antony can say
p35393
aVYou gentle Romans
p35394
aVPeace ho Let us hear him
p35395
aVFriends Romans countrymen lend me your ears
p35396
aVI come to bury Caesar not to praise him
p35397
aVThe evil that men do lives after them
p35398
aVThe good is oft interrèd with their bones
p35399
aVSo let it be with Caesar The noble Brutus
p35400
aVHath told you Caesar was ambitious
p35401
aVIf it were so it was a grievous fault
p35402
aVAnd grievously hath Caesar answered it
p35403
aVHere under leave of Brutus and the rest
p35404
aVFor Brutus is an honorable man
p35405
aVSo are they all all honorable men
p35406
aVCome I to speak in Caesar\u2019s funeral
p35407
aVHe was my friend faithful and just to me
p35408
aVBut Brutus says he was ambitious
p35409
aVAnd Brutus is an honorable man
p35410
aVHe hath brought many captives home to Rome
p35411
aVWhose ransoms did the general coffers fill
p35412
aVDid this in Caesar seem ambitious
p35413
aVWhen that the poor have cried Caesar hath wept
p35414
aVAmbition should be made of sterner stuff
p35415
aVYet Brutus says he was ambitious
p35416
aVAnd Brutus is an honorable man
p35417
aVYou all did see that on the Lupercal
p35418
aVI thrice presented him a kingly crown
p35419
aVWhich he did thrice refuse Was this ambition
p35420
aVYet Brutus says he was ambitious
p35421
aVAnd sure he is an honorable man
p35422
aVI speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke
p35423
aVBut here I am to speak what I do know
p35424
aVYou all did love him once not without cause
p35425
aVWhat cause withholds you then to mourn for him
p35426
aVO judgment thou art fled to brutish beasts
p35427
aVAnd men have lost their reason Bear with me
p35428
aVMy heart is in the coffin there with Caesar
p35429
aVAnd I must pause till it come back to me
p35430
aVMethinks there is much reason in his sayings
p35431
aVIf thou consider rightly of the matter
p35432
aVCaesar has had great wrong
p35433
aVHas he masters
p35434
aVI fear there will a worse come in his place
p35435
aVMarked you his words He would not take the crown
p35436
aVTherefore \u2019tis certain he was not ambitious
p35437
aVIf it be found so some will dear abide it
p35438
aVPoor soul his eyes are red as fire with weeping
p35439
aVThere\u2019s not a nobler man in Rome than Antony
p35440
aVNow mark him He begins again to speak
p35441
aVBut yesterday the word of Caesar might
p35442
aVHave stood against the world Now lies he there
p35443
aVAnd none so poor to do him reverence
p35444
aVO masters if I were disposed to stir
p35445
aVYour hearts and minds to mutiny and rage
p35446
aVI should do Brutus wrong and Cassius wrong
p35447
aVWho you all know are honorable men
p35448
aVI will not do them wrong I rather choose
p35449
aVTo wrong the dead to wrong myself and you
p35450
aVThan I will wrong such honorable men
p35451
aVBut here\u2019s a parchment with the seal of Caesar
p35452
aVI found it in his closet \u2019Tis his will
p35453
aVLet but the commons hear this testament
p35454
aVWhich pardon me I do not mean to read
p35455
aVAnd they would go and kiss dead Caesar\u2019s wounds
p35456
aVAnd dip their napkins in his sacred blood
p35457
aVYea beg a hair of him for memory
p35458
aVAnd dying mention it within their wills
p35459
aVBequeathing it as a rich legacy
p35460
aVUnto their issue
p35461
aVWe\u2019ll hear the will Read it Mark Antony
p35462
aVThe will the will We will hear Caesar\u2019s will
p35463
aVHave patience gentle friends I must not read it
p35464
aVIt is not meet you know how Caesar loved you
p35465
aVYou are not wood you are not stones but men
p35466
aVAnd being men hearing the will of Caesar
p35467
aVIt will inflame you it will make you mad
p35468
aV\u2019Tis good you know not that you are his heirs
p35469
aVFor if you should O what would come of it
p35470
aVRead the will We\u2019ll hear it Antony
p35471
aVYou shall read us the will Caesar\u2019s will
p35472
aVWill you be patient Will you stay awhile
p35473
aVI have o\u2019ershot myself to tell you of it
p35474
aVI fear I wrong the honorable men
p35475
aVWhose daggers have stabbed Caesar I do fear it
p35476
aVYou will compel me then to read the will
p35477
aVThen make a ring about the corpse of Caesar
p35478
aVAnd let me show you him that made the will
p35479
aVShall I descend And will you give me leave
p35480
aVCome down
p35481
aVDescend
p35482
aVYou shall have leave
p35483
aVA ring stand round
p35484
aVStand from the hearse Stand from the body
p35485
aVRoom for Antony most noble Antony
p35486
aVNay press not so upon me Stand far off
p35487
aVIf you have tears prepare to shed them now
p35488
aVYou all do know this mantle I remember
p35489
aVThe first time ever Caesar put it on
p35490
aV\u2019Twas on a summer\u2019s evening in his tent
p35491
aVThat day he overcame the Nervii
p35492
aVLook in this place ran Cassius\u2019 dagger through
p35493
aVSee what a rent the envious Casca made
p35494
aVThrough this the well-belovèd Brutus stabbed
p35495
aVAnd as he plucked his cursèd steel away
p35496
aVMark how the blood of Caesar followed it
p35497
aVAs rushing out of doors to be resolved
p35498
aVIf Brutus so unkindly knocked or no
p35499
aVFor Brutus as you know was Caesar\u2019s angel
p35500
aVJudge O you gods how dearly Caesar loved him
p35501
aVThis was the most unkindest cut of all
p35502
aVFor when the noble Caesar saw him stab
p35503
aVIngratitude more strong than traitors\u2019 arms
p35504
aVQuite vanquished him Then burst his mighty heart
p35505
aVAnd in his mantle muffling up his face
p35506
aVEven at the base of Pompey\u2019s statue
p35507
aVWhich all the while ran blood great Caesar fell
p35508
aVO what a fall was there my countrymen
p35509
aVThen I and you and all of us fell down
p35510
aVWhilst bloody treason flourished over us
p35511
aVO now you weep and I perceive you feel
p35512
aVThe dint of pity These are gracious drops
p35513
aVKind souls what weep you when you but behold
p35514
aVOur Caesar\u2019s vesture wounded Look you here
p35515
aVHere is himself marred as you see with traitors
p35516
aVGood friends sweet friends let me not stir you up
p35517
aVTo such a sudden flood of mutiny
p35518
aVThey that have done this deed are honorable
p35519
aVWhat private griefs they have alas I know not
p35520
aVThat made them do it They are wise and honorable
p35521
aVAnd will no doubt with reasons answer you
p35522
aVI come not friends to steal away your hearts
p35523
aVI am no orator as Brutus is
p35524
aVBut as you know me all a plain blunt man
p35525
aVThat love my friend and that they know full well
p35526
aVThat gave me public leave to speak of him
p35527
aVFor I have neither wit nor words nor worth
p35528
aVAction nor utterance nor the power of speech
p35529
aVTo stir men\u2019s blood I only speak right on
p35530
aVI tell you that which you yourselves do know
p35531
aVShow you sweet Caesar\u2019s wounds poor poor dumb mouths
p35532
aVAnd bid them speak for me But were I Brutus
p35533
aVAnd Brutus Antony there were an Antony
p35534
aVWould ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue
p35535
aVIn every wound of Caesar that should move
p35536
aVThe stones of Rome to rise and mutiny
p35537
aVWe\u2019ll mutiny
p35538
aVWe\u2019ll burn the house of Brutus
p35539
aVAway then Come seek the conspirators
p35540
aVYet hear me countrymen yet hear me speak
p35541
aVPeace ho Hear Antony most noble Antony
p35542
aVWhy friends you go to do you know not what
p35543
aVWherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves
p35544
aVAlas you know not I must tell you then
p35545
aVYou have forgot the will I told you of
p35546
aVMost true The will Let\u2019s stay and hear the will
p35547
aVHere is the will and under Caesar\u2019s seal
p35548
aVTo every Roman citizen he gives

p35551
aVO royal Caesar

aVMoreover he hath left you all his walks
p35555

aVOn this side Tiber He hath left them you

aVHere was a Caesar When comes such another
p35560

aVHow now fellow
p35570
aVSir Octavius is already come to Rome
p35571
aVHe and Lepidus are at Caesar\u2019s house
p35572
aVAnd thither will I straight to visit him
p35573
aVHe comes upon a wish Fortune is merry
p35574
aVAnd in this mood will give us anything
p35575
aVI heard him say Brutus and Cassius
p35576
aVAre rid like madmen through the gates of Rome
p35577
aVBelike they had some notice of the people
p35578
aVHow I had moved them Bring me to Octavius
p35579
aVI dreamt tonight that I did feast with Caesar
p35580
aVAnd things unluckily charge my fantasy
p35581
aVI have no will to wander forth of doors
p35582
aVYet something leads me forth
p35583
aVThese many then shall die their names are pricked
p35584
aVYour brother too must die Consent you Lepidus

aVWhat shall I find you here
p35594
aVOr here or at the Capitol
p35595
aVThis is a slight unmeritable man
p35596
aVMeet to be sent on errands Is it fit
p35597
aVThe threefold world divided he should stand
p35598
aVOne of the three to share it
p35599
aVSo you thought him
p35600
aVAnd took his voice who should be pricked to die
p35601
aVIn our black sentence and proscription
p35602
aVOctavius I have seen more days than you
p35603
aVAnd though we lay these honors on this man
p35604
aVTo ease ourselves of diverse sland\u2019rous loads
p35605
aVHe shall but bear them as the ass bears gold
p35606
aVTo groan and sweat under the business
p35607
aVEither led or driven as we point the way
p35608
aVAnd having brought our treasure where we will
p35609
aVThen take we down his load and turn him off

aVLike to the empty ass to shake his ears
p35611
aVAnd graze in commons
p35612
aVYou may do your will
p35613
aVBut he\u2019s a tried and valiant soldier
p35614
aVSo is my horse Octavius and for that
p35615
aVI do appoint him store of provender
p35616
aVIt is a creature that I teach to fight
p35617
aVTo wind to stop to run directly on
p35618
aVHis corporal motion governed by my spirit
p35619
aVAnd in some taste is Lepidus but so
p35620
aVHe must be taught and trained and bid go forth
p35621
aVA barren-spirited fellow one that feeds
p35622
aVOn objects arts and imitations
p35623
aVWhich out of use and staled by other men
p35624
aVBegin his fashion Do not talk of him
p35625
aVBut as a property And now Octavius
p35626
aVListen great things Brutus and Cassius
p35627
aVAre levying powers We must straight make head
p35628
aVTherefore let our alliance be combined
p35629
aVOur best friends made our means stretched
p35630
aVAnd let us presently go sit in council
p35631
aVHow covert matters may be best disclosed
p35632
aVAnd open perils surest answerèd
p35633
aVLet us do so for we are at the stake
p35634
aVAnd bayed about with many enemies
p35635
aVAnd some that smile have in their hearts I fear
p35636
aVMillions of mischiefs
p35637
aVWhat now Lucilius is Cassius near
p35638
aVHe is at hand and Pindarus is come
p35639
aVTo do you salutation from his master
p35640
aVHe greets me well Your master Pindarus
p35641
aVIn his own change or by ill officers
p35642
aVHath given me some worthy cause to wish
p35643
aVThings done undone but if he be at hand
p35644
aVI shall be satisfied
p35645
aVI do not doubt
p35646
aVBut that my noble master will appear
p35647
aVSuch as he is full of regard and honor
p35648
aVHe is not doubted
p35649
aVA word Lucilius
p35650
aVHow he received you Let me be resolved
p35651
aVWith courtesy and with respect enough
p35652
aVBut not with such familiar instances
p35653
aVNor with such free and friendly conference
p35654
aVAs he hath used of old
p35655
aVThou hast described
p35656
aVA hot friend cooling Ever note Lucilius
p35657
aVWhen love begins to sicken and decay
p35658
aVIt useth an enforcèd ceremony
p35659
aVThere are no tricks in plain and simple faith
p35660
aVBut hollow men like horses hot at hand
p35661
aVMake gallant show and promise of their mettle
p35662
aVBut when they should endure the bloody spur
p35663
aVThey fall their crests and like deceitful jades
p35664
aVSink in the trial Comes his army on
p35665
aVThey mean this night in Sardis to be quartered
p35666
aVThe greater part the horse in general
p35667
aVAre come with Cassius

aVMarch gently on to meet him
p35670
aVMost noble brother you have done me wrong
p35671
aVJudge me you gods Wrong I mine enemies
p35672
aVAnd if not so how should I wrong a brother
p35673
aVBrutus this sober form of yours hides wrongs
p35674
aVAnd when you do them
p35675
aVCassius be content
p35676
aVSpeak your griefs softly I do know you well
p35677
aVBefore the eyes of both our armies here
p35678
aVWhich should perceive nothing but love from us
p35679
aVLet us not wrangle Bid them move away
p35680
aVThen in my tent Cassius enlarge your griefs
p35681
aVAnd I will give you audience
p35682
aVPindarus
p35683
aVBid our commanders lead their charges off
p35684
aVA little from this ground
p35685
aVLucius do you the like and let no man
p35686
aVCome to our tent till we have done our conference
p35687
aVLet Lucilius and Titinius guard our door
p35688
aVThat you have wronged me doth appear in this
p35689
aVYou have condemned and noted Lucius Pella
p35690
aVFor taking bribes here of the Sardians
p35691
aVWherein my letters praying on his side
p35692
aVBecause I knew the man was slighted off
p35693
aVYou wronged yourself to write in such a case
p35694
aVIn such a time as this it is not meet
p35695
aVThat every nice offense should bear his comment
p35696
aVLet me tell you Cassius you yourself
p35697
aVAre much condemned to have an itching palm
p35698
aVTo sell and mart your offices for gold
p35699
aVTo undeservers
p35700
aVI an itching palm
p35701
aVYou know that you are Brutus that speaks this
p35702
aVOr by the gods this speech were else your last
p35703
aVThe name of Cassius honors this corruption
p35704
aVAnd chastisement doth therefore hide his head
p35705
aVRemember March the ides of March remember
p35706
aVDid not great Julius bleed for justice\u2019 sake
p35707
aVWhat villain touched his body that did stab
p35708
aVAnd not for justice What shall one of us
p35709
aVThat struck the foremost man of all this world
p35710
aVBut for supporting robbers shall we now
p35711
aVContaminate our fingers with base bribes
p35712
aVAnd sell the mighty space of our large honors
p35713
aVFor so much trash as may be graspèd thus
p35714
aVI had rather be a dog and bay the moon
p35715
aVThan such a Roman

aVAll this Ay more Fret till your proud heart break

aVGo show your slaves how choleric you are
p35731
aVAnd make your bondmen tremble Must I budge
p35732
aVMust I observe you Must I stand and crouch
p35733
aVUnder your testy humor By the gods
p35734
aVYou shall digest the venom of your spleen
p35735
aVThough it do split you For from this day forth
p35736
aVI\u2019ll use you for my mirth yea for my laughter
p35737
aVWhen you are waspish
p35738
aVIs it come to this
p35739
aVYou say you are a better soldier

aVLet it appear so make your vaunting true
p35741
aVAnd it shall please me well For mine own part
p35742
aVI shall be glad to learn of noble men
p35743
aVYou wrong me every way you wrong me Brutus
p35744
aVI said an elder soldier not a better
p35745
aVDid I say better
p35746
aVIf you did I care not

aVFor your life you durst not

aVI may do that I shall be sorry for
p35753
aVYou have done that you should be sorry for
p35754
aVThere is no terror Cassius in your threats
p35755
aVFor I am armed so strong in honesty
p35756
aVThat they pass by me as the idle wind
p35757
aVWhich I respect not I did send to you
p35758
aVFor certain sums of gold which you denied me
p35759
aVFor I can raise no money by vile means
p35760
aVBy heaven I had rather coin my heart
p35761
aVAnd drop my blood for drachmas than to wring
p35762
aVFrom the hard hands of peasants their vile trash
p35763
aVBy any indirection I did send
p35764
aVTo you for gold to pay my legions
p35765
aVWhich you denied me Was that done like Cassius
p35766
aVShould I have answered Caius Cassius so
p35767
aVWhen Marcus Brutus grows so covetous
p35768
aVTo lock such rascal counters from his friends
p35769
aVBe ready gods with all your thunderbolts
p35770
aVDash him to pieces
p35771
aVI denied you not
p35772
aVYou did
p35773
aVI did not He was but a fool that brought
p35774
aVMy answer back Brutus hath rived my heart
p35775
aVA friend should bear his friend\u2019s infirmities
p35776
aVBut Brutus makes mine greater than they are
p35777
aVI do not till you practice them on me
p35778
aVYou love me not
p35779
aVI do not like your faults
p35780
aVA friendly eye could never see such faults
p35781
aVA flatterer\u2019s would not though they do appear
p35782
aVAs huge as high Olympus
p35783
aVCome Antony and young Octavius come
p35784
aVRevenge yourselves alone on Cassius
p35785
aVFor Cassius is aweary of the world
p35786
aVHated by one he loves braved by his brother
p35787
aVChecked like a bondman all his faults observed
p35788
aVSet in a notebook learned and conned by rote
p35789
aVTo cast into my teeth O I could weep
p35790
aVMy spirit from mine eyes There is my dagger
p35791
aVAnd here my naked breast within a heart

aVIf that thou be\u2019st a Roman take it forth
p35794
aVI that denied thee gold will give my heart
p35795

p35796
aVWhen thou didst hate him worst thou lovedst him better
p35797
aVThan ever thou lovedst Cassius
p35798
aVSheathe your dagger
p35799
aVBe angry when you will it shall have scope
p35800
aVDo what you will dishonor shall be humor
p35801
aVO Cassius you are yokèd with a lamb
p35802
aVThat carries anger as the flint bears fire
p35803
aVWho much enforcèd shows a hasty spark
p35804
aVAnd straight is cold again
p35805
aVHath Cassius lived
p35806
aVTo be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus
p35807
aVWhen grief and blood ill-tempered vexeth him
p35808
aVWhen I spoke that I was ill-tempered too
p35809
aVDo you confess so much Give me your hand
p35810
aVAnd my heart too
p35811
aVO Brutus
p35812
aVWhat\u2019s the matter

aVWhen that rash humor which my mother gave me
p35815
aVMakes me forgetful
p35816
aVYes Cassius and from henceforth
p35817
aVWhen you are over-earnest with your Brutus
p35818
aVHe\u2019ll think your mother chides and leave you so

aVLet me go in to see the Generals
p35820
aVThere is some grudge between \u2019em \u2019tis not meet

aVYou shall not come to them
p35823
aVFor shame you generals what do you mean
p35824
aVLove and be friends as two such men should be

aVGet you hence sirrah Saucy fellow hence
p35828
aVBear with him Brutus \u2019Tis his fashion

aVI did not think you could have been so angry
p35839
aVO Cassius I am sick of many griefs
p35840
aVOf your philosophy you make no use
p35841
aVIf you give place to accidental evils

p35843
aVHow \u2019scaped I killing when I crossed you so
p35844

aVI do not think it good
p35896
aVYour reason
p35897
aVThis it is
p35898
aV\u2019Tis better that the enemy seek us
p35899
aVSo shall he waste his means weary his soldiers
p35900
aVDoing himself offense whilst we lying still
p35901
aVAre full of rest defense and nimbleness
p35902
aVGood reasons must of force give place to better
p35903
aVThe people \u2019twixt Philippi and this ground
p35904
aVDo stand but in a forced affection
p35905
aVFor they have grudged us contribution
p35906
aVThe enemy marching along by them
p35907
aVBy them shall make a fuller number up
p35908
aVCome on refreshed new-added and encouraged

aVIs bound in shallows and in miseries
p35922

p36022
aVTut I am in their bosoms and I know
p36023
aVWherefore they do it They could be content
p36024
aVTo visit other places and come down
p36025
aVWith fearful bravery thinking by this face
p36026
aVTo fasten in our thoughts that they have courage
p36027
aVBut \u2019tis not so
p36028
aVPrepare you generals
p36029
aVThe enemy comes on in gallant show
p36030
aVTheir bloody sign of battle is hung out
p36031
aVAnd something to be done immediately
p36032
aVOctavius lead your battle softly on
p36033
aVUpon the left hand of the even field
p36034
aVUpon the right hand I keep thou the left
p36035
aVWhy do you cross me in this exigent
p36036
aVI do not cross you but I will do so
p36037
aVStand fast Titinius We must out and talk
p36038
aVMark Antony shall we give sign of battle
p36039
aVNo Caesar we will answer on their charge
p36040
aVMake forth The Generals would have some words
p36041
aVWords before blows is it so countrymen
p36042
aVNot that we love words better as you do
p36043
aVGood words are better than bad strokes Octavius
p36044
aVIn your bad strokes Brutus you give good words
p36045
aVWitness the hole you made in Caesar\u2019s heart
p36046
aVCrying Long live hail Caesar
p36047
aVAntony
p36048
aVThe posture of your blows are yet unknown
p36049
aVBut for your words they rob the Hybla bees
p36050
aVAnd leave them honeyless
p36051
aVNot stingless too
p36052
aVO yes and soundless too
p36053
aVFor you have stolen their buzzing Antony
p36054
aVAnd very wisely threat before you sting
p36055
aVVillains you did not so when your vile daggers
p36056
aVHacked one another in the sides of Caesar
p36057
aVYou showed your teeth like apes and fawned like hounds
p36058
aVAnd bowed like bondmen kissing Caesar\u2019s feet
p36059
aVWhilst damnèd Casca like a cur behind
p36060
aVStruck Caesar on the neck O you flatterers
p36061
aVFlatterers Now Brutus thank yourself
p36062
aVThis tongue had not offended so today
p36063
aVIf Cassius might have ruled
p36064
aVCome come the cause If arguing make us sweat
p36065
aVThe proof of it will turn to redder drops
p36066
aVLook I draw a sword against conspirators
p36067
aVWhen think you that the sword goes up again
p36068
aVNever till Caesar\u2019s three and thirty wounds
p36069
aVBe well avenged or till another Caesar
p36070
aVHave added slaughter to the sword of traitors
p36071
aVCaesar thou canst not die by traitors\u2019 hands
p36072
aVUnless thou bring\u2019st them with thee
p36073
aVSo I hope
p36074
aVI was not born to die on Brutus\u2019 sword
p36075
aVO if thou wert the noblest of thy strain
p36076
aVYoung man thou couldst not die more honorable
p36077
aVA peevish schoolboy worthless of such honor
p36078
aVJoined with a masker and a reveler
p36079
aVOld Cassius still
p36080
aVCome Antony away
p36081
aVDefiance traitors hurl we in your teeth
p36082
aVIf you dare fight today come to the field
p36083
aVIf not when you have stomachs
p36084
aVWhy now blow wind swell billow and swim bark
p36085
aVThe storm is up and all is on the hazard
p36086
aVHo Lucilius hark a word with you
p36087
aVMessala
p36088
aVWhat says my general
p36089
aVMessala
p36090
aVThis is my birthday as this very day
p36091
aVWas Cassius born Give me thy hand Messala
p36092
aVBe thou my witness that against my will
p36093
aVAs Pompey was am I compelled to set
p36094
aVUpon one battle all our liberties
p36095
aVYou know that I held Epicurus strong
p36096
aVAnd his opinion Now I change my mind
p36097
aVAnd partly credit things that do presage
p36098
aVComing from Sardis on our former ensign
p36099
aVTwo mighty eagles fell and there they perched
p36100
aVGorging and feeding from our soldiers\u2019 hands
p36101
aVWho to Philippi here consorted us
p36102
aVThis morning are they fled away and gone
p36103
aVAnd in their steads do ravens crows and kites
p36104
aVFly o\u2019er our heads and downward look on us
p36105
aVAs we were sickly prey Their shadows seem
p36106
aVA canopy most fatal under which
p36107
aVOur army lies ready to give up the ghost
p36108
aVBelieve not so
p36109
aVI but believe it partly
p36110
aVFor I am fresh of spirit and resolved
p36111
aVTo meet all perils very constantly
p36112
aVEven so Lucilius
p36113
aVNow most noble Brutus
p36114
aVThe gods today stand friendly that we may
p36115
aVLovers in peace lead on our days to age
p36116
aVBut since the affairs of men rests still incertain
p36117
aVLet\u2019s reason with the worst that may befall
p36118
aVIf we do lose this battle then is this
p36119
aVThe very last time we shall speak together
p36120
aVWhat are you then determinèd to do
p36121
aVEven by the rule of that philosophy
p36122
aVBy which I did blame Cato for the death
p36123
aVWhich he did give himself I know not how
p36124
aVBut I do find it cowardly and vile
p36125
aVFor fear of what might fall so to prevent
p36126
aVThe time of life arming myself with patience
p36127
aVTo stay the providence of some high powers
p36128
aVThat govern us below
p36129
aVThen if we lose this battle
p36130
aVYou are contented to be led in triumph
p36131
aVThorough the streets of Rome
p36132
aVNo Cassius no Think not thou noble Roman
p36133
aVThat ever Brutus will go bound to Rome
p36134
aVHe bears too great a mind But this same day
p36135
aVMust end that work the ides of March begun
p36136
aVAnd whether we shall meet again I know not
p36137
aVTherefore our everlasting farewell take
p36138
aVForever and forever farewell Cassius
p36139
aVIf we do meet again why we shall smile
p36140
aVIf not why then this parting was well made
p36141
aVForever and forever farewell Brutus
p36142
aVIf we do meet again we\u2019ll smile indeed
p36143
aVIf not \u2019tis true this parting was well made
p36144
aVWhy then lead on O that a man might know
p36145
aVThe end of this day\u2019s business ere it come
p36146
aVBut it sufficeth that the day will end
p36147
aVAnd then the end is known Come ho away
p36148
aVRide ride Messala ride and give these bills
p36149
aVUnto the legions on the other side
p36150
aVLet them set on at once for I perceive
p36151
aVBut cold demeanor in Octavius\u2019 wing
p36152
aVAnd sudden push gives them the overthrow
p36153
aVRide ride Messala Let them all come down
p36154
aVO look Titinius look the villains fly
p36155
aVMyself have to mine own turned enemy
p36156
aVThis ensign here of mine was turning back
p36157
aVI slew the coward and did take it from him
p36158
aVO Cassius Brutus gave the word too early
p36159
aVWho having some advantage on Octavius
p36160
aVTook it too eagerly His soldiers fell to spoil
p36161
aVWhilst we by Antony are all enclosed
p36162
aVFly further off my lord fly further off

p36379
aVHis life was gentle and the elements
p36380
aVSo mixed in him that nature might stand up

aVHow that ambitious Constance would not cease
p36420
aVTill she had kindled France and all the world
p36421
aVUpon the right and party of her son
p36422
aVThis might have been prevented and made whole
p36423
aVWith very easy arguments of love

aVWhich now the manage of two kingdoms must

aVWith fearful bloody issue arbitrate
p36426
aVOur strong possession and our right for us
p36427
aVYour strong possession much more than your right
p36428
aVOr else it must go wrong with you and me
p36429
aVSo much my conscience whispers in your ear
p36430
aVWhich none but God and you and I shall hear

aVMy liege here is the strangest controversy

p36442
aVOf Coeur de Lion knighted in the field
p36443
aVWhat art thou
p36444
aVThe son and heir to that same Faulconbridge
p36445
aVIs that the elder and art thou the heir
p36446
aVYou came not of one mother then it seems
p36447
aVMost certain of one mother mighty king
p36448
aVThat is well known and as I think one father
p36449
aVBut for the certain knowledge of that truth
p36450
aVI put you o\u2019er to heaven and to my mother
p36451
aVOf that I doubt as all men\u2019s children may
p36452
aVOut on thee rude man Thou dost shame thy mother
p36453
aVAnd wound her honor with this diffidence
p36454
aVI madam No I have no reason for it
p36455
aVThat is my brother\u2019s plea and none of mine
p36456
aVThe which if he can prove he pops me out
p36457
aVAt least from fair five hundred pound a year
p36458
aVHeaven guard my mother\u2019s honor and my land
p36459
aVA good blunt fellow Why being younger born
p36460
aVDoth he lay claim to thine inheritance
p36461
aVI know not why except to get the land
p36462
aVBut once he slandered me with bastardy
p36463
aVBut whe\u2019er I be as true begot or no
p36464
aVThat still I lay upon my mother\u2019s head
p36465
aVBut that I am as well begot my liege
p36466
aVFair fall the bones that took the pains for me
p36467
aVCompare our faces and be judge yourself
p36468
aVIf old Sir Robert did beget us both
p36469
aVAnd were our father and this son like him
p36470
aVO old Sir Robert father on my knee
p36471
aVI give heaven thanks I was not like to thee
p36472
aVWhy what a madcap hath heaven lent us here
p36473
aVHe hath a trick of Coeur de Lion\u2019s face
p36474
aVThe accent of his tongue affecteth him
p36475
aVDo you not read some tokens of my son
p36476
aVIn the large composition of this man
p36477
aVMine eye hath well examinèd his parts
p36478
aVAnd finds them perfect Richard
p36479
aVSirrah speak
p36480
aVWhat doth move you to claim your brother\u2019s land
p36481
aVBecause he hath a half-face like my father
p36482
aVWith half that face would he have all my land
p36483
aVA half-faced groat five hundred pound a year
p36484
aVMy gracious liege when that my father lived
p36485
aVYour brother did employ my father much
p36486
aVWell sir by this you cannot get my land
p36487
aVYour tale must be how he employed my mother
p36488
aVAnd once dispatched him in an embassy
p36489
aVTo Germany there with the Emperor
p36490
aVTo treat of high affairs touching that time
p36491
aVTh\u2019 advantage of his absence took the King
p36492
aVAnd in the meantime sojourned at my father\u2019s
p36493
aVWhere how he did prevail I shame to speak
p36494
aVBut truth is truth large lengths of seas and shores
p36495
aVBetween my father and my mother lay
p36496
aVAs I have heard my father speak himself
p36497
aVWhen this same lusty gentleman was got
p36498
aVUpon his deathbed he by will bequeathed
p36499
aVHis lands to me and took it on his death
p36500
aVThat this my mother\u2019s son was none of his
p36501
aVAn if he were he came into the world
p36502
aVFull fourteen weeks before the course of time
p36503
aVThen good my liege let me have what is mine
p36504
aVMy father\u2019s land as was my father\u2019s will
p36505
aVSirrah your brother is legitimate
p36506
aVYour father\u2019s wife did after wedlock bear him
p36507
aVAn if she did play false the fault was hers
p36508
aVWhich fault lies on the hazards of all husbands
p36509
aVThat marry wives Tell me how if my brother
p36510
aVWho as you say took pains to get this son
p36511
aVHad of your father claimed this son for his
p36512
aVIn sooth good friend your father might have kept
p36513
aVThis calf bred from his cow from all the world
p36514
aVIn sooth he might Then if he were my brother\u2019s
p36515
aVMy brother might not claim him nor your father
p36516
aVBeing none of his refuse him This concludes
p36517
aVMy mother\u2019s son did get your father\u2019s heir
p36518
aVYour father\u2019s heir must have your father\u2019s land
p36519
aVShall then my father\u2019s will be of no force
p36520
aVTo dispossess that child which is not his
p36521
aVOf no more force to dispossess me sir
p36522
aVThan was his will to get me as I think
p36523
aVWhether hadst thou rather be a Faulconbridge
p36524
aVAnd like thy brother to enjoy thy land
p36525
aVOr the reputed son of Coeur de Lion
p36526
aVLord of thy presence and no land besides
p36527
aVMadam an if my brother had my shape
p36528
aVAnd I had his Sir Robert\u2019s his like him

aVAnd if my legs were two such riding-rods

aVMy arms such eel-skins stuffed my face so thin
p36531
aVThat in mine ear I durst not stick a rose
p36532
aVLest men should say Look where three-farthings goes

aVFrom a resolved and honorable war

aVTo a most base and vile-concluded peace
p37263
aVAnd why rail I on this Commodity
p37264
aVBut for because he hath not wooed me yet
p37265
aVNot that I have the power to clutch my hand
p37266
aVWhen his fair angels would salute my palm
p37267
aVBut for my hand as unattempted yet

aVWell whiles I am a beggar I will rail

aVThat it in golden letters should be set

aVAmong the high tides in the calendar

aVBut now in arms you strengthen it with yours
p37379
aVThe grappling vigor and rough frown of war
p37380

aVThou wear a lion\u2019s hide Doff it for shame

aVAnd hang a calfskin on those recreant limbs
p37406

aVHere comes the holy legate of the Pope
p37412
aVHail you anointed deputies of heaven
p37413
aVTo thee King John my holy errand is
p37414
aVI Pandulph of fair Milan cardinal
p37415
aVAnd from Pope Innocent the legate here
p37416
aVDo in his name religiously demand
p37417
aVWhy thou against the Church our holy mother
p37418
aVSo willfully dost spurn and force perforce
p37419
aVKeep Stephen Langton chosen Archbishop
p37420
aVOf Canterbury from that Holy See
p37421
aVThis in our foresaid Holy Father\u2019s name
p37422
aVPope Innocent I do demand of thee
p37423
aVWhat earthy name to interrogatories
p37424
aVCan task the free breath of a sacred king
p37425
aVThou canst not cardinal devise a name
p37426
aVSo slight unworthy and ridiculous
p37427
aVTo charge me to an answer as the Pope
p37428
aVTell him this tale and from the mouth of England
p37429
aVAdd thus much more that no Italian priest
p37430
aVShall tithe or toll in our dominions
p37431
aVBut as we under God are supreme head
p37432
aVSo under Him that great supremacy
p37433
aVWhere we do reign we will alone uphold
p37434
aVWithout th\u2019 assistance of a mortal hand
p37435
aVSo tell the Pope all reverence set apart
p37436
aVTo him and his usurped authority
p37437
aVBrother of England you blaspheme in this
p37438
aVThough you and all the kings of Christendom
p37439
aVAre led so grossly by this meddling priest
p37440
aVDreading the curse that money may buy out
p37441
aVAnd by the merit of vile gold dross dust
p37442
aVPurchase corrupted pardon of a man
p37443
aVWho in that sale sells pardon from himself
p37444
aVThough you and all the rest so grossly led
p37445
aVThis juggling witchcraft with revenue cherish
p37446
aVYet I alone alone do me oppose
p37447
aVAgainst the Pope and count his friends my foes
p37448
aVThen by the lawful power that I have
p37449
aVThou shalt stand cursed and excommunicate
p37450
aVAnd blessèd shall he be that doth revolt
p37451
aVFrom his allegiance to an heretic
p37452
aVAnd meritorious shall that hand be called
p37453
aVCanonizèd and worshiped as a saint
p37454
aVThat takes away by any secret course
p37455
aVThy hateful life
p37456
aVO lawful let it be
p37457
aVThat I have room with Rome to curse awhile
p37458
aVGood father cardinal cry thou Amen
p37459
aVTo my keen curses for without my wrong
p37460
aVThere is no tongue hath power to curse him right
p37461
aVThere\u2019s law and warrant lady for my curse
p37462
aVAnd for mine too When law can do no right
p37463
aVLet it be lawful that law bar no wrong
p37464
aVLaw cannot give my child his kingdom here
p37465
aVFor he that holds his kingdom holds the law
p37466
aVTherefore since law itself is perfect wrong
p37467
aVHow can the law forbid my tongue to curse
p37468
aVPhilip of France on peril of a curse
p37469
aVLet go the hand of that arch-heretic
p37470
aVAnd raise the power of France upon his head
p37471
aVUnless he do submit himself to Rome
p37472
aVLook\u2019st thou pale France Do not let go thy hand
p37473
aVLook to that devil lest that France repent
p37474
aVAnd by disjoining hands hell lose a soul
p37475
aVKing Philip listen to the Cardinal
p37476
aVAnd hang a calfskin on his recreant limbs
p37477
aVWell ruffian I must pocket up these wrongs
p37478
aVBecause
p37479
aVYour breeches best may carry them
p37480
aVPhilip what sayst thou to the Cardinal
p37481
aVWhat should he say but as the Cardinal
p37482
aVBethink you father for the difference
p37483
aVIs purchase of a heavy curse from Rome
p37484
aVOr the light loss of England for a friend
p37485
aVForgo the easier
p37486
aVThat\u2019s the curse of Rome
p37487
aVO Louis stand fast The devil tempts thee here
p37488
aVIn likeness of a new untrimmèd bride
p37489
aVThe Lady Constance speaks not from her faith
p37490
aVBut from her need
p37491
aVO if thou grant my need
p37492
aVWhich only lives but by the death of faith
p37493
aVThat need must needs infer this principle
p37494
aVThat faith would live again by death of need
p37495
aVO then tread down my need and faith mounts up
p37496
aVKeep my need up and faith is trodden down
p37497
aVThe King is moved and answers not to this
p37498
aVO be removed from him and answer well
p37499
aVDo so King Philip Hang no more in doubt
p37500
aVHang nothing but a calfskin most sweet lout
p37501
aVI am perplexed and know not what to say
p37502
aVWhat canst thou say but will perplex thee more
p37503
aVIf thou stand excommunicate and cursed
p37504
aVGood reverend father make my person yours
p37505
aVAnd tell me how you would bestow yourself
p37506
aVThis royal hand and mine are newly knit
p37507
aVAnd the conjunction of our inward souls
p37508
aVMarried in league coupled and linked together
p37509
aVWith all religious strength of sacred vows
p37510
aVThe latest breath that gave the sound of words
p37511
aVWas deep-sworn faith peace amity true love
p37512
aVBetween our kingdoms and our royal selves
p37513
aVAnd even before this truce but new before
p37514
aVNo longer than we well could wash our hands
p37515
aVTo clap this royal bargain up of peace
p37516
aVGod knows they were besmeared and overstained
p37517
aVWith slaughter\u2019s pencil where revenge did paint
p37518
aVThe fearful difference of incensèd kings
p37519
aVAnd shall these hands so lately purged of blood
p37520
aVSo newly joined in love so strong in both
p37521
aVUnyoke this seizure and this kind regreet
p37522
aVPlay fast and loose with faith So jest with heaven
p37523
aVMake such unconstant children of ourselves
p37524
aVAs now again to snatch our palm from palm
p37525
aVUnswear faith sworn and on the marriage bed
p37526
aVOf smiling peace to march a bloody host
p37527
aVAnd make a riot on the gentle brow
p37528
aVOf true sincerity O holy sir
p37529
aVMy reverend father let it not be so
p37530
aVOut of your grace devise ordain impose
p37531
aVSome gentle order and then we shall be blest
p37532
aVTo do your pleasure and continue friends
p37533
aVAll form is formless order orderless
p37534
aVSave what is opposite to England\u2019s love
p37535
aVTherefore to arms Be champion of our Church
p37536
aVOr let the Church our mother breathe her curse
p37537
aVA mother\u2019s curse on her revolting son
p37538
aVFrance thou mayst hold a serpent by the tongue
p37539
aVA chafèd lion by the mortal paw
p37540
aVA fasting tiger safer by the tooth
p37541
aVThan keep in peace that hand which thou dost hold
p37542
aVI may disjoin my hand but not my faith
p37543
aVSo mak\u2019st thou faith an enemy to faith
p37544
aVAnd like a civil war sett\u2019st oath to oath
p37545
aVThy tongue against thy tongue O let thy vow
p37546
aVFirst made to God first be to God performed
p37547
aVThat is to be the champion of our Church
p37548
aVWhat since thou swor\u2019st is sworn against thyself
p37549
aVAnd may not be performèd by thyself
p37550
aVFor that which thou hast sworn to do amiss
p37551
aVIs not amiss when it is truly done
p37552
aVAnd being not done where doing tends to ill
p37553
aVThe truth is then most done not doing it
p37554
aVThe better act of purposes mistook
p37555
aVIs to mistake again though indirect
p37556
aVYet indirection thereby grows direct
p37557
aVAnd falsehood falsehood cures as fire cools fire
p37558
aVWithin the scorchèd veins of one new-burned
p37559
aVIt is religion that doth make vows kept
p37560
aVBut thou hast sworn against religion
p37561
aVBy what thou swear\u2019st against the thing thou swear\u2019st
p37562
aVAnd mak\u2019st an oath the surety for thy truth
p37563
aVAgainst an oath The truth thou art unsure
p37564
aVTo swear swears only not to be forsworn
p37565
aVElse what a mockery should it be to swear
p37566
aVBut thou dost swear only to be forsworn
p37567
aVAnd most forsworn to keep what thou dost swear
p37568
aVTherefore thy later vows against thy first
p37569

aVWhich cannot hear a lady\u2019s feeble voice

aVWhich scorns a modern invocation
p37767
aVLady you utter madness and not sorrow
p37768
aVThou art not holy to belie me so
p37769
aVI am not mad This hair I tear is mine
p37770
aVMy name is Constance I was Geoffrey\u2019s wife
p37771
aVYoung Arthur is my son and he is lost
p37772
aVI am not mad I would to heaven I were
p37773
aVFor then \u2019tis like I should forget myself
p37774
aVO if I could what grief should I forget
p37775
aVPreach some philosophy to make me mad
p37776
aVAnd thou shalt be canonized cardinal
p37777
aVFor being not mad but sensible of grief
p37778
aVMy reasonable part produces reason
p37779
aVHow I may be delivered of these woes
p37780
aVAnd teaches me to kill or hang myself
p37781
aVIf I were mad I should forget my son
p37782
aVOr madly think a babe of clouts were he
p37783
aVI am not mad Too well too well I feel
p37784
aVThe different plague of each calamity
p37785
aVBind up those tresses O what love I note
p37786
aVIn the fair multitude of those her hairs
p37787
aVWhere but by chance a silver drop hath fall\u2019n
p37788
aVEven to that drop ten thousand wiry friends
p37789
aVDo glue themselves in sociable grief
p37790
aVLike true inseparable faithful loves
p37791
aVSticking together in calamity
p37792
aVTo England if you will
p37793
aVBind up your hairs
p37794
aVYes that I will And wherefore will I do it
p37795
aVI tore them from their bonds and cried aloud
p37796
aVO that these hands could so redeem my son
p37797
aVAs they have given these hairs their liberty
p37798
aVBut now I envy at their liberty
p37799
aVAnd will again commit them to their bonds
p37800
aVBecause my poor child is a prisoner
p37801
aVAnd father cardinal I have heard you say
p37802
aVThat we shall see and know our friends in heaven
p37803
aVIf that be true I shall see my boy again
p37804
aVFor since the birth of Cain the first male child
p37805
aVTo him that did but yesterday suspire
p37806
aVThere was not such a gracious creature born
p37807
aVBut now will canker sorrow eat my bud
p37808
aVAnd chase the native beauty from his cheek
p37809
aVAnd he will look as hollow as a ghost
p37810
aVAs dim and meager as an ague\u2019s fit
p37811
aVAnd so he\u2019ll die and rising so again
p37812
aVWhen I shall meet him in the court of heaven
p37813
aVI shall not know him Therefore never never
p37814
aVMust I behold my pretty Arthur more
p37815
aVYou hold too heinous a respect of grief
p37816
aVHe talks to me that never had a son
p37817
aVYou are as fond of grief as of your child
p37818
aVGrief fills the room up of my absent child
p37819
aVLies in his bed walks up and down with me
p37820
aVPuts on his pretty looks repeats his words
p37821
aVRemembers me of all his gracious parts
p37822
aVStuffs out his vacant garments with his form
p37823
aVThen have I reason to be fond of grief
p37824
aVFare you well Had you such a loss as I
p37825
aVI could give better comfort than you do
p37826
aVI will not keep this form upon my head
p37827
aVWhen there is such disorder in my wit
p37828
aVO Lord My boy my Arthur my fair son
p37829
aVMy life my joy my food my all the world
p37830
aVMy widow-comfort and my sorrows\u2019 cure
p37831
aVI fear some outrage and I\u2019ll follow her
p37832
aVThere\u2019s nothing in this world can make me joy
p37833
aVLife is as tedious as a twice-told tale
p37834
aVVexing the dull ear of a drowsy man
p37835
aVAnd bitter shame hath spoiled the sweet world\u2019s taste
p37836
aVThat it yields naught but shame and bitterness
p37837
aVBefore the curing of a strong disease
p37838
aVEven in the instant of repair and health
p37839
aVThe fit is strongest Evils that take leave
p37840
aVOn their departure most of all show evil
p37841
aVWhat have you lost by losing of this day
p37842
aVAll days of glory joy and happiness
p37843
aVIf you had won it certainly you had
p37844
aVNo no When Fortune means to men most good
p37845
aVShe looks upon them with a threat\u2019ning eye
p37846
aV\u2019Tis strange to think how much King John hath lost
p37847
aVIn this which he accounts so clearly won
p37848
aVAre not you grieved that Arthur is his prisoner
p37849
aVAs heartily as he is glad he hath him
p37850
aVYour mind is all as youthful as your blood
p37851
aVNow hear me speak with a prophetic spirit
p37852
aVFor even the breath of what I mean to speak
p37853
aVShall blow each dust each straw each little rub
p37854
aVOut of the path which shall directly lead
p37855
aVThy foot to England\u2019s throne And therefore mark
p37856
aVJohn hath seized Arthur and it cannot be
p37857
aVThat whiles warm life plays in that infant\u2019s veins
p37858
aVThe misplaced John should entertain an hour
p37859
aVOne minute nay one quiet breath of rest
p37860
aVA scepter snatched with an unruly hand
p37861
aVMust be as boisterously maintained as gained
p37862
aVAnd he that stands upon a slipp\u2019ry place
p37863
aVMakes nice of no vile hold to stay him up
p37864
aVThat John may stand then Arthur needs must fall
p37865
aVSo be it for it cannot be but so
p37866
aVBut what shall I gain by young Arthur\u2019s fall
p37867
aVYou in the right of Lady Blanche your wife
p37868
aVMay then make all the claim that Arthur did
p37869
aVAnd lose it life and all as Arthur did
p37870
aVHow green you are and fresh in this old world
p37871
aVJohn lays you plots The times conspire with you
p37872
aVFor he that steeps his safety in true blood
p37873
aVShall find but bloody safety and untrue
p37874
aVThis act so evilly borne shall cool the hearts
p37875
aVOf all his people and freeze up their zeal
p37876
aVThat none so small advantage shall step forth
p37877
aVTo check his reign but they will cherish it
p37878
aVNo natural exhalation in the sky
p37879
aVNo scope of nature no distempered day
p37880
aVNo common wind no customèd event
p37881
aVBut they will pluck away his natural cause
p37882
aVAnd call them meteors prodigies and signs
p37883
aVAbortives presages and tongues of heaven
p37884
aVPlainly denouncing vengeance upon John
p37885
aVMaybe he will not touch young Arthur\u2019s life
p37886
aVBut hold himself safe in his prisonment
p37887
aVO sir when he shall hear of your approach
p37888
aVIf that young Arthur be not gone already
p37889
aVEven at that news he dies and then the hearts
p37890
aVOf all his people shall revolt from him
p37891
aVAnd kiss the lips of unacquainted change
p37892
aVAnd pick strong matter of revolt and wrath
p37893
aVOut of the bloody fingers\u2019 ends of John
p37894
aVMethinks I see this hurly all on foot
p37895
aVAnd O what better matter breeds for you
p37896
aVThan I have named The bastard Faulconbridge
p37897
aVIs now in England ransacking the Church
p37898
aVOffending charity If but a dozen French
p37899
aVWere there in arms they would be as a call
p37900
aVTo train ten thousand English to their side
p37901
aVOr as a little snow tumbled about
p37902
aVAnon becomes a mountain O noble dauphin
p37903
aVGo with me to the King \u2019Tis wonderful
p37904
aVWhat may be wrought out of their discontent
p37905
aVNow that their souls are topful of offense
p37906
aVFor England go I will whet on the King
p37907
aVStrong reasons makes strange actions Let us go
p37908
aVIf you say ay the King will not say no
p37909
aVHeat me these irons hot and look thou stand
p37910
aVWithin the arras When I strike my foot
p37911
aVUpon the bosom of the ground rush forth
p37912
aVAnd bind the boy which you shall find with me
p37913
aVFast to the chair Be heedful Hence and watch
p37914
aVI hope your warrant will bear out the deed
p37915
aVUncleanly scruples fear not you Look to \u2019t
p37916
aVYoung lad come forth I have to say with you
p37917
aVGood morrow Hubert

aVGood morrow little prince
p37919
aVAs little prince having so great a title
p37920
aVTo be more prince as may be You are sad
p37921
aVIndeed I have been merrier
p37922
aVMercy on me
p37923
aVMethinks nobody should be sad but I
p37924
aVYet I remember when I was in France
p37925
aVYoung gentlemen would be as sad as night
p37926
aVOnly for wantonness By my christendom
p37927
aVSo I were out of prison and kept sheep
p37928
aVI should be as merry as the day is long
p37929
aVAnd so I would be here but that I doubt
p37930
aVMy uncle practices more harm to me
p37931
aVHe is afraid of me and I of him
p37932
aVIs it my fault that I was Geoffrey\u2019s son
p37933
aVNo indeed is \u2019t not And I would to heaven
p37934
aVI were your son so you would love me Hubert
p37935
aVIf I talk to him with his innocent prate
p37936
aVHe will awake my mercy which lies dead
p37937
aVTherefore I will be sudden and dispatch
p37938
aVAre you sick Hubert You look pale today
p37939
aVIn sooth I would you were a little sick
p37940
aVThat I might sit all night and watch with you
p37941
aVI warrant I love you more than you do me
p37942
aVHis words do take possession of my bosom
p37943
aVRead here young Arthur Aside How now foolish rheum
p37944
aVTurning dispiteous torture out of door
p37945
aVI must be brief lest resolution drop
p37946
aVOut at mine eyes in tender womanish tears
p37947
aVCan you not read it Is it not fair writ
p37948
aVToo fairly Hubert for so foul effect
p37949
aVMust you with hot irons burn out both mine eyes
p37950
aVYoung boy I must
p37951
aVAnd will you
p37952
aVAnd I will
p37953
aVHave you the heart When your head did but ache
p37954
aVI knit my handkercher about your brows
p37955
aVThe best I had a princess wrought it me
p37956
aVAnd I did never ask it you again
p37957
aVAnd with my hand at midnight held your head
p37958
aVAnd like the watchful minutes to the hour
p37959
aVStill and anon cheered up the heavy time
p37960
aVSaying What lack you and Where lies your grief
p37961
aVOr What good love may I perform for you
p37962
aVMany a poor man\u2019s son would have lien still
p37963
aVAnd ne\u2019er have spoke a loving word to you
p37964
aVBut you at your sick service had a prince
p37965
aVNay you may think my love was crafty love
p37966
aVAnd call it cunning Do an if you will
p37967
aVIf heaven be pleased that you must use me ill
p37968
aVWhy then you must Will you put out mine eyes
p37969
aVThese eyes that never did nor never shall
p37970
aVSo much as frown on you
p37971
aVI have sworn to do it
p37972
aVAnd with hot irons must I burn them out
p37973
aVAh none but in this Iron Age would do it
p37974
aVThe iron of itself though heat red-hot
p37975
aVApproaching near these eyes would drink my tears
p37976
aVAnd quench this fiery indignation
p37977
aVEven in the matter of mine innocence
p37978
aVNay after that consume away in rust
p37979
aVBut for containing fire to harm mine eye
p37980
aVAre you more stubborn-hard than hammered iron
p37981
aVAn if an angel should have come to me
p37982
aVAnd told me Hubert should put out mine eyes
p37983
aVI would not have believed him No tongue but Hubert\u2019s
p37984
aVO save me Hubert save me My eyes are out
p37985
aVEven with the fierce looks of these bloody men
p37986
aVGive me the iron I say and bind him here
p37987
aVAlas what need you be so boist\u2019rous-rough
p37988
aVI will not struggle I will stand stone-still
p37989
aVFor God\u2019s sake Hubert let me not be bound
p37990
aVNay hear me Hubert Drive these men away
p37991
aVAnd I will sit as quiet as a lamb
p37992
aVI will not stir nor wince nor speak a word
p37993
aVNor look upon the iron angerly
p37994
aVThrust but these men away and I\u2019ll forgive you
p37995
aVWhatever torment you do put me to
p37996
aVGo stand within Let me alone with him
p37997
aVI am best pleased to be from such a deed
p37998
aVAlas I then have chid away my friend
p37999
aVHe hath a stern look but a gentle heart
p38000
aVLet him come back that his compassion may
p38001
aVGive life to yours
p38002
aVCome boy prepare yourself
p38003
aVIs there no remedy
p38004
aVNone but to lose your eyes
p38005
aVO God that there were but a mote in yours
p38006
aVA grain a dust a gnat a wandering hair
p38007
aVAny annoyance in that precious sense
p38008
aVThen feeling what small things are boisterous there
p38009
aVYour vile intent must needs seem horrible
p38010
aVIs this your promise Go to hold your tongue
p38011
aVHubert the utterance of a brace of tongues
p38012
aVMust needs want pleading for a pair of eyes
p38013
aVLet me not hold my tongue Let me not Hubert
p38014
aVOr Hubert if you will cut out my tongue
p38015
aVSo I may keep mine eyes O spare mine eyes
p38016
aVThough to no use but still to look on you
p38017
aVLo by my troth the instrument is cold
p38018
aVAnd would not harm me
p38019
aVI can heat it boy
p38020
aVNo in good sooth The fire is dead with grief
p38021
aVBeing create for comfort to be used
p38022
aVIn undeserved extremes See else yourself
p38023
aVThere is no malice in this burning coal
p38024
aVThe breath of heaven hath blown his spirit out
p38025
aVAnd strewed repentant ashes on his head
p38026
aVBut with my breath I can revive it boy
p38027
aVAn if you do you will but make it blush
p38028
aVAnd glow with shame of your proceedings Hubert
p38029
aVNay it perchance will sparkle in your eyes
p38030
aVAnd like a dog that is compelled to fight
p38031
aVSnatch at his master that doth tar him on
p38032
aVAll things that you should use to do me wrong
p38033
aVDeny their office Only you do lack
p38034
aVThat mercy which fierce fire and iron extends
p38035
aVCreatures of note for mercy-lacking uses
p38036
aVWell see to live I will not touch thine eye
p38037
aVFor all the treasure that thine uncle owes
p38038
aVYet am I sworn and I did purpose boy
p38039
aVWith this same very iron to burn them out
p38040
aVO now you look like Hubert All this while
p38041
aVYou were disguisèd
p38042
aVPeace No more Adieu
p38043
aVYour uncle must not know but you are dead
p38044
aVI\u2019ll fill these doggèd spies with false reports
p38045
aVAnd pretty child sleep doubtless and secure
p38046
aVThat Hubert for the wealth of all the world
p38047
aVWill not offend thee
p38048
aVO heaven I thank you Hubert
p38049
aVSilence No more Go closely in with me
p38050
aVMuch danger do I undergo for thee
p38051
aVHere once again we sit once again crowned
p38052
aVAnd looked upon I hope with cheerful eyes
p38053
aVThis once again but that your Highness pleased
p38054
aVWas once superfluous You were crowned before
p38055
aVAnd that high royalty was ne\u2019er plucked off
p38056
aVThe faiths of men ne\u2019er stainèd with revolt
p38057
aVFresh expectation troubled not the land
p38058
aVWith any longed-for change or better state
p38059
aVTherefore to be possessed with double pomp
p38060
aVTo guard a title that was rich before
p38061
aVTo gild refinèd gold to paint the lily
p38062
aVTo throw a perfume on the violet
p38063
aVTo smooth the ice or add another hue
p38064
aVUnto the rainbow or with taper-light
p38065
aVTo seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish
p38066
aVIs wasteful and ridiculous excess
p38067
aVBut that your royal pleasure must be done
p38068
aVThis act is as an ancient tale new told
p38069
aVAnd in the last repeating troublesome
p38070
aVBeing urgèd at a time unseasonable
p38071
aVIn this the antique and well-noted face
p38072
aVOf plain old form is much disfigurèd
p38073
aVAnd like a shifted wind unto a sail
p38074
aVIt makes the course of thoughts to fetch about
p38075
aVStartles and frights consideration
p38076
aVMakes sound opinion sick and truth suspected
p38077
aVFor putting on so new a fashioned robe
p38078
aVWhen workmen strive to do better than well
p38079
aVThey do confound their skill in covetousness
p38080
aVAnd oftentimes excusing of a fault
p38081
aVDoth make the fault the worse by th\u2019 excuse
p38082
aVAs patches set upon a little breach
p38083
aVDiscredit more in hiding of the fault
p38084
aVThan did the fault before it was so patched
p38085
aVTo this effect before you were new-crowned
p38086
aVWe breathed our counsel but it pleased your Highness
p38087
aVTo overbear it and we are all well pleased
p38088
aVSince all and every part of what we would
p38089
aVDoth make a stand at what your Highness will
p38090
aVSome reasons of this double coronation
p38091
aVI have possessed you with and think them strong
p38092
aVAnd more more strong when lesser is my fear
p38093
aVI shall endue you with Meantime but ask
p38094
aVWhat you would have reformed that is not well
p38095
aVAnd well shall you perceive how willingly
p38096
aVI will both hear and grant you your requests
p38097
aVThen I as one that am the tongue of these
p38098
aVTo sound the purposes of all their hearts
p38099
aVBoth for myself and them but chief of all
p38100
aVYour safety for the which myself and them
p38101
aVBend their best studies heartily request
p38102
aVTh\u2019 enfranchisement of Arthur whose restraint
p38103
aVDoth move the murmuring lips of discontent
p38104
aVTo break into this dangerous argument
p38105
aVIf what in rest you have in right you hold
p38106
aVWhy then your fears which as they say attend
p38107
aVThe steps of wrong should move you to mew up
p38108
aVYour tender kinsman and to choke his days
p38109
aVWith barbarous ignorance and deny his youth
p38110
aVThe rich advantage of good exercise
p38111
aVThat the time\u2019s enemies may not have this
p38112
aVTo grace occasions let it be our suit
p38113
aVThat you have bid us ask his liberty
p38114
aVWhich for our goods we do no further ask
p38115
aVThan whereupon our weal on you depending
p38116
aVCounts it your weal he have his liberty
p38117
aVLet it be so I do commit his youth
p38118
aVTo your direction
p38119
aVHubert what news with you
p38120
aVThis is the man should do the bloody deed
p38121
aVHe showed his warrant to a friend of mine
p38122
aVThe image of a wicked heinous fault
p38123
aVLives in his eye That close aspect of his
p38124
aVDoth show the mood of a much troubled breast
p38125
aVAnd I do fearfully believe \u2019tis done
p38126
aVWhat we so feared he had a charge to do
p38127
aVThe color of the King doth come and go
p38128
aVBetween his purpose and his conscience
p38129
aVLike heralds \u2019twixt two dreadful battles set
p38130
aVHis passion is so ripe it needs must break
p38131
aVAnd when it breaks I fear will issue thence
p38132
aVThe foul corruption of a sweet child\u2019s death
p38133
aVWe cannot hold mortality\u2019s strong hand
p38134
aVGood lords although my will to give is living
p38135
aVThe suit which you demand is gone and dead
p38136
aVHe tells us Arthur is deceased tonight
p38137
aVIndeed we feared his sickness was past cure
p38138
aVIndeed we heard how near his death he was
p38139
aVBefore the child himself felt he was sick
p38140
aVThis must be answered either here or hence
p38141
aVWhy do you bend such solemn brows on me
p38142
aVThink you I bear the shears of destiny
p38143
aVHave I commandment on the pulse of life
p38144
aVIt is apparent foul play and \u2019tis shame
p38145
aVThat greatness should so grossly offer it
p38146
aVSo thrive it in your game and so farewell
p38147
aVStay yet Lord Salisbury I\u2019ll go with thee
p38148
aVAnd find th\u2019 inheritance of this poor child
p38149
aVHis little kingdom of a forcèd grave
p38150
aVThat blood which owed the breadth of all this isle
p38151
aVThree foot of it doth hold Bad world the while
p38152
aVThis must not be thus borne this will break out
p38153
aVTo all our sorrows and ere long I doubt
p38154
aVThey burn in indignation I repent
p38155
aVThere is no sure foundation set on blood
p38156
aVNo certain life achieved by others\u2019 death
p38157
aVA fearful eye thou hast Where is that blood
p38158
aVThat I have seen inhabit in those cheeks
p38159
aVSo foul a sky clears not without a storm
p38160
aVPour down thy weather how goes all in France
p38161
aVFrom France to England Never such a power
p38162
aVFor any foreign preparation
p38163
aVWas levied in the body of a land
p38164
aVThe copy of your speed is learned by them
p38165
aVFor when you should be told they do prepare
p38166
aVThe tidings comes that they are all arrived
p38167
aVO where hath our intelligence been drunk
p38168
aVWhere hath it slept Where is my mother\u2019s care
p38169
aVThat such an army could be drawn in France
p38170
aVAnd she not hear of it
p38171
aVMy liege her ear
p38172
aVIs stopped with dust The first of April died
p38173
aVYour noble mother And as I hear my lord
p38174
aVThe Lady Constance in a frenzy died
p38175
aVThree days before But this from rumor\u2019s tongue
p38176
aVI idly heard If true or false I know not
p38177
aVWithhold thy speed dreadful occasion
p38178
aVO make a league with me till I have pleased
p38179
aVMy discontented peers What Mother dead
p38180
aVHow wildly then walks my estate in France
p38181
aVUnder whose conduct came those powers of France
p38182
aVThat thou for truth giv\u2019st out are landed here
p38183
aVUnder the Dauphin
p38184
aVThou hast made me giddy
p38185
aVWith these ill tidings
p38186
aVNow what says the world
p38187
aVTo your proceedings Do not seek to stuff
p38188
aVMy head with more ill news for it is full
p38189
aVBut if you be afeard to hear the worst
p38190
aVThen let the worst unheard fall on your head
p38191
aVBear with me cousin for I was amazed
p38192
aVUnder the tide but now I breathe again
p38193
aVAloft the flood and can give audience
p38194
aVTo any tongue speak it of what it will
p38195
aVHow I have sped among the clergymen
p38196
aVThe sums I have collected shall express
p38197
aVBut as I traveled hither through the land
p38198
aVI find the people strangely fantasied
p38199
aVPossessed with rumors full of idle dreams
p38200
aVNot knowing what they fear but full of fear
p38201
aVAnd here\u2019s a prophet that I brought with me
p38202
aVFrom forth the streets of Pomfret whom I found
p38203
aVWith many hundreds treading on his heels
p38204
aVTo whom he sung in rude harsh-sounding rhymes
p38205
aVThat ere the next Ascension Day at noon
p38206
aVYour Highness should deliver up your crown
p38207
aVThou idle dreamer wherefore didst thou so
p38208
aVForeknowing that the truth will fall out so
p38209
aVHubert away with him Imprison him
p38210
aVAnd on that day at noon whereon he says
p38211
aVI shall yield up my crown let him be hanged
p38212
aVDeliver him to safety and return
p38213
aVFor I must use thee
p38214
aVO my gentle cousin

aVHear\u2019st thou the news abroad who are arrived
p38216
aVThe French my lord Men\u2019s mouths are full of it
p38217
aVBesides I met Lord Bigot and Lord Salisbury
p38218
aVWith eyes as red as new-enkindled fire
p38219
aVAnd others more going to seek the grave
p38220
aVOf Arthur whom they say is killed tonight
p38221
aVOn your suggestion
p38222
aVGentle kinsman go
p38223
aVAnd thrust thyself into their companies

aVBring them before me

aVI will seek them out
p38227
aVNay but make haste the better foot before
p38228
aVO let me have no subject enemies
p38229
aVWhen adverse foreigners affright my towns
p38230
aVWith dreadful pomp of stout invasion
p38231
aVBe Mercury set feathers to thy heels
p38232
aVAnd fly like thought from them to me again
p38233
aVThe spirit of the time shall teach me speed
p38234
aVSpoke like a sprightful noble gentleman
p38235
aVTo Messenger Go after him for he perhaps shall need
p38236
aVSome messenger betwixt me and the peers
p38237
aVAnd be thou he
p38238
aVWith all my heart my liege
p38239
aVMy mother dead
p38240
aVMy lord they say five moons were seen tonight
p38241
aVFour fixèd and the fifth did whirl about
p38242
aVThe other four in wondrous motion
p38243
aVFive moons
p38244
aVOld men and beldams in the streets
p38245
aVDo prophesy upon it dangerously
p38246
aVYoung Arthur\u2019s death is common in their mouths
p38247
aVAnd when they talk of him they shake their heads
p38248
aVAnd whisper one another in the ear
p38249
aVAnd he that speaks doth grip the hearer\u2019s wrist
p38250
aVWhilst he that hears makes fearful action
p38251
aVWith wrinkled brows with nods with rolling eyes
p38252
aVI saw a smith stand with his hammer thus
p38253
aVThe whilst his iron did on the anvil cool
p38254
aVWith open mouth swallowing a tailor\u2019s news
p38255
aVWho with his shears and measure in his hand
p38256
aVStanding on slippers which his nimble haste
p38257
aVHad falsely thrust upon contrary feet
p38258
aVTold of a many thousand warlike French
p38259
aVThat were embattlèd and ranked in Kent
p38260
aVAnother lean unwashed artificer
p38261
aVCuts off his tale and talks of Arthur\u2019s death
p38262
aVWhy seek\u2019st thou to possess me with these fears
p38263
aVWhy urgest thou so oft young Arthur\u2019s death
p38264
aVThy hand hath murdered him I had a mighty cause
p38265
aVTo wish him dead but thou hadst none to kill him
p38266
aVNo had my lord Why did you not provoke me
p38267
aVIt is the curse of kings to be attended
p38268
aVBy slaves that take their humors for a warrant
p38269
aVTo break within the bloody house of life
p38270
aVAnd on the winking of authority
p38271
aVTo understand a law to know the meaning
p38272
aVOf dangerous majesty when perchance it frowns
p38273
aVMore upon humor than advised respect
p38274
aVHere is your hand and seal for what I did
p38275
aVO when the last accompt twixt heaven and Earth
p38276
aVIs to be made then shall this hand and seal
p38277
aVWitness against us to damnation
p38278
aVHow oft the sight of means to do ill deeds
p38279
aVMake deeds ill done Hadst not thou been by
p38280
aVA fellow by the hand of nature marked
p38281
aVQuoted and signed to do a deed of shame
p38282
aVThis murder had not come into my mind
p38283
aVBut taking note of thy abhorred aspect
p38284
aVFinding thee fit for bloody villainy
p38285
aVApt liable to be employed in danger
p38286
aVI faintly broke with thee of Arthur\u2019s death
p38287
aVAnd thou to be endearèd to a king
p38288
aVMade it no conscience to destroy a prince
p38289
aVMy lord
p38290
aVHadst thou but shook thy head or made a pause
p38291
aVWhen I spake darkly what I purposèd
p38292
aVOr turned an eye of doubt upon my face
p38293
aVAs bid me tell my tale in express words
p38294
aVDeep shame had struck me dumb made me break off
p38295
aVAnd those thy fears might have wrought fears in me
p38296
aVBut thou didst understand me by my signs
p38297
aVAnd didst in signs again parley with sin
p38298
aVYea without stop didst let thy heart consent
p38299
aVAnd consequently thy rude hand to act
p38300
aVThe deed which both our tongues held vile to name
p38301
aVOut of my sight and never see me more
p38302
aVMy nobles leave me and my state is braved
p38303
aVEven at my gates with ranks of foreign powers

aVNay in the body of this fleshly land

aVArm you against your other enemies
p38309
aVI\u2019ll make a peace between your soul and you
p38310
aVYoung Arthur is alive This hand of mine
p38311
aVIs yet a maiden and an innocent hand
p38312
aVNot painted with the crimson spots of blood
p38313
aVWithin this bosom never entered yet
p38314
aVThe dreadful motion of a murderous thought
p38315
aVAnd you have slandered nature in my form
p38316
aVWhich howsoever rude exteriorly
p38317
aVIs yet the cover of a fairer mind
p38318
aVThan to be butcher of an innocent child
p38319
aVDoth Arthur live O haste thee to the peers
p38320
aVThrow this report on their incensèd rage
p38321
aVAnd make them tame to their obedience
p38322
aVForgive the comment that my passion made
p38323
aVUpon thy feature for my rage was blind
p38324
aVAnd foul imaginary eyes of blood
p38325
aVPresented thee more hideous than thou art
p38326
aVO answer not but to my closet bring
p38327
aVThe angry lords with all expedient haste
p38328
aVI conjure thee but slowly run more fast
p38329
aVThe wall is high and yet will I leap down
p38330
aVGood ground be pitiful and hurt me not
p38331
aVThere\u2019s few or none do know me If they did
p38332
aVThis shipboy\u2019s semblance hath disguised me quite
p38333
aVI am afraid and yet I\u2019ll venture it
p38334
aVIf I get down and do not break my limbs
p38335
aVI\u2019ll find a thousand shifts to get away
p38336
aVAs good to die and go as die and stay
p38337
aVO me my uncle\u2019s spirit is in these stones
p38338
aVHeaven take my soul and England keep my bones
p38339
aVLords I will meet him at Saint Edmundsbury
p38340
aVIt is our safety and we must embrace
p38341
aVThis gentle offer of the perilous time
p38342
aVWho brought that letter from the Cardinal
p38343
aVThe Count Melun a noble lord of France
p38344
aVWhose private with me of the Dauphin\u2019s love
p38345
aVIs much more general than these lines import
p38346
aVTomorrow morning let us meet him then
p38347
aVOr rather then set forward for \u2019twill be
p38348
aVTwo long days\u2019 journey lords or ere we meet

aVOnce more today well met distempered lords
p38350
aVThe King by me requests your presence straight
p38351
aVThe King hath dispossessed himself of us
p38352
aVWe will not line his thin bestainèd cloak
p38353
aVWith our pure honors nor attend the foot
p38354
aVThat leaves the print of blood where\u2019er it walks
p38355

aVThe wildest savagery the vilest stroke

aVThat ever wall-eyed wrath or staring rage
p38379
aVPresented to the tears of soft remorse
p38380
aVAll murders past do stand excused in this
p38381
aVAnd this so sole and so unmatchable

aVThe life the right and truth of all this realm
p38481
aVIs fled to heaven and England now is left
p38482
aVTo tug and scamble and to part by th\u2019 teeth

aVDoth doggèd war bristle his angry crest

aVTake again

aVFrom this my hand as holding of the Pope
p38500
aVYour sovereign greatness and authority

aVNow keep your holy word Go meet the French

aVAnd from his Holiness use all your power
p38503
aVTo stop their marches \u2019fore we are inflamed
p38504
aVOur discontented counties do revolt
p38505
aVOur people quarrel with obedience
p38506
aVSwearing allegiance and the love of soul
p38507
aVTo stranger blood to foreign royalty
p38508
aVThis inundation of mistempered humor

aVThen pause not for the present time\u2019s so sick
p38511
aVThat present med\u2019cine must be ministered
p38512
aVOr overthrow incurable ensues
p38513
aVIt was my breath that blew this tempest up
p38514
aVUpon your stubborn usage of the Pope
p38515
aVBut since you are a gentle convertite
p38516
aVMy tongue shall hush again this storm of war
p38517
aVAnd make fair weather in your blust\u2019ring land
p38518
aVOn this Ascension Day remember well
p38519
aVUpon your oath of service to the Pope
p38520
aVGo I to make the French lay down their arms
p38521
aVIs this Ascension Day Did not the prophet
p38522
aVSay that before Ascension Day at noon
p38523
aVMy crown I should give off Even so I have
p38524
aVI did suppose it should be on constraint
p38525
aVBut God be thanked it is but voluntary
p38526
aVAll Kent hath yielded Nothing there holds out
p38527
aVBut Dover Castle London hath received
p38528
aVLike a kind host the Dauphin and his powers
p38529
aVYour nobles will not hear you but are gone
p38530
aVTo offer service to your enemy
p38531
aVAnd wild amazement hurries up and down
p38532
aVThe little number of your doubtful friends
p38533
aVWould not my lords return to me again
p38534
aVAfter they heard young Arthur was alive
p38535
aVThey found him dead and cast into the streets
p38536
aVAn empty casket where the jewel of life
p38537
aVBy some damned hand was robbed and ta\u2019en away
p38538
aVThat villain Hubert told me he did live
p38539
aVSo on my soul he did for aught he knew
p38540
aVBut wherefore do you droop Why look you sad
p38541
aVBe great in act as you have been in thought
p38542
aVLet not the world see fear and sad distrust
p38543
aVGovern the motion of a kingly eye
p38544
aVBe stirring as the time be fire with fire
p38545
aVThreaten the threat\u2019ner and outface the brow
p38546
aVOf bragging horror So shall inferior eyes

aVAway and glister like the god of war
p38551
aVWhen he intendeth to become the field
p38552
aVShow boldness and aspiring confidence
p38553
aVWhat shall they seek the lion in his den
p38554
aVAnd fright him there And make him tremble there
p38555
aVO let it not be said Forage and run
p38556
aVTo meet displeasure farther from the doors
p38557
aVAnd grapple with him ere he come so nigh
p38558
aVThe legate of the Pope hath been with me
p38559
aVAnd I have made a happy peace with him
p38560
aVAnd he hath promised to dismiss the powers
p38561
aVLed by the Dauphin
p38562
aVO inglorious league

p38564
aVSend fair-play orders and make compromise
p38565
aVInsinuation parley and base truce
p38566
aVTo arms invasive Shall a beardless boy
p38567
aVA cockered silken wanton brave our fields
p38568
aVAnd flesh his spirit in a warlike soil
p38569
aVMocking the air with colors idly spread
p38570
aVAnd find no check Let us my liege to arms
p38571
aVPerchance the Cardinal cannot make your peace
p38572
aVOr if he do let it at least be said
p38573
aVThey saw we had a purpose of defense
p38574
aVHave thou the ordering of this present time
p38575
aVAway then with good courage Aside Yet I know
p38576
aVOur party may well meet a prouder foe
p38577
aVMy Lord Melun let this be copied out
p38578
aVAnd keep it safe for our remembrance
p38579
aVReturn the precedent to these lords again
p38580
aVThat having our fair order written down
p38581
aVBoth they and we perusing o\u2019er these notes

p38590
aVAnd heal the inveterate canker of one wound
p38591
aVBy making many O it grieves my soul
p38592
aVThat I must draw this metal from my side
p38593
aVTo be a widow-maker O and there
p38594
aVWhere honorable rescue and defense
p38595
aVCries out upon the name of Salisbury
p38596
aVBut such is the infection of the time
p38597
aVThat for the health and physic of our right
p38598
aVWe cannot deal but with the very hand
p38599
aVOf stern injustice and confusèd wrong
p38600
aVAnd is \u2019t not pity O my grievèd friends
p38601
aVThat we the sons and children of this isle
p38602
aVWas born to see so sad an hour as this
p38603
aVWherein we step after a stranger march
p38604
aVUpon her gentle bosom and fill up
p38605
aVHer enemies\u2019 ranks I must withdraw and weep
p38606
aVUpon the spot of this enforcèd cause
p38607
aVTo grace the gentry of a land remote
p38608
aVAnd follow unacquainted colors here
p38609
aVWhat here O nation that thou couldst remove
p38610
aVThat Neptune\u2019s arms who clippeth thee about
p38611
aVWould bear thee from the knowledge of thyself
p38612
aVAnd grapple thee unto a pagan shore
p38613
aVWhere these two Christian armies might combine
p38614
aVThe blood of malice in a vein of league
p38615
aVAnd not to spend it so unneighborly
p38616
aVA noble temper dost thou show in this
p38617
aVAnd great affections wrestling in thy bosom
p38618
aVDoth make an earthquake of nobility
p38619
aVO what a noble combat hast thou fought
p38620
aVBetween compulsion and a brave respect
p38621
aVLet me wipe off this honorable dew
p38622
aVThat silverly doth progress on thy cheeks
p38623
aVMy heart hath melted at a lady\u2019s tears
p38624
aVBeing an ordinary inundation
p38625
aVBut this effusion of such manly drops
p38626
aVThis shower blown up by tempest of the soul
p38627
aVStartles mine eyes and makes me more amazed
p38628
aVThan had I seen the vaulty top of heaven
p38629
aVFigured quite o\u2019er with burning meteors
p38630
aVLift up thy brow renownèd Salisbury
p38631
aVAnd with a great heart heave away this storm
p38632
aVCommend these waters to those baby eyes
p38633
aVThat never saw the giant world enraged
p38634
aVNor met with fortune other than at feasts
p38635
aVFull warm of blood of mirth of gossiping
p38636
aVCome come for thou shalt thrust thy hand as deep
p38637
aVInto the purse of rich prosperity
p38638
aVAs Louis himself So nobles shall you all
p38639
aVThat knit your sinews to the strength of mine
p38640
aVAnd even there methinks an angel spake
p38641
aVLook where the holy legate comes apace
p38642
aVTo give us warrant from the hand of God
p38643
aVAnd on our actions set the name of right
p38644
aVWith holy breath
p38645
aVHail noble prince of France
p38646
aVThe next is this King John hath reconciled
p38647
aVHimself to Rome his spirit is come in
p38648
aVThat so stood out against the holy Church
p38649
aVThe great metropolis and See of Rome
p38650
aVTherefore thy threat\u2019ning colors now wind up
p38651
aVAnd tame the savage spirit of wild war
p38652
aVThat like a lion fostered up at hand
p38653
aVIt may lie gently at the foot of peace
p38654
aVAnd be no further harmful than in show
p38655
aVYour Grace shall pardon me I will not back
p38656
aVI am too high-born to be propertied
p38657
aVTo be a secondary at control
p38658
aVOr useful servingman and instrument
p38659
aVTo any sovereign state throughout the world
p38660
aVYour breath first kindled the dead coal of wars
p38661
aVBetween this chastised kingdom and myself
p38662
aVAnd brought in matter that should feed this fire
p38663
aVAnd now \u2019tis far too huge to be blown out
p38664
aVWith that same weak wind which enkindled it
p38665
aVYou taught me how to know the face of right
p38666
aVAcquainted me with interest to this land
p38667
aVYea thrust this enterprise into my heart
p38668
aVAnd come you now to tell me John hath made
p38669
aVHis peace with Rome What is that peace to me
p38670
aVI by the honor of my marriage bed
p38671
aVAfter young Arthur claim this land for mine
p38672
aVAnd now it is half conquered must I back
p38673
aVBecause that John hath made his peace with Rome
p38674
aVAm I Rome\u2019s slave What penny hath Rome borne
p38675
aVWhat men provided What munition sent
p38676
aVTo underprop this action Is \u2019t not I
p38677
aVThat undergo this charge Who else but I
p38678
aVAnd such as to my claim are liable
p38679
aVSweat in this business and maintain this war
p38680
aVHave I not heard these islanders shout out
p38681
aVVive le Roi as I have banked their towns
p38682
aVHave I not here the best cards for the game
p38683
aVTo win this easy match played for a crown
p38684
aVAnd shall I now give o\u2019er the yielded set
p38685
aVNo no on my soul it never shall be said
p38686
aVYou look but on the outside of this work
p38687
aVOutside or inside I will not return
p38688
aVTill my attempt so much be glorified
p38689
aVAs to my ample hope was promisèd
p38690
aVBefore I drew this gallant head of war
p38691
aVAnd culled these fiery spirits from the world
p38692
aVTo outlook conquest and to win renown
p38693
aVEven in the jaws of danger and of death
p38694
aVWhat lusty trumpet thus doth summon us
p38695
aVAccording to the fair play of the world
p38696
aVLet me have audience I am sent to speak
p38697
aVMy holy lord of Milan from the King
p38698
aVI come to learn how you have dealt for him
p38699
aVAnd as you answer I do know the scope
p38700
aVAnd warrant limited unto my tongue
p38701
aVThe Dauphin is too willful-opposite
p38702
aVAnd will not temporize with my entreaties
p38703
aVHe flatly says he\u2019ll not lay down his arms
p38704
aVBy all the blood that ever fury breathed
p38705
aVThe youth says well Now hear our English king
p38706
aVFor thus his royalty doth speak in me
p38707
aVHe is prepared and reason too he should
p38708
aVThis apish and unmannerly approach
p38709
aVThis harnessed masque and unadvisèd revel
p38710
aVThis unheard sauciness and boyish troops
p38711
aVThe King doth smile at and is well prepared
p38712
aVTo whip this dwarfish war these pigmy arms
p38713
aVFrom out the circle of his territories
p38714
aVThat hand which had the strength even at your door
p38715
aVTo cudgel you and make you take the hatch
p38716
aVTo dive like buckets in concealèd wells
p38717
aVTo crouch in litter of your stable planks
p38718
aVTo lie like pawns locked up in chests and trunks
p38719
aVTo hug with swine to seek sweet safety out
p38720
aVIn vaults and prisons and to thrill and shake
p38721
aVEven at the crying of your nation\u2019s crow
p38722
aVThinking this voice an armèd Englishman
p38723
aVShall that victorious hand be feebled here
p38724
aVThat in your chambers gave you chastisement
p38725
aVNo Know the gallant monarch is in arms
p38726
aVAnd like an eagle o\u2019er his aerie towers
p38727
aVTo souse annoyance that comes near his nest
p38728
aVAnd you degenerate you ingrate revolts
p38729
aVYou bloody Neroes ripping up the womb
p38730
aVOf your dear mother England blush for shame
p38731
aVFor your own ladies and pale-visaged maids
p38732
aVLike Amazons come tripping after drums
p38733
aVTheir thimbles into armèd gauntlets change
p38734
aVTheir needles to lances and their gentle hearts
p38735
aVTo fierce and bloody inclination
p38736
aVThere end thy brave and turn thy face in peace
p38737
aVWe grant thou canst outscold us Fare thee well
p38738
aVWe hold our time too precious to be spent
p38739
aVWith such a brabbler
p38740
aVGive me leave to speak
p38741
aVNo I will speak
p38742
aVWe will attend to neither
p38743
aVStrike up the drums and let the tongue of war
p38744
aVPlead for our interest and our being here
p38745
aVIndeed your drums being beaten will cry out
p38746
aVAnd so shall you being beaten Do but start
p38747
aVAn echo with the clamor of thy drum
p38748
aVAnd even at hand a drum is ready braced
p38749
aVThat shall reverberate all as loud as thine
p38750
aVSound but another and another shall
p38751
aVAs loud as thine rattle the welkin\u2019s ear
p38752
aVAnd mock the deep-mouthed thunder For at hand
p38753
aVNot trusting to this halting legate here
p38754
aVWhom he hath used rather for sport than need
p38755
aVIs warlike John and in his forehead sits
p38756
aVA bare-ribbed Death whose office is this day
p38757
aVTo feast upon whole thousands of the French
p38758
aVStrike up our drums to find this danger out
p38759
aVAnd thou shalt find it dauphin do not doubt
p38760
aVHow goes the day with us O tell me Hubert
p38761
aVBadly I fear How fares your Majesty
p38762
aVThis fever that hath troubled me so long
p38763
aVLies heavy on me O my heart is sick
p38764
aVMy lord your valiant kinsman Faulconbridge
p38765
aVDesires your Majesty to leave the field
p38766
aVAnd send him word by me which way you go
p38767
aVTell him toward Swinstead to the abbey there
p38768
aVBe of good comfort for the great supply
p38769
aVThat was expected by the Dauphin here
p38770
aVAre wracked three nights ago on Goodwin Sands
p38771
aVThis news was brought to Richard but even now
p38772
aVThe French fight coldly and retire themselves
p38773
aVAy me this tyrant fever burns me up
p38774
aVAnd will not let me welcome this good news
p38775
aVSet on toward Swinstead To my litter straight
p38776
aVWeakness possesseth me and I am faint
p38777
aVI did not think the King so stored with friends
p38778
aVUp once again Put spirit in the French
p38779
aVIf they miscarry we miscarry too
p38780
aVThat misbegotten devil Faulconbridge
p38781
aVIn spite of spite alone upholds the day
p38782
aVThey say King John sore sick hath left the field
p38783
aVLead me to the revolts of England here
p38784
aVWhen we were happy we had other names
p38785
aVIt is the Count Melun
p38786
aVWounded to death
p38787
aVFly noble English you are bought and sold
p38788
aVUnthread the rude eye of rebellion
p38789
aVAnd welcome home again discarded faith
p38790
aVSeek out King John and fall before his feet
p38791
aVFor if the French be lords of this loud day
p38792
aVHe means to recompense the pains you take
p38793
aVBy cutting off your heads Thus hath he sworn
p38794
aVAnd I with him and many more with me
p38795
aVUpon the altar at Saint Edmundsbury
p38796
aVEven on that altar where we swore to you
p38797
aVDear amity and everlasting love
p38798
aVMay this be possible May this be true
p38799
aVHave I not hideous death within my view
p38800
aVRetaining but a quantity of life
p38801
aVWhich bleeds away even as a form of wax
p38802
aVResolveth from his figure \u2019gainst the fire
p38803
aVWhat in the world should make me now deceive
p38804
aVSince I must lose the use of all deceit
p38805
aVWhy should I then be false since it is true
p38806
aVThat I must die here and live hence by truth
p38807
aVI say again if Louis do win the day
p38808
aVHe is forsworn if e\u2019er those eyes of yours
p38809
aVBehold another daybreak in the East
p38810
aVBut even this night whose black contagious breath
p38811
aVAlready smokes about the burning crest
p38812
aVOf the old feeble and day-wearied sun
p38813
aVEven this ill night your breathing shall expire
p38814
aVPaying the fine of rated treachery
p38815
aVEven with a treacherous fine of all your lives
p38816
aVIf Louis by your assistance win the day
p38817
aVCommend me to one Hubert with your king
p38818
aVThe love of him and this respect besides
p38819
aVFor that my grandsire was an Englishman
p38820
aVAwakes my conscience to confess all this
p38821
aVIn lieu whereof I pray you bear me hence
p38822
aVFrom forth the noise and rumor of the field
p38823
aVWhere I may think the remnant of my thoughts
p38824
aVIn peace and part this body and my soul
p38825
aVWith contemplation and devout desires
p38826
aVWe do believe thee and beshrew my soul
p38827
aVBut I do love the favor and the form
p38828
aVOf this most fair occasion by the which
p38829
aVWe will untread the steps of damnèd flight
p38830
aVAnd like a bated and retirèd flood
p38831
aVLeaving our rankness and irregular course
p38832
aVStoop low within those bounds we have o\u2019erlooked
p38833
aVAnd calmly run on in obedience
p38834
aVEven to our ocean to our great King John
p38835
aVMy arm shall give thee help to bear thee hence
p38836
aVFor I do see the cruel pangs of death
p38837
aVRight in thine eye Away my friends New flight
p38838
aVAnd happy newness that intends old right
p38839
aVThe sun of heaven methought was loath to set
p38840
aVBut stayed and made the western welkin blush
p38841
aVWhen English measured backward their own ground
p38842
aVIn faint retire O bravely came we off
p38843
aVWhen with a volley of our needless shot
p38844
aVAfter such bloody toil we bid good night
p38845
aVAnd wound our tott\u2019ring colors clearly up
p38846
aVLast in the field and almost lords of it
p38847
aVWhere is my prince the Dauphin

aVAs this hath made me Who was he that said
p38856
aVKing John did fly an hour or two before
p38857
aVThe stumbling night did part our weary powers

aVWhoever spoke it it is true my lord

aVShow me the very wound of this ill news
p38887
aVI am no woman I\u2019ll not swoon at it
p38888
aVThe King I fear is poisoned by a monk
p38889
aVI left him almost speechless and broke out
p38890
aVTo acquaint you with this evil that you might
p38891
aVThe better arm you to the sudden time
p38892
aVThan if you had at leisure known of this

aVA monk I tell you a resolvèd villain
p38895
aVWhose bowels suddenly burst out The King
p38896
aVYet speaks and peradventure may recover
p38897
aVWho didst thou leave to tend his Majesty
p38898
aVWhy know you not The lords are all come back
p38899
aVAnd brought Prince Henry in their company
p38900
aVAt whose request the King hath pardoned them
p38901
aVAnd they are all about his Majesty
p38902
aVWithhold thine indignation mighty God

aVAnd tempt us not to bear above our power
p38904
aVI\u2019ll tell thee Hubert half my power this night
p38905
aVPassing these flats are taken by the tide
p38906
aVThese Lincoln Washes have devourèd them
p38907
aVMyself well mounted hardly have escaped
p38908
aVAway before Conduct me to the King
p38909
aVI doubt he will be dead or ere I come
p38910
aVIt is too late The life of all his blood
p38911
aVIs touched corruptibly and his pure brain
p38912
aVWhich some suppose the soul\u2019s frail dwelling-house
p38913
aVDoth by the idle comments that it makes
p38914
aVForetell the ending of mortality
p38915
aVHis Highness yet doth speak and holds belief
p38916
aVThat being brought into the open air
p38917
aVIt would allay the burning quality
p38918
aVOf that fell poison which assaileth him
p38919
aVLet him be brought into the orchard here
p38920
aVDoth he still rage
p38921
aVHe is more patient
p38922
aVThan when you left him Even now he sung
p38923
aVO vanity of sickness Fierce extremes
p38924
aVIn their continuance will not feel themselves
p38925
aVDeath having preyed upon the outward parts
p38926
aVLeaves them invisible and his siege is now
p38927
aVAgainst the mind the which he pricks and wounds
p38928
aVWith many legions of strange fantasies
p38929
aVWhich in their throng and press to that last hold
p38930
aVConfound themselves \u2019Tis strange that Death should sing
p38931
aVI am the cygnet to this pale faint swan
p38932
aVWho chants a doleful hymn to his own death
p38933
aVAnd from the organ-pipe of frailty sings
p38934
aVHis soul and body to their lasting rest
p38935
aVBe of good comfort prince for you are born
p38936
aVTo set a form upon that indigest
p38937
aVWhich he hath left so shapeless and so rude
p38938
aVAy marry now my soul hath elbow-room
p38939
aVIt would not out at windows nor at doors
p38940
aVThere is so hot a summer in my bosom
p38941
aVThat all my bowels crumble up to dust
p38942
aVI am a scribbled form drawn with a pen
p38943
aVUpon a parchment and against this fire
p38944
aVDo I shrink up
p38945
aVHow fares your Majesty
p38946
aVPoisoned ill fare dead forsook cast off
p38947
aVAnd none of you will bid the winter come
p38948
aVTo thrust his icy fingers in my maw
p38949
aVNor let my kingdom\u2019s rivers take their course
p38950
aVThrough my burned bosom nor entreat the North
p38951
aVTo make his bleak winds kiss my parchèd lips
p38952
aVAnd comfort me with cold I do not ask you much
p38953
aVI beg cold comfort and you are so strait
p38954
aVAnd so ingrateful you deny me that
p38955
aVO that there were some virtue in my tears
p38956
aVThat might relieve you
p38957
aVThe salt in them is hot
p38958
aVWithin me is a hell and there the poison
p38959
aVIs as a fiend confined to tyrannize
p38960
aVOn unreprievable condemnèd blood
p38961
aVO I am scalded with my violent motion
p38962
aVAnd spleen of speed to see your Majesty
p38963
aVO cousin thou art come to set mine eye
p38964
aVThe tackle of my heart is cracked and burnt
p38965
aVAnd all the shrouds wherewith my life should sail
p38966
aVAre turnèd to one thread one little hair
p38967
aVMy heart hath one poor string to stay it by
p38968
aVWhich holds but till thy news be utterèd
p38969
aVAnd then all this thou seest is but a clod
p38970
aVAnd module of confounded royalty
p38971
aVThe Dauphin is preparing hitherward
p38972
aVWhere God He knows how we shall answer him
p38973
aVFor in a night the best part of my power
p38974
aVAs I upon advantage did remove
p38975
aVWere in the Washes all unwarily
p38976
aVDevourèd by the unexpected flood
p38977
aVYou breathe these dead news in as dead an ear
p38978
aVMy liege My lord But now a king now thus
p38979
aVEven so must I run on and even so stop
p38980
aVWhat surety of the world what hope what stay
p38981
aVWhen this was now a king and now is clay
p38982
aVArt thou gone so I do but stay behind
p38983
aVTo do the office for thee of revenge
p38984
aVAnd then my soul shall wait on thee to heaven
p38985
aVAs it on Earth hath been thy servant still
p38986
aVNow now you stars that move in your right spheres
p38987
aVWhere be your powers Show now your mended faiths
p38988
aVAnd instantly return with me again
p38989
aVTo push destruction and perpetual shame
p38990
aVOut of the weak door of our fainting land
p38991
aVStraight let us seek or straight we shall be sought
p38992
aVThe Dauphin rages at our very heels
p38993
aVIt seems you know not then so much as we
p38994
aVThe Cardinal Pandulph is within at rest
p38995
aVWho half an hour since came from the Dauphin
p38996
aVAnd brings from him such offers of our peace
p38997
aVAs we with honor and respect may take
p38998
aVWith purpose presently to leave this war
p38999
aVHe will the rather do it when he sees
p39000
aVOurselves well-sinewèd to our defense
p39001
aVNay \u2019tis in a manner done already
p39002
aVFor many carriages he hath dispatched
p39003
aVTo the sea-side and put his cause and quarrel
p39004
aVTo the disposing of the Cardinal
p39005
aVWith whom yourself myself and other lords
p39006
aVIf you think meet this afternoon will post
p39007
aVTo consummate this business happily
p39008
aVLet it be so And you my noble prince
p39009
aVWith other princes that may best be spared
p39010
aVShall wait upon your father\u2019s funeral
p39011
aVAt Worcester must his body be interred
p39012
aVFor so he willed it
p39013
aVThither shall it then
p39014
aVAnd happily may your sweet self put on
p39015
aVThe lineal state and glory of the land
p39016
aVTo whom with all submission on my knee
p39017
aVI do bequeath my faithful services
p39018
aVAnd true subjection everlastingly
p39019
aVAnd the like tender of our love we make
p39020
aVTo rest without a spot forevermore
p39021
aVI have a kind soul that would give you thanks
p39022
aVAnd knows not how to do it but with tears
p39023
aVO let us pay the time but needful woe
p39024
aVSince it hath been beforehand with our griefs
p39025
aVThis England never did nor never shall
p39026
aVLie at the proud foot of a conqueror
p39027
aVBut when it first did help to wound itself
p39028
aVNow these her princes are come home again
p39029
aVCome the three corners of the world in arms
p39030
aVAnd we shall shock them Naught shall make us rue
p39031
aVIf England to itself do rest but true
p39032
aVLet fame that all hunt after in their lives
p39033
aVLive registered upon our brazen tombs
p39034
aVAnd then grace us in the disgrace of death
p39035
aVWhen spite of cormorant devouring time
p39036
aVTh\u2019 endeavor of this present breath may buy
p39037
aVThat honor which shall bate his scythe\u2019s keen edge
p39038
aVAnd make us heirs of all eternity
p39039
aVTherefore brave conquerors for so you are
p39040
aVThat war against your own affections
p39041
aVAnd the huge army of the world\u2019s desires
p39042
aVOur late edict shall strongly stand in force
p39043
aVNavarre shall be the wonder of the world
p39044
aVOur court shall be a little academe
p39045
aVStill and contemplative in living art
p39046
aVYou three Berowne Dumaine and Longaville
p39047
aVHave sworn for three years\u2019 term to live with me
p39048
aVMy fellow scholars and to keep those statutes
p39049
aVThat are recorded in this schedule here
p39050
aVYour oaths are passed and now subscribe your names
p39051
aVThat his own hand may strike his honor down
p39052
aVThat violates the smallest branch herein
p39053
aVIf you are armed to do as sworn to do
p39054
aVSubscribe to your deep oaths and keep it too
p39055
aVI am resolved \u2019Tis but a three years\u2019 fast
p39056
aVThe mind shall banquet though the body pine
p39057
aVFat paunches have lean pates and dainty bits
p39058
aVMake rich the ribs but bankrout quite the wits
p39059
aVMy loving lord Dumaine is mortified
p39060
aVThe grosser manner of these world\u2019s delights
p39061
aVHe throws upon the gross world\u2019s baser slaves
p39062
aVTo love to wealth to pomp I pine and die
p39063
aVWith all these living in philosophy
p39064
aVI can but say their protestation over
p39065
aVSo much dear liege I have already sworn
p39066
aVThat is to live and study here three years
p39067
aVBut there are other strict observances
p39068
aVAs not to see a woman in that term
p39069
aVWhich I hope well is not enrollèd there
p39070
aVAnd one day in a week to touch no food
p39071
aVAnd but one meal on every day besides
p39072
aVThe which I hope is not enrollèd there
p39073
aVAnd then to sleep but three hours in the night
p39074
aVAnd not be seen to wink of all the day
p39075
aVWhen I was wont to think no harm all night
p39076
aVAnd make a dark night too of half the day
p39077
aVWhich I hope well is not enrollèd there
p39078
aVO these are barren tasks too hard to keep
p39079
aVNot to see ladies study fast not sleep
p39080
aVYour oath is passed to pass away from these
p39081
aVLet me say no my liege an if you please
p39082
aVI only swore to study with your Grace
p39083
aVAnd stay here in your court for three years\u2019 space
p39084
aVYou swore to that Berowne and to the rest
p39085
aVBy yea and nay sir Then I swore in jest
p39086
aVWhat is the end of study let me know
p39087
aVWhy that to know which else we should not know
p39088
aVThings hid and barred you mean from common sense
p39089
aVAy that is study\u2019s godlike recompense
p39090
aVCome on then I will swear to study so
p39091
aVTo know the thing I am forbid to know
p39092
aVAs thus to study where I well may dine
p39093
aVWhen I to feast expressly am forbid
p39094
aVOr study where to meet some mistress fine
p39095
aVWhen mistresses from common sense are hid
p39096
aVOr having sworn too hard-a-keeping oath
p39097
aVStudy to break it and not break my troth
p39098
aVIf study\u2019s gain be thus and this be so
p39099
aVStudy knows that which yet it doth not know
p39100
aVSwear me to this and I will ne\u2019er say no
p39101
aVThese be the stops that hinder study quite
p39102
aVAnd train our intellects to vain delight
p39103
aVWhy all delights are vain and that most vain
p39104
aVWhich with pain purchased doth inherit pain
p39105
aVAs painfully to pore upon a book
p39106
aVTo seek the light of truth while truth the while
p39107
aVDoth falsely blind the eyesight of his look
p39108
aVLight seeking light doth light of light beguile
p39109
aVSo ere you find where light in darkness lies
p39110
aVYour light grows dark by losing of your eyes
p39111
aVStudy me how to please the eye indeed
p39112
aVBy fixing it upon a fairer eye
p39113
aVWho dazzling so that eye shall be his heed
p39114
aVAnd give him light that it was blinded by
p39115
aVStudy is like the heaven\u2019s glorious sun
p39116
aVThat will not be deep-searched with saucy looks
p39117
aVSmall have continual plodders ever won
p39118
aVSave base authority from others\u2019 books
p39119
aVThese earthly godfathers of heaven\u2019s lights
p39120
aVThat give a name to every fixèd star
p39121
aVHave no more profit of their shining nights
p39122
aVThan those that walk and wot not what they are
p39123
aVToo much to know is to know naught but fame
p39124
aVAnd every godfather can give a name
p39125
aVHow well he\u2019s read to reason against reading
p39126
aVProceeded well to stop all good proceeding
p39127
aVHe weeds the corn and still lets grow the weeding
p39128
aVThe spring is near when green geese are a-breeding
p39129
aVHow follows that
p39130
aVFit in his place and time
p39131
aVIn reason nothing
p39132
aVSomething then in rhyme
p39133
aVBerowne is like an envious sneaping frost
p39134
aVThat bites the firstborn infants of the spring
p39135
aVWell say I am Why should proud summer boast
p39136
aVBefore the birds have any cause to sing
p39137
aVWhy should I joy in any abortive birth
p39138
aVAt Christmas I no more desire a rose
p39139
aVThan wish a snow in May\u2019s new-fangled shows
p39140
aVBut like of each thing that in season grows
p39141
aVSo you to study now it is too late
p39142
aVClimb o\u2019er the house to unlock the little gate
p39143
aVWell sit you out Go home Berowne Adieu
p39144
aVNo my good lord I have sworn to stay with you
p39145
aVAnd though I have for barbarism spoke more
p39146
aVThan for that angel knowledge you can say
p39147
aVYet confident I\u2019ll keep what I have sworn
p39148
aVAnd bide the penance of each three years\u2019 day
p39149
aVGive me the paper Let me read the same
p39150
aVAnd to the strictest decrees I\u2019ll write my name
p39151
aVHow well this yielding rescues thee from shame
p39152
aVTo fright them hence with that dread penalty
p39153
aVA dangerous law against gentility
p39154
aVThis article my liege yourself must break
p39155
aVFor well you know here comes in embassy
p39156
aVThe French king\u2019s daughter with yourself to speak
p39157
aVA maid of grace and complete majesty
p39158
aVAbout surrender up of Aquitaine
p39159
aVTo her decrepit sick and bedrid father
p39160
aVTherefore this article is made in vain
p39161
aVOr vainly comes th\u2019 admirèd princess hither
p39162
aVWhat say you lords Why this was quite forgot
p39163
aVSo study evermore is overshot
p39164
aVWhile it doth study to have what it would
p39165
aVIt doth forget to do the thing it should
p39166
aVAnd when it hath the thing it hunteth most
p39167
aV\u2019Tis won as towns with fire so won so lost
p39168
aVWe must of force dispense with this decree
p39169
aVShe must lie here on mere necessity
p39170
aVNecessity will make us all forsworn
p39171
aVThree thousand times within this three years\u2019 space
p39172
aVFor every man with his affects is born
p39173
aVNot by might mastered but by special grace
p39174
aVIf I break faith this word shall speak for me
p39175
aVI am forsworn on mere necessity
p39176
aVSo to the laws at large I write my name
p39177
aVAnd he that breaks them in the least degree
p39178
aVStands in attainder of eternal shame
p39179
aVSuggestions are to other as to me
p39180
aVBut I believe although I seem so loath
p39181
aVI am the last that will last keep his oath
p39182
aVBut is there no quick recreation granted
p39183
aVAy that there is Our court you know is haunted
p39184
aVWith a refinèd traveler of Spain
p39185
aVA man in all the world\u2019s new fashion planted
p39186
aVThat hath a mint of phrases in his brain
p39187
aVOne who the music of his own vain tongue
p39188
aVDoth ravish like enchanting harmony
p39189
aVA man of compliments whom right and wrong
p39190
aVHave chose as umpire of their mutiny
p39191
aVThis child of fancy that Armado hight
p39192
aVFor interim to our studies shall relate
p39193
aVIn high-born words the worth of many a knight
p39194
aVFrom tawny Spain lost in the world\u2019s debate
p39195
aVHow you delight my lords I know not I
p39196
aVBut I protest I love to hear him lie
p39197
aVAnd I will use him for my minstrelsy
p39198
aVArmado is a most illustrious wight
p39199
aVA man of fire-new words fashion\u2019s own knight
p39200
aVCostard the swain and he shall be our sport
p39201
aVAnd so to study three years is but short
p39202
aVMy Lord Berowne see him delivered o\u2019er
p39203
aVAnd go we lords to put in practice that
p39204
aVWhich each to other hath so strongly sworn
p39205
aVI\u2019ll lay my head to any goodman\u2019s hat
p39206
aVThese oaths and laws will prove an idle scorn

aVSirrah come on
p39208
aVIf she be made of white and red
p39209
aVHer faults will ne\u2019er be known
p39210
aVFor blushing cheeks by faults are bred
p39211
aVAnd fears by pale white shown
p39212
aVThen if she fear or be to blame
p39213
aVBy this you shall not know
p39214
aVFor still her cheeks possess the same
p39215
aVWhich native she doth owe
p39216
aVNow madam summon up your dearest spirits
p39217
aVConsider who the King your father sends
p39218
aVTo whom he sends and what\u2019s his embassy
p39219
aVYourself held precious in the world\u2019s esteem
p39220
aVTo parley with the sole inheritor
p39221
aVOf all perfections that a man may owe
p39222
aVMatchless Navarre the plea of no less weight
p39223
aVThan Aquitaine a dowry for a queen
p39224
aVBe now as prodigal of all dear grace
p39225
aVAs nature was in making graces dear
p39226
aVWhen she did starve the general world besides
p39227
aVAnd prodigally gave them all to you
p39228
aVGood Lord Boyet my beauty though but mean
p39229
aVNeeds not the painted flourish of your praise
p39230
aVBeauty is bought by judgment of the eye
p39231
aVNot uttered by base sale of chapmen\u2019s tongues
p39232
aVI am less proud to hear you tell my worth
p39233
aVThan you much willing to be counted wise
p39234
aVIn spending your wit in the praise of mine
p39235
aVBut now to task the tasker good Boyet
p39236
aVYou are not ignorant all-telling fame

aVDoth noise abroad Navarre hath made a vow
p39238
aVTill painful study shall outwear three years
p39239
aVNo woman may approach his silent court
p39240
aVTherefore to \u2019s seemeth it a needful course
p39241
aVBefore we enter his forbidden gates
p39242
aVTo know his pleasure and in that behalf
p39243
aVBold of your worthiness we single you
p39244

aVA man of sovereign parts he is esteemed

aVWell fitted in arts glorious in arms

aVNothing becomes him ill that he would well
p39263
aVThe only soil of his fair virtue\u2019s gloss
p39264
aVIf virtue\u2019s gloss will stain with any soil
p39265
aVIs a sharp wit matched with too blunt a will

aVIt should none spare that come within his power
p39268
aVSome merry mocking lord belike Is \u2019t so

aVSuch short-lived wits do wither as they grow

p39273
aVOf all that virtue love for virtue loved

p39276
aVAnd shape to win grace though he had no wit
p39277
aVI saw him at the Duke Alanson\u2019s once
p39278
aVAnd much too little of that good I saw
p39279
aVIs my report to his great worthiness
p39280
aVAnother of these students at that time
p39281
aVWas there with him if I have heard a truth
p39282
aVBerowne they call him but a merrier man
p39283
aVWithin the limit of becoming mirth
p39284
aVI never spent an hour\u2019s talk withal
p39285
aVHis eye begets occasion for his wit
p39286
aVFor every object that the one doth catch
p39287
aVThe other turns to a mirth-moving jest
p39288
aVWhich his fair tongue conceit\u2019s expositor
p39289
aVDelivers in such apt and gracious words
p39290
aVThat agèd ears play truant at his tales
p39291
aVAnd younger hearings are quite ravishèd
p39292
aVSo sweet and voluble is his discourse
p39293
aVGod bless my ladies are they all in love
p39294
aVThat every one her own hath garnishèd
p39295
aVWith such bedecking ornaments of praise
p39296
aVHere comes Boyet
p39297
aVNow what admittance lord
p39298
aVNavarre had notice of your fair approach

aVAnd he and his competitors in oath
p39300
aVWere all addressed to meet you gentle lady
p39301
aVBefore I came Marry thus much I have learned
p39302
aVHe rather means to lodge you in the field
p39303
aVLike one that comes here to besiege his court
p39304
aVThan seek a dispensation for his oath
p39305
aVTo let you enter his unpeopled house
p39306
aVHere comes Navarre

p39349
aVOne part of Aquitaine is bound to us

aVIf then the King your father will restore

aVBut that one half which is unsatisfied

aVWe will give up our right in Aquitaine
p39354
aVAnd hold fair friendship with his Majesty

aVOn payment of a hundred thousand crowns
p39359
aVTo have his title live in Aquitaine
p39360

aVAnd wrong the reputation of your name
p39369
aVIn so unseeming to confess receipt
p39370
aVOf that which hath so faithfully been paid
p39371
aVI do protest I never heard of it
p39372
aVAnd if you prove it I\u2019ll repay it back
p39373
aVOr yield up Aquitaine
p39374
aVWe arrest your word
p39375
aVBoyet you can produce acquittances
p39376
aVFor such a sum from special officers
p39377
aVOf Charles his father

p39399
aVA woman sometimes an you saw her in the light
p39400
aVPerchance light in the light I desire her name
p39401
aVShe hath but one for herself to desire that were a shame
p39402
aVThat last is Berowne the merry madcap lord
p39403
aVNot a word with him but a jest
p39404
aVAnd every jest but a word

p39422
aVWith what
p39423
aVWith that which we lovers entitle affected
p39424
aVYour reason
p39425
aVWhy all his behaviors did make their retire
p39426
aVTo the court of his eye peeping thorough desire
p39427
aVHis heart like an agate with your print impressed
p39428
aVProud with his form in his eye pride expressed
p39429
aVHis tongue all impatient to speak and not see
p39430
aVDid stumble with haste in his eyesight to be
p39431
aVAll senses to that sense did make their repair
p39432
aVTo feel only looking on fairest of fair
p39433
aVMethought all his senses were locked in his eye
p39434
aVAs jewels in crystal for some prince to buy

aVCome to our pavilion Boyet is disposed
p39442
aVBut to speak that in words which his eye hath disclosed
p39443
aVI only have made a mouth of his eye
p39444
aVBy adding a tongue which I know will not lie
p39445
aVThou art an old lovemonger and speakest skillfully
p39446
aVHe is Cupid\u2019s grandfather and learns news of him
p39447
aVThen was Venus like her mother for her father is but grim

aVMy love her mistress is a gracious moon
p39905
aVShe an attending star scarce seen a light
p39906
aVMy eyes are then no eyes nor I Berowne
p39907
aVO but for my love day would turn to night
p39908
aVOf all complexions the culled sovereignty
p39909
aVDo meet as at a fair in her fair cheek
p39910
aVWhere several worthies make one dignity
p39911
aVWhere nothing wants that want itself doth seek
p39912
aVLend me the flourish of all gentle tongues
p39913
aVFie painted rhetoric O she needs it not
p39914
aVTo things of sale a seller\u2019s praise belongs
p39915
aVShe passes praise Then praise too short doth blot
p39916
aVA withered hermit fivescore winters worn
p39917
aVMight shake off fifty looking in her eye
p39918
aVBeauty doth varnish age as if newborn
p39919
aVAnd gives the crutch the cradle\u2019s infancy
p39920
aVO \u2019tis the sun that maketh all things shine
p39921
aVBy heaven thy love is black as ebony
p39922
aVIs ebony like her O word divine
p39923
aVA wife of such wood were felicity
p39924
aVO who can give an oath Where is a book
p39925
aVThat I may swear beauty doth beauty lack
p39926
aVIf that she learn not of her eye to look
p39927
aVNo face is fair that is not full so black
p39928
aVO paradox Black is the badge of hell
p39929
aVThe hue of dungeons and the school of night
p39930
aVAnd beauty\u2019s crest becomes the heavens well
p39931
aVDevils soonest tempt resembling spirits of light
p39932
aVO if in black my lady\u2019s brows be decked
p39933
aVIt mourns that painting and usurping hair
p39934
aVShould ravish doters with a false aspect
p39935
aVAnd therefore is she born to make black fair
p39936
aVHer favor turns the fashion of the days
p39937
aVFor native blood is counted painting now
p39938
aVAnd therefore red that would avoid dispraise
p39939
aVPaints itself black to imitate her brow
p39940
aVTo look like her are chimney-sweepers black
p39941
aVAnd since her time are colliers counted bright
p39942
aVAnd Ethiopes of their sweet complexion crack

aVDark needs no candles now for dark is light
p39944
aVYour mistresses dare never come in rain

aVFor fear their colors should be washed away
p39946
aV\u2019Twere good yours did for sir to tell you plain
p39947
aVI\u2019ll find a fairer face not washed today

aVNo devil will fright thee then so much as she

aVI never knew man hold vile stuff so dear
p39951
aVLook here\u2019s thy love my foot and her face see
p39952
aVO if the streets were pavèd with thine eyes
p39953
aVHer feet were much too dainty for such tread
p39954
aVO vile Then as she goes what upward lies
p39955
aVThe street should see as she walked overhead
p39956
aVBut what of this Are we not all in love
p39957
aVNothing so sure and thereby all forsworn
p39958
aVThen leave this chat and good Berowne now prove
p39959
aVOur loving lawful and our faith not torn
p39960
aVAy marry there some flattery for this evil
p39961
aVO some authority how to proceed
p39962
aVSome tricks some quillets how to cheat the devil
p39963
aVSome salve for perjury
p39964
aVO \u2019tis more than need
p39965
aVHave at you then affection\u2019s men-at-arms
p39966
aVO we have made a vow to study lords
p39967
aVAnd in that vow we have forsworn our books
p39968
aVFor when would you my liege or you or you
p39969
aVIn leaden contemplation have found out
p39970
aVSuch fiery numbers as the prompting eyes
p39971
aVOf beauty\u2019s tutors have enriched you with
p39972
aVOther slow arts entirely keep the brain
p39973
aVAnd therefore finding barren practicers
p39974
aVScarce show a harvest of their heavy toil
p39975
aVBut love first learnèd in a lady\u2019s eyes
p39976
aVLives not alone immurèd in the brain
p39977
aVBut with the motion of all elements
p39978
aVCourses as swift as thought in every power
p39979
aVAnd gives to every power a double power
p39980
aVAbove their functions and their offices
p39981
aVIt adds a precious seeing to the eye
p39982
aVA lover\u2019s eyes will gaze an eagle blind
p39983
aVA lover\u2019s ear will hear the lowest sound
p39984
aVWhen the suspicious head of theft is stopped
p39985
aVLove\u2019s feeling is more soft and sensible
p39986
aVThan are the tender horns of cockled snails
p39987
aVLove\u2019s tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste
p39988
aVFor valor is not love a Hercules
p39989
aVStill climbing trees in the Hesperides
p39990
aVSubtle as Sphinx as sweet and musical
p39991
aVAs bright Apollo\u2019s lute strung with his hair
p39992
aVAnd when love speaks the voice of all the gods
p39993
aVMake heaven drowsy with the harmony
p39994
aVNever durst poet touch a pen to write
p39995
aVUntil his ink were tempered with love\u2019s sighs
p39996
aVO then his lines would ravish savage ears
p39997
aVAnd plant in tyrants mild humility
p39998
aVFrom women\u2019s eyes this doctrine I derive
p39999
aVThey sparkle still the right Promethean fire
p40000
aVThey are the books the arts the academes
p40001
aVThat show contain and nourish all the world
p40002
aVElse none at all in ought proves excellent
p40003
aVThen fools you were these women to forswear
p40004
aVOr keeping what is sworn you will prove fools
p40005
aVFor wisdom\u2019s sake a word that all men love
p40006
aVOr for love\u2019s sake a word that loves all men
p40007
aVOr for men\u2019s sake the authors of these women
p40008
aVOr women\u2019s sake by whom we men are men
p40009
aVLet us once lose our oaths to find ourselves
p40010
aVOr else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths
p40011
aVIt is religion to be thus forsworn
p40012
aVFor charity itself fulfills the law
p40013
aVAnd who can sever love from charity
p40014
aVSaint Cupid then and soldiers to the field
p40015
aVAdvance your standards and upon them lords
p40016
aVPell-mell down with them But be first advised

aVIn conflict that you get the sun of them
p40018
aVNow to plain dealing Lay these glozes by
p40019
aVShall we resolve to woo these girls of France
p40020
aVAnd win them too Therefore let us devise
p40021
aVSome entertainment for them in their tents
p40022
aVFirst from the park let us conduct them thither
p40023
aVThen homeward every man attach the hand
p40024
aVOf his fair mistress In the afternoon
p40025
aVWe will with some strange pastime solace them
p40026
aVSuch as the shortness of the time can shape
p40027
aVFor revels dances masques and merry hours
p40028
aVForerun fair love strewing her way with flowers
p40029
aVAway away No time shall be omitted
p40030
aVThat will betime and may by us be fitted
p40031
aVAllons Allons Sowed cockle reaped no corn
p40032
aVAnd justice always whirls in equal measure
p40033
aVLight wenches may prove plagues to men forsworn
p40034
aVIf so our copper buys no better treasure
p40035
aVSweethearts we shall be rich ere we depart
p40036
aVIf fairings come thus plentifully in
p40037
aVA lady walled about with diamonds
p40038
aVLook you what I have from the loving king
p40039
aVMadam came nothing else along with that
p40040
aVNothing but this Yes as much love in rhyme
p40041
aVAs would be crammed up in a sheet of paper
p40042
aVWrit o\u2019 both sides the leaf margent and all
p40043
aVThat he was fain to seal on Cupid\u2019s name
p40044
aVThat was the way to make his godhead wax
p40045
aVFor he hath been five thousand year a boy
p40046
aVAy and a shrewd unhappy gallows too
p40047
aVYou\u2019ll ne\u2019er be friends with him He killed your sister
p40048
aVHe made her melancholy sad and heavy
p40049
aVAnd so she died Had she been light like you
p40050
aVOf such a merry nimble stirring spirit
p40051
aVShe might ha\u2019 been a grandam ere she died
p40052
aVAnd so may you for a light heart lives long
p40053
aVWhat\u2019s your dark meaning mouse of this light word
p40054
aVA light condition in a beauty dark
p40055
aVWe need more light to find your meaning out
p40056
aVYou\u2019ll mar the light by taking it in snuff
p40057
aVTherefore I\u2019ll darkly end the argument
p40058
aVLook what you do you do it still i\u2019 th\u2019 dark
p40059
aVSo do not you for you are a light wench
p40060
aVIndeed I weigh not you and therefore light

aVYou weigh me not O that\u2019s you care not for me
p40062
aVGreat reason for past care is still past cure
p40063
aVWell bandied both a set of wit well played
p40064
aVBut Rosaline you have a favor too
p40065
aVWho sent it And what is it
p40066
aVI would you knew

aVI were the fairest goddess on the ground
p40072
aVI am compared to twenty thousand fairs
p40073
aVO he hath drawn my picture in his letter
p40074
aVAnything like
p40075
aVMuch in the letters nothing in the praise
p40076
aVBeauteous as ink a good conclusion

aVA huge translation of hypocrisy
p40089
aVVilely compiled profound simplicity
p40090
aVThis and these pearls to me sent Longaville
p40091
aVThe letter is too long by half a mile
p40092
aVI think no less Dost thou not wish in heart
p40093
aVThe chain were longer and the letter short
p40094
aVAy or I would these hands might never part
p40095
aVWe are wise girls to mock our lovers so
p40096
aVThey are worse fools to purchase mocking so
p40097
aVThat same Berowne I\u2019ll torture ere I go
p40098
aVO that I knew he were but in by th\u2019 week
p40099
aVHow I would make him fawn and beg and seek
p40100
aVAnd wait the season and observe the times
p40101
aVAnd spend his prodigal wits in bootless rhymes
p40102
aVAnd shape his service wholly to my hests
p40103
aVAnd make him proud to make me proud that jests
p40104
aVSo pair-taunt-like would I o\u2019ersway his state

aVThat he should be my fool and I his fate

p40109
aVAnd wit\u2019s own grace to grace a learnèd fool
p40110
aVThe blood of youth burns not with such excess
p40111
aVAs gravity\u2019s revolt to wantonness
p40112
aVFolly in fools bears not so strong a note
p40113
aVAs fool\u2019ry in the wise when wit doth dote
p40114
aVSince all the power thereof it doth apply
p40115
aVTo prove by wit worth in simplicity
p40116
aVHere comes Boyet and mirth is in his face

aVArmèd in arguments You\u2019ll be surprised

aVMuster your wits stand in your own defense
p40124
aVOr hide your heads like cowards and fly hence
p40125
aVSaint Denis to Saint Cupid What are they
p40126
aVThat charge their breath against us Say scout say
p40127
aVUnder the cool shade of a sycamore
p40128
aVI thought to close mine eyes some half an hour
p40129
aVWhen lo to interrupt my purposed rest
p40130
aVToward that shade I might behold addressed
p40131
aVThe King and his companions Warily
p40132
aVI stole into a neighbor thicket by
p40133
aVAnd overheard what you shall overhear
p40134
aVThat by and by disguised they will be here
p40135
aVTheir herald is a pretty knavish page
p40136
aVThat well by heart hath conned his embassage
p40137
aVAction and accent did they teach him there
p40138
aVThus must thou speak and thus thy body bear
p40139
aVAnd ever and anon they made a doubt
p40140
aVPresence majestical would put him out
p40141
aVFor quoth the King an angel shalt thou see
p40142
aVYet fear not thou but speak audaciously
p40143
aVThe boy replied An angel is not evil
p40144
aVI should have feared her had she been a devil
p40145
aVWith that all laughed and clapped him on the shoulder
p40146
aVMaking the bold wag by their praises bolder
p40147
aVOne rubbed his elbow thus and fleered and swore
p40148
aVA better speech was never spoke before
p40149
aVAnother with his finger and his thumb
p40150
aVCried Via We will do \u2019t come what will come
p40151
aVThe third he capered and cried All goes well
p40152
aVThe fourth turned on the toe and down he fell
p40153
aVWith that they all did tumble on the ground
p40154
aVWith such a zealous laughter so profound
p40155
aVThat in this spleen ridiculous appears
p40156
aVTo check their folly passion\u2019s solemn tears
p40157
aVBut what but what Come they to visit us
p40158
aVThey do they do and are appareled thus
p40159
aVLike Muscovites or Russians as I guess
p40160
aVTheir purpose is to parley to court and dance
p40161
aVAnd every one his love-feat will advance
p40162
aVUnto his several mistress which they\u2019ll know
p40163
aVBy favors several which they did bestow
p40164
aVAnd will they so The gallants shall be tasked
p40165
aVFor ladies we will every one be masked
p40166
aVAnd not a man of them shall have the grace
p40167
aVDespite of suit to see a lady\u2019s face
p40168
aVHold Rosaline this favor thou shalt wear
p40169
aVAnd then the King will court thee for his dear
p40170
aVHold take thou this my sweet and give me thine
p40171
aVSo shall Berowne take me for Rosaline
p40172
aVAnd change you favors too So shall your loves
p40173
aVWoo contrary deceived by these removes
p40174
aVCome on then wear the favors most in sight
p40175
aVBut in this changing what is your intent
p40176
aVThe effect of my intent is to cross theirs
p40177
aVThey do it but in mockery merriment
p40178
aVAnd mock for mock is only my intent
p40179
aVTheir several counsels they unbosom shall
p40180
aVTo loves mistook and so be mocked withal
p40181
aVUpon the next occasion that we meet
p40182
aVWith visages displayed to talk and greet
p40183
aVBut shall we dance if they desire us to \u2019t
p40184
aVNo to the death we will not move a foot
p40185
aVNor to their penned speech render we no grace
p40186
aVBut while \u2019tis spoke each turn away her face
p40187
aVWhy that contempt will kill the speaker\u2019s heart
p40188
aVAnd quite divorce his memory from his part
p40189
aVTherefore I do it and I make no doubt
p40190
aVThe rest will ne\u2019er come in if he be out
p40191
aVThere\u2019s no such sport as sport by sport o\u2019erthrown
p40192
aVTo make theirs ours and ours none but our own
p40193
aVSo shall we stay mocking intended game
p40194
aVAnd they well mocked depart away with shame
p40195
aVThe trumpet sounds Be masked the maskers come
p40196
aVAll hail the richest beauties on the Earth
p40197
aVBeauties no richer than rich taffeta
p40198
aVA holy parcel of the fairest dames
p40199
aVThat ever turned their backs to mortal views

aVThat ever turned their eyes to mortal views

aVTrue out indeed
p40203
aVOut of your favors heavenly spirits vouchsafe
p40204
aVNot to behold

aVOnce to behold rogue
p40206
aVOnce to behold with your sun-beamèd eyes
p40207
aVWith your sun-beamèd eyes
p40208
aVThey will not answer to that epithet
p40209
aVYou were best call it daughter-beamèd eyes
p40210
aVThey do not mark me and that brings me out
p40211
aVIs this your perfectness Begone you rogue
p40212
aVWhat would these strangers Know their minds Boyet
p40213
aVIf they do speak our language \u2019tis our will
p40214
aVThat some plain man recount their purposes
p40215
aVKnow what they would

aVWhat would you with the Princess
p40217
aVNothing but peace and gentle visitation
p40218
aVWhat would they say they

aVNothing but peace and gentle visitation
p40220
aVWhy that they have and bid them so be gone
p40221
aVShe says you have it and you may be gone
p40222
aVSay to her we have measured many miles
p40223
aVTo tread a measure with her on this grass
p40224
aVThey say that they have measured many a mile
p40225
aVTo tread a measure with you on this grass
p40226
aVIt is not so Ask them how many inches
p40227
aVIs in one mile If they have measured many
p40228
aVThe measure then of one is eas\u2019ly told
p40229
aVIf to come hither you have measured miles
p40230
aVAnd many miles the Princess bids you tell
p40231
aVHow many inches doth fill up one mile
p40232
aVTell her we measure them by weary steps
p40233
aVShe hears herself
p40234
aVHow many weary steps
p40235
aVOf many weary miles you have o\u2019ergone
p40236
aVAre numbered in the travel of one mile
p40237
aVWe number nothing that we spend for you
p40238
aVOur duty is so rich so infinite
p40239
aVThat we may do it still without account
p40240
aVVouchsafe to show the sunshine of your face
p40241
aVThat we like savages may worship it
p40242
aVMy face is but a moon and clouded too

aVBlessèd are clouds to do as such clouds do
p40244
aVVouchsafe bright moon and these thy stars to shine
p40245
aVThose clouds removed upon our watery eyne
p40246
aVO vain petitioner beg a greater matter
p40247
aVThou now requests but moonshine in the water
p40248
aVThen in our measure do but vouchsafe one change

p40250
aVPlay music then Nay you must do it soon
p40251
aVNot yet No dance Thus change I like the moon

aVWill you not dance How come you thus estranged

aVYet still she is the moon and I the man
p40255
aVThe music plays Vouchsafe some motion to it
p40256
aVOur ears vouchsafe it
p40257
aVBut your legs should do it
p40258
aVSince you are strangers and come here by chance
p40259
aVWe\u2019ll not be nice Take hands We will not dance
p40260
aVWhy take we hands then

aVMight be the be-all and the end-all here
p43870
aVBut here upon this bank and shoal of time
p43871
aVWe\u2019d jump the life to come But in these cases
p43872
aVWe still have judgment here that we but teach

p43882
aVSo clear in his great office that his virtues
p43883
aVWill plead like angels trumpet-tongued against
p43884
aVThe deep damnation of his taking-off
p43885
aVAnd pity like a naked newborn babe
p43886
aVStriding the blast or heaven\u2019s cherubin horsed
p43887
aVUpon the sightless couriers of the air
p43888
aVShall blow the horrid deed in every eye
p43889
aVThat tears shall drown the wind I have no spur
p43890
aVTo prick the sides of my intent but only
p43891
aVVaulting ambition which o\u2019erleaps itself
p43892
aVAnd falls on th\u2019 other

aVHe hath honored me of late and I have bought
p43899
aVGolden opinions from all sorts of people
p43900
aVWhich would be worn now in their newest gloss

aVNot cast aside so soon
p43902
aVWas the hope drunk
p43903
aVWherein you dressed yourself Hath it slept since
p43904
aVAnd wakes it now to look so green and pale
p43905
aVAt what it did so freely From this time
p43906
aVSuch I account thy love Art thou afeard
p43907
aVTo be the same in thine own act and valor
p43908
aVAs thou art in desire Wouldst thou have that
p43909
aVWhich thou esteem\u2019st the ornament of life
p43910
aVAnd live a coward in thine own esteem
p43911
aVLetting I dare not wait upon I would

p43915
aVWho dares do more is none
p43916
aVWhat beast was \u2019t then
p43917
aVThat made you break this enterprise to me
p43918
aVWhen you durst do it then you were a man
p43919
aVAnd to be more than what you were you would
p43920
aVBe so much more the man Nor time nor place

aVThey have made themselves and that their fitness now

aVHave plucked my nipple from his boneless gums
p43927
aVAnd dashed the brains out had I so sworn as you
p43928
aVHave done to this
p43929
aVIf we should fail
p43930
aVWe fail
p43931
aVBut screw your courage to the sticking place
p43932
aVAnd we\u2019ll not fail When Duncan is asleep
p43933
aVWhereto the rather shall his day\u2019s hard journey
p43934
aVSoundly invite him his two chamberlains
p43935
aVWill I with wine and wassail so convince
p43936
aVThat memory the warder of the brain
p43937
aVShall be a fume and the receipt of reason
p43938
aVA limbeck only When in swinish sleep
p43939
aVTheir drenchèd natures lies as in a death
p43940
aVWhat cannot you and I perform upon
p43941
aVTh\u2019 unguarded Duncan What not put upon

aVHis spongy officers who shall bear the guilt
p43943
aVOf our great quell

aVBring forth men-children only
p43945
aVFor thy undaunted mettle should compose
p43946
aVNothing but males Will it not be received
p43947
aVWhen we have marked with blood those sleepy two
p43948
aVOf his own chamber and used their very daggers
p43949
aVThat they have done \u2019t
p43950
aVWho dares receive it other

aVAs we shall make our griefs and clamor roar

aVSent forth great largess to your offices
p43970
aVThis diamond he greets your wife withal
p43971
aVBy the name of most kind hostess and shut up
p43972
aVIn measureless content

aVOur will became the servant to defect
p43975
aVWhich else should free have wrought

aVAll\u2019s well
p43977
aVI dreamt last night of the three Weïrd Sisters
p43978
aVTo you they have showed some truth
p43979
aVI think not of them
p43980
aVYet when we can entreat an hour to serve
p43981
aVWe would spend it in some words upon that business
p43982
aVIf you would grant the time
p43983
aVAt your kind\u2019st leisure
p43984
aVIf you shall cleave to my consent when \u2019tis
p43985
aVIt shall make honor for you
p43986
aVSo I lose none

p43997
aVArt thou not fatal vision sensible
p43998
aVTo feeling as to sight Or art thou but
p43999
aVA dagger of the mind a false creation
p44000
aVProceeding from the heat-oppressèd brain
p44001
aVI see thee yet in form as palpable
p44002
aVAs this which now I draw
p44003
aVThou marshal\u2019st me the way that I was going
p44004
aVAnd such an instrument I was to use
p44005
aVMine eyes are made the fools o\u2019 th\u2019 other senses
p44006
aVOr else worth all the rest I see thee still
p44007
aVAnd on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood
p44008
aVWhich was not so before There\u2019s no such thing
p44009
aVIt is the bloody business which informs
p44010
aVThus to mine eyes Now o\u2019er the one-half world

aVNature seems dead and wicked dreams abuse

aVThe curtained sleep Witchcraft celebrates

aVMoves like a ghost Thou sure and firm-set earth
p44018
aVHear not my steps which way they walk for fear
p44019
aVThy very stones prate of my whereabouts
p44020
aVAnd take the present horror from the time
p44021
aVWhich now suits with it Whiles I threat he lives
p44022
aVWords to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives
p44023
aVI go and it is done The bell invites me
p44024
aVHear it not Duncan for it is a knell
p44025
aVThat summons thee to heaven or to hell
p44026
aVThat which hath made them drunk hath made me bold
p44027
aVWhat hath quenched them hath given me fire Hark Peace
p44028
aVIt was the owl that shrieked the fatal bellman
p44029
aVWhich gives the stern\u2019st good-night He is about it
p44030
aVThe doors are open and the surfeited grooms
p44031
aVDo mock their charge with snores I have drugged their possets
p44032
aVThat death and nature do contend about them
p44033
aVWhether they live or die
p44034
aVWho\u2019s there what ho

p44052
aVThere\u2019s one did laugh in \u2019s sleep and one cried Murder
p44053
aVThat they did wake each other I stood and heard them
p44054
aVBut they did say their prayers and addressed them
p44055
aVAgain to sleep
p44056
aVThere are two lodged together
p44057
aVOne cried God bless us and Amen the other
p44058
aVAs they had seen me with these hangman\u2019s hands
p44059
aVList\u2019ning their fear I could not say Amen
p44060
aVWhen they did say God bless us
p44061
aVConsider it not so deeply
p44062
aVBut wherefore could not I pronounce Amen
p44063
aVI had most need of blessing and Amen
p44064
aVStuck in my throat
p44065
aVThese deeds must not be thought
p44066
aVAfter these ways so it will make us mad

aVStill it cried Sleep no more to all the house
p44075
aVGlamis hath murdered sleep and therefore Cawdor
p44076
aVShall sleep no more Macbeth shall sleep no more
p44077
aVWho was it that thus cried Why worthy thane

p44079
aVSo brainsickly of things Go get some water

p44090
aVThat fears a painted devil If he do bleed
p44091
aVI\u2019ll gild the faces of the grooms withal
p44092
aVFor it must seem their guilt
p44093
aVWhence is that knocking
p44094
aVHow is \u2019t with me when every noise appalls me
p44095
aVWhat hands are here Ha they pluck out mine eyes

aVThat most may claim this argument for ours
p44212
aVWhat should be spoken here where our fate
p44213
aVHid in an auger hole may rush and seize us
p44214
aVLet\u2019s away Our tears are not yet brewed
p44215
aVNor our strong sorrow upon the foot of motion
p44216
aVLook to the lady
p44217
aVAnd when we have our naked frailties hid
p44218
aVThat suffer in exposure let us meet
p44219
aVAnd question this most bloody piece of work
p44220
aVTo know it further Fears and scruples shake us
p44221
aVIn the great hand of God I stand and thence
p44222
aVAgainst the undivulged pretense I fight
p44223
aVOf treasonous malice
p44224
aVAnd so do I
p44225
aVSo all
p44226
aVLet\u2019s briefly put on manly readiness
p44227
aVAnd meet i\u2019 th\u2019 hall together
p44228
aVWell contented
p44229
aVWhat will you do Let\u2019s not consort with them
p44230
aVTo show an unfelt sorrow is an office
p44231
aVWhich the false man does easy I\u2019ll to England
p44232
aVTo Ireland I Our separated fortune
p44233
aVShall keep us both the safer Where we are
p44234
aVThere\u2019s daggers in men\u2019s smiles The near in blood
p44235
aVThe nearer bloody
p44236
aVThis murderous shaft that\u2019s shot
p44237
aVHath not yet lighted and our safest way
p44238
aVIs to avoid the aim Therefore to horse
p44239
aVAnd let us not be dainty of leave-taking
p44240
aVBut shift away There\u2019s warrant in that theft
p44241
aVWhich steals itself when there\u2019s no mercy left
p44242
aVThreescore and ten I can remember well
p44243
aVWithin the volume of which time I have seen
p44244
aVHours dreadful and things strange but this sore night
p44245
aVHath trifled former knowings
p44246
aVHa good father
p44247
aVThou seest the heavens as troubled with man\u2019s act
p44248
aVThreatens his bloody stage By th\u2019 clock \u2019tis day
p44249
aVAnd yet dark night strangles the traveling lamp
p44250
aVIs \u2019t night\u2019s predominance or the day\u2019s shame
p44251
aVThat darkness does the face of earth entomb
p44252
aVWhen living light should kiss it
p44253
aV\u2019Tis unnatural
p44254
aVEven like the deed that\u2019s done On Tuesday last
p44255
aVA falcon tow\u2019ring in her pride of place
p44256
aVWas by a mousing owl hawked at and killed
p44257
aVAnd Duncan\u2019s horses a thing most strange and certain
p44258
aVBeauteous and swift the minions of their race
p44259
aVTurned wild in nature broke their stalls flung out
p44260
aVContending \u2019gainst obedience as they would
p44261
aVMake war with mankind
p44262
aV\u2019Tis said they eat each other
p44263
aVThey did so to th\u2019 amazement of mine eyes
p44264
aVThat looked upon \u2019t
p44265
aVHere comes the good Macduff
p44266
aVHow goes the world sir now
p44267
aVWhy see you not
p44268
aVIs \u2019t known who did this more than bloody deed
p44269
aVThose that Macbeth hath slain
p44270
aVAlas the day
p44271
aVWhat good could they pretend
p44272
aVThey were suborned
p44273
aVMalcolm and Donalbain the King\u2019s two sons
p44274
aVAre stol\u2019n away and fled which puts upon them
p44275
aVSuspicion of the deed
p44276
aV\u2019Gainst nature still
p44277
aVThriftless ambition that will ravin up
p44278
aVThine own lives\u2019 means Then \u2019tis most like
p44279
aVThe sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth
p44280
aVHe is already named and gone to Scone
p44281
aVTo be invested
p44282
aVWhere is Duncan\u2019s body
p44283
aVCarried to Colmekill

aVThou played\u2019st most foully for \u2019t Yet it was said
p44297
aVIt should not stand in thy posterity
p44298
aVBut that myself should be the root and father
p44299
aVOf many kings If there come truth from them
p44300
aVAs upon thee Macbeth their speeches shine
p44301
aVWhy by the verities on thee made good

aVWhose being I do fear and under him

aVMark Antony\u2019s was by Caesar He chid the sisters
p44355
aVWhen first they put the name of king upon me
p44356
aVAnd bade them speak to him Then prophet-like
p44357
aVThey hailed him father to a line of kings
p44358
aVUpon my head they placed a fruitless crown
p44359
aVAnd put a barren scepter in my grip
p44360
aVThence to be wrenched with an unlineal hand
p44361
aVNo son of mine succeeding If \u2019t be so
p44362

aVOur innocent self This I made good to you
p44378
aVIn our last conference passed in probation with you

aVHow you were borne in hand how crossed the instruments
p44380

p44381
aVTo half a soul and to a notion crazed
p44382
aVSay Thus did Banquo

aVAnd beggared yours forever
p44391
aVWe are men my liege
p44392
aVAy in the catalogue you go for men
p44393
aVAs hounds and greyhounds mongrels spaniels curs
p44394
aVShoughs water-rugs and demi-wolves are clept
p44395
aVAll by the name of dogs The valued file
p44396
aVDistinguishes the swift the slow the subtle
p44397
aVThe housekeeper the hunter every one
p44398
aVAccording to the gift which bounteous nature
p44399
aVHath in him closed whereby he does receive
p44400
aVParticular addition from the bill
p44401
aVThat writes them all alike And so of men

p44417
aVBoth of you

aVKnow Banquo was your enemy
p44419
aVTrue my lord
p44420
aVSo is he mine and in such bloody distance
p44421
aVThat every minute of his being thrusts
p44422
aVAgainst my near\u2019st of life And though I could
p44423
aVWith barefaced power sweep him from my sight
p44424
aVAnd bid my will avouch it yet I must not
p44425
aVFor certain friends that are both his and mine
p44426
aVWhose loves I may not drop but wail his fall
p44427
aVWho I myself struck down And thence it is
p44428
aVThat I to your assistance do make love

aVMasking the business from the common eye
p44430
aVFor sundry weighty reasons

aVWhere our desire is got without content
p44457

aVThan by destruction dwell in doubtful joy
p44459
aVHow now my lord why do you keep alone
p44460
aVOf sorriest fancies your companions making
p44461
aVUsing those thoughts which should indeed have died

p44464
aVWe have scorched the snake not killed it
p44465
aVShe\u2019ll close and be herself whilst our poor malice
p44466
aVRemains in danger of her former tooth
p44467
aVBut let the frame of things disjoint both the worlds suffer
p44468
aVEre we will eat our meal in fear and sleep
p44469
aVIn the affliction of these terrible dreams
p44470
aVThat shake us nightly Better be with the dead
p44471
aVWhom we to gain our peace have sent to peace
p44472
aVThan on the torture of the mind to lie

aVApply to Banquo present him eminence
p44484
aVBoth with eye and tongue unsafe the while that we
p44485
aVMust lave our honors in these flattering streams
p44486
aVAnd make our faces vizards to our hearts
p44487
aVDisguising what they are
p44488
aVYou must leave this
p44489
aVO full of scorpions is my mind dear wife

aVBut in them nature\u2019s copy\u2019s not eterne
p44492
aVThere\u2019s comfort yet they are assailable

aVCancel and tear to pieces that great bond
p44504
aVWhich keeps me pale Light thickens and the crow
p44505
aVMakes wing to th\u2019 rooky wood
p44506
aVGood things of day begin to droop and drowse
p44507
aVWhiles night\u2019s black agents to their preys do rouse
p44508
aVThou marvel\u2019st at my words but hold thee still
p44509
aVThings bad begun make strong themselves by ill

p45393
aVCurses not loud but deep mouth-honor breath

aVWe doubt it nothing

aVWhat wood is this before us
p45439
aVThe Wood of Birnam
p45440
aVLet every soldier hew him down a bough

aVIt shall be done

p45447
aVOur setting down before \u2019t
p45448
aV\u2019Tis his main hope
p45449
aVFor where there is advantage to be given
p45450
aVBoth more and less have given him the revolt
p45451
aVAnd none serve with him but constrainèd things
p45452
aVWhose hearts are absent too
p45453
aVLet our just censures
p45454
aVAttend the true event and put we on
p45455
aVIndustrious soldiership
p45456
aVThe time approaches

aVThat will with due decision make us know
p45458
aVWhat we shall say we have and what we owe
p45459
aVThoughts speculative their unsure hopes relate
p45460
aVBut certain issue strokes must arbitrate
p45461
aVTowards which advance the war
p45462
aVHang out our banners on the outward walls
p45463
aVThe cry is still They come Our castle\u2019s strength
p45464
aVWill laugh a siege to scorn Here let them lie
p45465
aVTill famine and the ague eat them up
p45466
aVWere they not forced with those that should be ours
p45467
aVWe might have met them dareful beard to beard
p45468
aVAnd beat them backward home
p45469
aVWhat is that noise
p45470
aVIt is the cry of women my good lord
p45471
aVI have almost forgot the taste of fears
p45472
aVThe time has been my senses would have cooled
p45473
aVTo hear a night-shriek and my fell of hair
p45474
aVWould at a dismal treatise rouse and stir
p45475
aVAs life were in \u2019t I have supped full with horrors
p45476
aVDireness familiar to my slaughterous thoughts
p45477
aVCannot once start me
p45478
aVWherefore was that cry
p45479
aVThe Queen my lord is dead
p45480
aVShe should have died hereafter
p45481
aVThere would have been a time for such a word
p45482
aVTomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow
p45483
aVCreeps in this petty pace from day to day
p45484
aVTo the last syllable of recorded time
p45485
aVAnd all our yesterdays have lighted fools
p45486
aVThe way to dusty death Out out brief candle
p45487
aVLife\u2019s but a walking shadow a poor player
p45488
aVThat struts and frets his hour upon the stage
p45489
aVAnd then is heard no more It is a tale
p45490
aVTold by an idiot full of sound and fury
p45491
aVSignifying nothing
p45492
aVThou com\u2019st to use thy tongue thy story quickly
p45493
aVGracious my lord
p45494
aVI should report that which I say I saw
p45495
aVBut know not how to do \u2019t
p45496
aVWell say sir
p45497
aVAs I did stand my watch upon the hill
p45498
aVI looked toward Birnam and anon methought
p45499
aVThe Wood began to move
p45500
aVLiar and slave
p45501
aVLet me endure your wrath if \u2019t be not so
p45502
aVWithin this three mile may you see it coming
p45503
aVI say a moving grove
p45504
aVIf thou speak\u2019st false
p45505
aVUpon the next tree shall thou hang alive
p45506
aVTill famine cling thee If thy speech be sooth
p45507
aVI care not if thou dost for me as much
p45508
aVI pull in resolution and begin
p45509
aVTo doubt th\u2019 equivocation of the fiend
p45510
aVThat lies like truth Fear not till Birnam Wood
p45511
aVDo come to Dunsinane and now a wood
p45512
aVComes toward Dunsinane Arm arm and out
p45513
aVIf this which he avouches does appear
p45514
aVThere is nor flying hence nor tarrying here
p45515
aVI \u2019gin to be aweary of the sun
p45516
aVAnd wish th\u2019 estate o\u2019 th\u2019 world were now undone
p45517
aVRing the alarum bell Blow wind come wrack
p45518
aVAt least we\u2019ll die with harness on our back
p45519
aVNow near enough Your leafy screens throw down
p45520
aVAnd show like those you are You worthy uncle
p45521
aVShall with my cousin your right noble son
p45522
aVLead our first battle Worthy Macduff and we
p45523
aVShall take upon \u2019s what else remains to do
p45524
aVAccording to our order
p45525
aVFare you well
p45526
aVDo we but find the tyrant\u2019s power tonight
p45527
aVLet us be beaten if we cannot fight
p45528
aVMake all our trumpets speak give them all breath
p45529
aVThose clamorous harbingers of blood and death
p45530
aVThey have tied me to a stake I cannot fly
p45531
aVBut bear-like I must fight the course What\u2019s he
p45532
aVThat was not born of woman Such a one
p45533
aVAm I to fear or none
p45534
aVWhat is thy name
p45535
aVThou \u2019lt be afraid to hear it
p45536
aVNo though thou call\u2019st thyself a hotter name
p45537
aVThan any is in hell
p45538
aVMy name\u2019s Macbeth
p45539
aVThe devil himself could not pronounce a title
p45540
aVMore hateful to mine ear
p45541
aVNo nor more fearful
p45542
aVThou liest abhorrèd tyrant With my sword
p45543
aVI\u2019ll prove the lie thou speak\u2019st
p45544
aVThou wast born of woman
p45545
aVBut swords I smile at weapons laugh to scorn
p45546
aVBrandished by man that\u2019s of a woman born
p45547
aVThat way the noise is Tyrant show thy face
p45548
aVIf thou beest slain and with no stroke of mine
p45549
aVMy wife and children\u2019s ghosts will haunt me still
p45550
aVI cannot strike at wretched kerns whose arms
p45551
aVAre hired to bear their staves Either thou Macbeth
p45552
aVOr else my sword with an unbattered edge
p45553
aVI sheathe again undeeded There thou shouldst be
p45554
aVBy this great clatter one of greatest note
p45555
aVSeems bruited Let me find him Fortune
p45556
aVAnd more I beg not
p45557
aVThis way my lord The castle\u2019s gently rendered
p45558
aVThe tyrant\u2019s people on both sides do fight
p45559
aVThe noble thanes do bravely in the war
p45560
aVThe day almost itself professes yours
p45561
aVAnd little is to do
p45562
aVWe have met with foes
p45563
aVThat strike beside us
p45564
aVEnter sir the castle
p45565
aVWhy should I play the Roman fool and die
p45566
aVOn mine own sword Whiles I see lives the gashes
p45567
aVDo better upon them
p45568
aVTurn hellhound turn
p45569
aVOf all men else I have avoided thee
p45570
aVBut get thee back My soul is too much charged
p45571
aVWith blood of thine already
p45572
aVI have no words
p45573
aVMy voice is in my sword thou bloodier villain
p45574
aVThan terms can give thee out
p45575
aVThou losest labor
p45576
aVAs easy mayst thou the intrenchant air
p45577
aVWith thy keen sword impress as make me bleed
p45578
aVLet fall thy blade on vulnerable crests
p45579
aVI bear a charmèd life which must not yield
p45580
aVTo one of woman born
p45581
aVDespair thy charm
p45582
aVAnd let the angel whom thou still hast served
p45583
aVTell thee Macduff was from his mother\u2019s womb
p45584
aVUntimely ripped
p45585
aVAccursèd be that tongue that tells me so
p45586
aVFor it hath cowed my better part of man
p45587
aVAnd be these juggling fiends no more believed
p45588
aVThat palter with us in a double sense
p45589
aVThat keep the word of promise to our ear
p45590
aVAnd break it to our hope I\u2019ll not fight with thee
p45591
aVThen yield thee coward
p45592
aVAnd live to be the show and gaze o\u2019 th\u2019 time
p45593
aVWe\u2019ll have thee as our rarer monsters are
p45594
aVPainted upon a pole and underwrit
p45595
aVHere may you see the tyrant
p45596
aVI will not yield
p45597
aVTo kiss the ground before young Malcolm\u2019s feet
p45598
aVAnd to be baited with the rabble\u2019s curse
p45599
aVThough Birnam Wood be come to Dunsinane
p45600
aVAnd thou opposed being of no woman born
p45601
aVYet I will try the last Before my body
p45602
aVI throw my warlike shield Lay on Macduff
p45603
aVAnd damned be him that first cries Hold Enough
p45604
aVI would the friends we miss were safe arrived
p45605
aVSome must go off and yet by these I see
p45606
aVSo great a day as this is cheaply bought
p45607
aVMacduff is missing and your noble son
p45608
aVYour son my lord has paid a soldier\u2019s debt
p45609
aVHe only lived but till he was a man
p45610
aVThe which no sooner had his prowess confirmed
p45611
aVIn the unshrinking station where he fought
p45612
aVBut like a man he died
p45613
aVThen he is dead
p45614
aVAy and brought off the field Your cause of sorrow
p45615
aVMust not be measured by his worth for then
p45616
aVIt hath no end
p45617
aVHad he his hurts before
p45618
aVAy on the front
p45619
aVWhy then God\u2019s soldier be he
p45620
aVHad I as many sons as I have hairs
p45621
aVI would not wish them to a fairer death
p45622
aVAnd so his knell is knolled
p45623
aVHe\u2019s worth more sorrow and that I\u2019ll spend for him
p45624
aVHe\u2019s worth no more
p45625
aVThey say he parted well and paid his score
p45626
aVAnd so God be with him Here comes newer comfort
p45627
aVHail King for so thou art Behold where stands
p45628
aVTh\u2019 usurper\u2019s cursèd head The time is free
p45629
aVI see thee compassed with thy kingdom\u2019s pearl
p45630
aVThat speak my salutation in their minds
p45631
aVWhose voices I desire aloud with mine
p45632
aVHail King of Scotland
p45633
aVHail King of Scotland
p45634
aVWe shall not spend a large expense of time
p45635
aVBefore we reckon with your several loves
p45636
aVAnd make us even with you My thanes and kinsmen
p45637
aVHenceforth be earls the first that ever Scotland
p45638
aVIn such an honor named What\u2019s more to do
p45639
aVWhich would be planted newly with the time
p45640
aVAs calling home our exiled friends abroad
p45641
aVThat fled the snares of watchful tyranny
p45642
aVProducing forth the cruel ministers
p45643
aVOf this dead butcher and his fiend-like queen
p45644
aVWho as \u2019tis thought by self and violent hands
p45645
aVTook off her life this and what needful else
p45646
aVThat calls upon us by the grace of grace
p45647
aVWe will perform in measure time and place
p45648
aVSo thanks to all at once and to each one
p45649
aVWhom we invite to see us crowned at Scone
p45650
aVEscalus
p45651
aVMy lord
p45652
aVOf government the properties to unfold
p45653
aVWould seem in me t\u2019 affect speech and discourse
p45654
aVSince I am put to know that your own science
p45655
aVExceeds in that the lists of all advice
p45656
aVMy strength can give you Then no more remains
p45657
aVBut that to your sufficiency as your worth is able
p45658
aVAnd let them work The nature of our people
p45659
aVOur city\u2019s institutions and the terms
p45660
aVFor common justice you\u2019re as pregnant in
p45661
aVAs art and practice hath enrichèd any
p45662
aVThat we remember There is our commission
p45663
aVFrom which we would not have you warp Call hither
p45664
aVI say bid come before us Angelo
p45665
aVWhat figure of us think you he will bear
p45666
aVFor you must know we have with special soul
p45667
aVElected him our absence to supply
p45668
aVLent him our terror dressed him with our love
p45669
aVAnd given his deputation all the organs
p45670
aVOf our own power What think you of it
p45671
aVIf any in Vienna be of worth
p45672
aVTo undergo such ample grace and honor
p45673
aVIt is Lord Angelo
p45674
aVLook where he comes
p45675
aVAlways obedient to your Grace\u2019s will
p45676
aVI come to know your pleasure
p45677
aVAngelo
p45678
aVThere is a kind of character in thy life
p45679
aVThat to th\u2019 observer doth thy history
p45680
aVFully unfold Thyself and thy belongings
p45681
aVAre not thine own so proper as to waste
p45682
aVThyself upon thy virtues they on thee
p45683
aVHeaven doth with us as we with torches do
p45684
aVNot light them for themselves for if our virtues
p45685
aVDid not go forth of us \u2019twere all alike
p45686
aVAs if we had them not Spirits are not finely touched
p45687
aVBut to fine issues nor nature never lends
p45688
aVThe smallest scruple of her excellence
p45689
aVBut like a thrifty goddess she determines
p45690
aVHerself the glory of a creditor
p45691
aVBoth thanks and use But I do bend my speech
p45692
aVTo one that can my part in him advertise
p45693
aVHold therefore Angelo
p45694
aVIn our remove be thou at full ourself
p45695
aVMortality and mercy in Vienna
p45696
aVLive in thy tongue and heart Old Escalus
p45697
aVThough first in question is thy secondary
p45698
aVTake thy commission
p45699
aVNow good my lord
p45700
aVLet there be some more test made of my mettle
p45701
aVBefore so noble and so great a figure
p45702
aVBe stamped upon it
p45703
aVNo more evasion
p45704
aVWe have with a leavened and preparèd choice
p45705
aVProceeded to you Therefore take your honors
p45706
aVOur haste from hence is of so quick condition
p45707
aVThat it prefers itself and leaves unquestioned
p45708
aVMatters of needful value We shall write to you
p45709
aVAs time and our concernings shall importune
p45710
aVHow it goes with us and do look to know
p45711
aVWhat doth befall you here So fare you well
p45712
aVTo th\u2019 hopeful execution do I leave you
p45713
aVOf your commissions
p45714
aVYet give leave my lord
p45715
aVThat we may bring you something on the way
p45716
aVMy haste may not admit it
p45717
aVNor need you on mine honor have to do
p45718
aVWith any scruple Your scope is as mine own
p45719
aVSo to enforce or qualify the laws
p45720
aVAs to your soul seems good Give me your hand
p45721
aVI\u2019ll privily away I love the people
p45722
aVBut do not like to stage me to their eyes
p45723
aVThough it do well I do not relish well
p45724
aVTheir loud applause and aves vehement
p45725
aVNor do I think the man of safe discretion
p45726
aVThat does affect it Once more fare you well
p45727
aVThe heavens give safety to your purposes
p45728
aVLead forth and bring you back in happiness
p45729
aVI thank you Fare you well
p45730
aVI shall desire you sir to give me leave
p45731
aVTo have free speech with you and it concerns me
p45732
aVTo look into the bottom of my place
p45733
aVA power I have but of what strength and nature
p45734
aVI am not yet instructed
p45735
aV\u2019Tis so with me Let us withdraw together
p45736
aVAnd we may soon our satisfaction have
p45737
aVTouching that point
p45738
aVI\u2019ll wait upon your Honor
p45739
aVFellow why dost thou show me thus to th\u2019 world
p45740
aVBear me to prison where I am committed
p45741
aVI do it not in evil disposition
p45742
aVBut from Lord Angelo by special charge
p45743
aVThus can the demigod Authority
p45744
aVMake us pay down for our offense by weight
p45745
aVThe words of heaven on whom it will it will
p45746
aVOn whom it will not so yet still \u2019tis just
p45747
aVWhy how now Claudio Whence comes this restraint
p45748
aVFrom too much liberty my Lucio liberty
p45749
aVAs surfeit is the father of much fast
p45750
aVSo every scope by the immoderate use
p45751
aVTurns to restraint Our natures do pursue
p45752
aVLike rats that raven down their proper bane
p45753
aVA thirsty evil and when we drink we die
p45754
aVWhat but to speak of would offend again
p45755
aVOne word good friend Lucio a word with you
p45756
aVThus stands it with me upon a true contract
p45757
aVI got possession of Julietta\u2019s bed
p45758
aVYou know the lady She is fast my wife
p45759
aVSave that we do the denunciation lack
p45760
aVOf outward order This we came not to
p45761
aVOnly for propagation of a dower
p45762
aVRemaining in the coffer of her friends
p45763
aVFrom whom we thought it meet to hide our love
p45764
aVTill time had made them for us But it chances
p45765
aVThe stealth of our most mutual entertainment
p45766
aVWith character too gross is writ on Juliet
p45767
aVWith child perhaps
p45768
aVUnhappily even so
p45769
aVAnd the new deputy now for the Duke
p45770
aVWhether it be the fault and glimpse of newness
p45771
aVOr whether that the body public be
p45772
aVA horse whereon the governor doth ride
p45773
aVWho newly in the seat that it may know
p45774
aVHe can command lets it straight feel the spur
p45775
aVWhether the tyranny be in his place
p45776
aVOr in his eminence that fills it up
p45777
aVI stagger in but this new governor
p45778
aVAwakes me all the enrollèd penalties
p45779
aVWhich have like unscoured armor hung by th\u2019 wall
p45780
aVSo long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round
p45781
aVAnd none of them been worn and for a name
p45782
aVNow puts the drowsy and neglected act
p45783
aVFreshly on me \u2019Tis surely for a name
p45784
aVI have done so but he\u2019s not to be found
p45785
aVI prithee Lucio do me this kind service
p45786
aVThis day my sister should the cloister enter
p45787
aVAnd there receive her approbation
p45788
aVAcquaint her with the danger of my state
p45789
aVImplore her in my voice that she make friends
p45790
aVTo the strict deputy bid herself assay him
p45791
aVI have great hope in that for in her youth
p45792
aVThere is a prone and speechless dialect
p45793
aVSuch as move men Besides she hath prosperous art
p45794
aVWhen she will play with reason and discourse
p45795
aVAnd well she can persuade
p45796
aVI thank you good friend Lucio
p45797
aVWithin two hours
p45798
aVCome officer away
p45799
aVNo holy father throw away that thought
p45800
aVBelieve not that the dribbling dart of love
p45801
aVCan pierce a complete bosom Why I desire thee
p45802
aVTo give me secret harbor hath a purpose
p45803
aVMore grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends
p45804
aVOf burning youth
p45805
aVMay your Grace speak of it
p45806
aVMy holy sir none better knows than you
p45807
aVHow I have ever loved the life removed
p45808
aVAnd held in idle price to haunt assemblies
p45809
aVWhere youth and cost witless bravery keeps
p45810
aVI have delivered to Lord Angelo
p45811
aVA man of stricture and firm abstinence
p45812
aVMy absolute power and place here in Vienna
p45813
aVAnd he supposes me traveled to Poland
p45814
aVFor so I have strewed it in the common ear
p45815
aVAnd so it is received Now pious sir
p45816
aVYou will demand of me why I do this
p45817
aVGladly my lord
p45818
aVWe have strict statutes and most biting laws
p45819
aVThe needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds
p45820
aVWhich for this fourteen years we have let slip
p45821
aVEven like an o\u2019ergrown lion in a cave
p45822
aVThat goes not out to prey Now as fond fathers
p45823
aVHaving bound up the threat\u2019ning twigs of birch
p45824
aVOnly to stick it in their children\u2019s sight
p45825
aVFor terror not to use in time the rod
p45826
aVMore mocked than feared so our decrees
p45827
aVDead to infliction to themselves are dead
p45828
aVAnd liberty plucks justice by the nose
p45829
aVThe baby beats the nurse and quite athwart
p45830
aVGoes all decorum
p45831
aVIt rested in your Grace
p45832
aVTo unloose this tied-up justice when you pleased
p45833
aVAnd it in you more dreadful would have seemed
p45834
aVThan in Lord Angelo
p45835
aVI do fear too dreadful
p45836
aVSith \u2019twas my fault to give the people scope
p45837
aV\u2019Twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them
p45838
aVFor what I bid them do for we bid this be done
p45839
aVWhen evil deeds have their permissive pass
p45840
aVAnd not the punishment Therefore indeed my father
p45841
aVI have on Angelo imposed the office
p45842
aVWho may in th\u2019 ambush of my name strike home
p45843
aVAnd yet my nature never in the fight
p45844
aVTo do in slander And to behold his sway
p45845
aVI will as \u2019twere a brother of your order
p45846
aVVisit both prince and people Therefore I prithee
p45847
aVSupply me with the habit and instruct me
p45848
aVHow I may formally in person bear
p45849
aVLike a true friar More reasons for this action
p45850
aVAt our more leisure shall I render you
p45851
aVOnly this one Lord Angelo is precise
p45852
aVStands at a guard with envy scarce confesses
p45853
aVThat his blood flows or that his appetite
p45854
aVIs more to bread than stone Hence shall we see
p45855
aVIf power change purpose what our seemers be
p45856
aVAnd have you nuns no farther privileges
p45857
aVAre not these large enough
p45858
aVYes truly I speak not as desiring more
p45859
aVBut rather wishing a more strict restraint
p45860
aVUpon the sisterhood the votarists of Saint Clare
p45861
aVHo peace be in this place
p45862
aVWho\u2019s that which calls
p45863
aVIt is a man\u2019s voice Gentle Isabella
p45864
aVTurn you the key and know his business of him
p45865
aVYou may I may not You are yet unsworn
p45866
aVWhen you have vowed you must not speak with men
p45867
aVBut in the presence of the Prioress
p45868
aVThen if you speak you must not show your face
p45869
aVOr if you show your face you must not speak
p45870
aVHe calls again I pray you answer him
p45871
aVPeace and prosperity Who is \u2019t that calls
p45872
aVHail virgin if you be as those cheek-roses

p45874
aVAs bring me to the sight of Isabella
p45875
aVA novice of this place and the fair sister
p45876

p45880
aVGentle and fair your brother kindly greets you
p45881
aVNot to be weary with you he\u2019s in prison
p45882
aVWoe me for what
p45883
aVFor that which if myself might be his judge
p45884
aVHe should receive his punishment in thanks
p45885
aVHe hath got his friend with child
p45886
aVSir make me not your story
p45887
aV\u2019Tis true
p45888
aVI would not though \u2019tis my familiar sin
p45889
aVWith maids to seem the lapwing and to jest
p45890
aVTongue far from heart play with all virgins so
p45891
aVI hold you as a thing enskied and sainted
p45892
aVBy your renouncement an immortal spirit
p45893
aVAnd to be talked with in sincerity
p45894
aVAs with a saint
p45895
aVYou do blaspheme the good in mocking me
p45896
aVDo not believe it Fewness and truth \u2019tis thus
p45897
aVYour brother and his lover have embraced
p45898
aVAs those that feed grow full as blossoming time
p45899
aVThat from the seedness the bare fallow brings
p45900
aVTo teeming foison even so her plenteous womb
p45901
aVExpresseth his full tilth and husbandry
p45902
aVSomeone with child by him My cousin Juliet
p45903
aVIs she your cousin

p45905
aVBy vain though apt affection
p45906
aVShe it is
p45907
aVO let him marry her
p45908
aVThis is the point
p45909
aVThe Duke is very strangely gone from hence
p45910
aVBore many gentlemen myself being one
p45911
aVIn hand and hope of action but we do learn
p45912
aVBy those that know the very nerves of state
p45913
aVHis givings-out were of an infinite distance
p45914
aVFrom his true-meant design Upon his place
p45915
aVAnd with full line of his authority
p45916
aVGoverns Lord Angelo a man whose blood
p45917
aVIs very snow-broth one who never feels
p45918
aVThe wanton stings and motions of the sense
p45919
aVBut doth rebate and blunt his natural edge
p45920
aVWith profits of the mind study and fast
p45921
aVHe to give fear to use and liberty
p45922
aVWhich have for long run by the hideous law
p45923
aVAs mice by lions hath picked out an act
p45924
aVUnder whose heavy sense your brother\u2019s life
p45925
aVFalls into forfeit He arrests him on it
p45926
aVAnd follows close the rigor of the statute
p45927
aVTo make him an example All hope is gone
p45928
aVUnless you have the grace by your fair prayer
p45929
aVTo soften Angelo And that\u2019s my pith of business
p45930
aV\u2019Twixt you and your poor brother
p45931
aVDoth he so
p45932
aVSeek his life
p45933
aVHas censured him already
p45934
aVAnd as I hear the Provost hath a warrant
p45935
aVFor \u2019s execution
p45936
aVAlas what poor ability\u2019s in me
p45937
aVTo do him good
p45938
aVAssay the power you have
p45939
aVMy power Alas I doubt
p45940
aVOur doubts are traitors
p45941
aVAnd makes us lose the good we oft might win
p45942
aVBy fearing to attempt Go to Lord Angelo
p45943
aVAnd let him learn to know when maidens sue
p45944
aVMen give like gods but when they weep and kneel
p45945
aVAll their petitions are as freely theirs
p45946
aVAs they themselves would owe them
p45947
aVI\u2019ll see what I can do

p45955
aVGood sir adieu
p45956
aVWe must not make a scarecrow of the law
p45957
aVSetting it up to fear the birds of prey
p45958
aVAnd let it keep one shape till custom make it
p45959
aVTheir perch and not their terror
p45960
aVAy but yet
p45961
aVLet us be keen and rather cut a little
p45962
aVThan fall and bruise to death Alas this gentleman
p45963
aVWhom I would save had a most noble father
p45964
aVLet but your Honor know
p45965
aVWhom I believe to be most strait in virtue
p45966
aVThat in the working of your own affections
p45967
aVHad time cohered with place or place with wishing
p45968
aVOr that the resolute acting of your blood
p45969
aVCould have attained th\u2019 effect of your own purpose
p45970
aVWhether you had not sometime in your life
p45971
aVErred in this point which now you censure him
p45972
aVAnd pulled the law upon you
p45973
aV\u2019Tis one thing to be tempted Escalus
p45974
aVAnother thing to fall I not deny
p45975
aVThe jury passing on the prisoner\u2019s life
p45976
aVMay in the sworn twelve have a thief or two
p45977
aVGuiltier than him they try What\u2019s open made to justice
p45978
aVThat justice seizes What knows the laws
p45979
aVThat thieves do pass on thieves \u2019Tis very pregnant
p45980
aVThe jewel that we find we stoop and take \u2019t
p45981
aVBecause we see it but what we do not see
p45982
aVWe tread upon and never think of it
p45983
aVYou may not so extenuate his offense
p45984
aVFor I have had such faults but rather tell me
p45985
aVWhen I that censure him do so offend
p45986
aVLet mine own judgment pattern out my death
p45987
aVAnd nothing come in partial Sir he must die

aVAy touch him there\u2019s the vein
p46104
aVYour brother is a forfeit of the law
p46105
aVAnd you but waste your words
p46106
aVAlas alas

p46119
aVHe\u2019s not prepared for death Even for our kitchens
p46120
aVWe kill the fowl of season Shall we serve heaven
p46121
aVWith less respect than we do minister
p46122
aVTo our gross selves Good good my lord bethink you
p46123
aVWho is it that hath died for this offense
p46124
aVThere\u2019s many have committed it
p46125
aVAy well said
p46126
aVThe law hath not been dead though it hath slept
p46127
aVThose many had not dared to do that evil
p46128
aVIf the first that did th\u2019 edict infringe
p46129
aVHad answered for his deed Now \u2019tis awake
p46130
aVTakes note of what is done and like a prophet
p46131
aVLooks in a glass that shows what future evils
p46132
aVEither now or by remissness new-conceived
p46133
aVAnd so in progress to be hatched and born
p46134
aVAre now to have no successive degrees
p46135
aVBut ere they live to end
p46136
aVYet show some pity
p46137
aVI show it most of all when I show justice
p46138
aVFor then I pity those I do not know
p46139
aVWhich a dismissed offense would after gall
p46140
aVAnd do him right that answering one foul wrong
p46141
aVLives not to act another Be satisfied
p46142
aVYour brother dies tomorrow be content
p46143
aVSo you must be the first that gives this sentence
p46144
aVAnd he that suffers O it is excellent
p46145
aVTo have a giant\u2019s strength but it is tyrannous
p46146
aVTo use it like a giant
p46147
aVThat\u2019s well said
p46148
aVCould great men thunder
p46149
aVAs Jove himself does Jove would never be quiet
p46150
aVFor every pelting petty officer
p46151
aVWould use his heaven for thunder
p46152
aVNothing but thunder Merciful heaven
p46153
aVThou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt
p46154
aVSplits the unwedgeable and gnarlèd oak
p46155
aVThan the soft myrtle But man proud man
p46156
aVDressed in a little brief authority
p46157
aVMost ignorant of what he\u2019s most assured
p46158
aVHis glassy essence like an angry ape
p46159
aVPlays such fantastic tricks before high heaven
p46160
aVAs makes the angels weep who with our spleens
p46161
aVWould all themselves laugh mortal
p46162
aVO to him to him wench He will relent
p46163
aVHe\u2019s coming I perceive \u2019t
p46164
aVPray heaven she win him
p46165
aVWe cannot weigh our brother with ourself
p46166
aVGreat men may jest with saints \u2019tis wit in them
p46167
aVBut in the less foul profanation
p46168
aVThou \u2019rt i\u2019 th\u2019 right girl More o\u2019 that
p46169
aVThat in the captain\u2019s but a choleric word
p46170
aVWhich in the soldier is flat blasphemy
p46171
aVArt avised o\u2019 that More on \u2019t
p46172
aVWhy do you put these sayings upon me
p46173
aVBecause authority though it err like others
p46174

aVLet it not sound a thought upon your tongue

aVAgainst my brother\u2019s life

aVThat my sense breeds with it

aVDo as the carrion does not as the flower
p46213
aVCorrupt with virtuous season Can it be
p46214
aVThat modesty may more betray our sense
p46215
aVThan woman\u2019s lightness Having waste ground enough

aVShall we desire to raze the sanctuary

aVAnd pitch our evils there O fie fie fie

aVHail to you provost so I think you are
p46234
aVI am the Provost What\u2019s your will good friar

aVBound by my charity and my blest order

aVI come to visit the afflicted spirits
p46237
aVHere in the prison Do me the common right

aVTo let me see them and to make me know
p46239
aVThe nature of their crimes that I may minister
p46240
aVTo them accordingly
p46241
aVI would do more than that if more were needful

p46249
aVAs I do think tomorrow
p46250
aVTo Juliet I have provided for you Stay awhile
p46251
aVAnd you shall be conducted
p46252
aVRepent you fair one of the sin you carry
p46253
aVI do and bear the shame most patiently
p46254
aVI\u2019ll teach you how you shall arraign your conscience
p46255
aVAnd try your penitence if it be sound
p46256
aVOr hollowly put on
p46257
aVI\u2019ll gladly learn
p46258
aVLove you the man that wronged you
p46259
aVYes as I love the woman that wronged him
p46260
aVSo then it seems your most offenseful act
p46261
aVWas mutually committed
p46262
aVMutually
p46263
aVThen was your sin of heavier kind than his
p46264
aVI do confess it and repent it father
p46265
aV\u2019Tis meet so daughter but lest you do repent
p46266
aVAs that the sin hath brought you to this shame
p46267
aVWhich sorrow is always toward ourselves not heaven
p46268
aVShowing we would not spare heaven as we love it
p46269
aVBut as we stand in fear

aVI do repent me as it is an evil
p46271
aVAnd take the shame with joy
p46272
aVThere rest

p46277
aVThat respites me a life whose very comfort
p46278
aVIs still a dying horror

aV\u2019Tis pity of him
p46280
aVWhen I would pray and think I think and pray
p46281
aVTo several subjects Heaven hath my empty words
p46282
aVWhilst my invention hearing not my tongue
p46283
aVAnchors on Isabel God in my mouth
p46284
aVAs if I did but only chew His name
p46285
aVAnd in my heart the strong and swelling evil
p46286
aVOf my conception The state whereon I studied
p46287
aVIs like a good thing being often read
p46288
aVGrown sere and tedious Yea my gravity
p46289
aVWherein let no man hear me I take pride
p46290
aVCould I with boot change for an idle plume
p46291
aVWhich the air beats for vain O place O form
p46292
aVHow often dost thou with thy case thy habit
p46293
aVWrench awe from fools and tie the wiser souls
p46294
aVTo thy false seeming Blood thou art blood
p46295
aVLet\u2019s write good angel on the devil\u2019s horn

aV\u2019Tis not the devil\u2019s crest Knock within How now who\u2019s there
p46297
aVOne Isabel a sister desires access to you
p46298
aVTeach her the way Servant exits O heavens
p46299
aVWhy does my blood thus muster to my heart
p46300
aVMaking both it unable for itself
p46301
aVAnd dispossessing all my other parts
p46302
aVOf necessary fitness
p46303
aVSo play the foolish throngs with one that swoons
p46304
aVCome all to help him and so stop the air
p46305
aVBy which he should revive And even so
p46306
aVThe general subject to a well-wished king
p46307
aVQuit their own part and in obsequious fondness
p46308
aVCrowd to his presence where their untaught love
p46309
aVMust needs appear offense
p46310
aVHow now fair maid
p46311
aVI am come to know your pleasure
p46312
aVThat you might know it would much better please me
p46313
aVThan to demand what \u2019tis Your brother cannot live
p46314
aVEven so Heaven keep your Honor
p46315
aVYet may he live a while And it may be
p46316
aVAs long as you or I Yet he must die
p46317
aVUnder your sentence

aVYea
p46319
aVWhen I beseech you That in his reprieve
p46320
aVLonger or shorter he may be so fitted
p46321
aVThat his soul sicken not
p46322
aVHa Fie these filthy vices It were as good
p46323
aVTo pardon him that hath from nature stolen
p46324
aVA man already made as to remit
p46325
aVTheir saucy sweetness that do coin God\u2019s image
p46326
aVIn stamps that are forbid \u2019Tis all as easy
p46327
aVFalsely to take away a life true made
p46328
aVAs to put metal in restrainèd means
p46329
aVTo make a false one
p46330
aV\u2019Tis set down so in heaven but not in Earth
p46331
aVSay you so Then I shall pose you quickly
p46332
aVWhich had you rather that the most just law
p46333
aVNow took your brother\u2019s life or to redeem him
p46334
aVGive up your body to such sweet uncleanness
p46335
aVAs she that he hath stained
p46336
aVSir believe this
p46337
aVI had rather give my body than my soul
p46338
aVI talk not of your soul Our compelled sins
p46339
aVStand more for number than for accompt
p46340
aVHow say you
p46341
aVNay I\u2019ll not warrant that for I can speak
p46342
aVAgainst the thing I say Answer to this
p46343
aVI now the voice of the recorded law
p46344
aVPronounce a sentence on your brother\u2019s life
p46345
aVMight there not be a charity in sin
p46346
aVTo save this brother\u2019s life
p46347
aVPlease you to do \u2019t
p46348
aVI\u2019ll take it as a peril to my soul
p46349
aVIt is no sin at all but charity
p46350
aVPleased you to do \u2019t at peril of your soul
p46351
aVWere equal poise of sin and charity
p46352
aVThat I do beg his life if it be sin
p46353
aVHeaven let me bear it You granting of my suit
p46354
aVIf that be sin I\u2019ll make it my morn prayer
p46355
aVTo have it added to the faults of mine
p46356
aVAnd nothing of your answer
p46357
aVNay but hear me
p46358
aVYour sense pursues not mine Either you are ignorant
p46359
aVOr seem so crafty and that\u2019s not good
p46360
aVLet me be ignorant and in nothing good
p46361
aVBut graciously to know I am no better
p46362
aVThus wisdom wishes to appear most bright
p46363
aVWhen it doth tax itself as these black masks
p46364
aVProclaim an enshield beauty ten times louder
p46365
aVThan beauty could displayed But mark me
p46366
aVTo be receivèd plain I\u2019ll speak more gross
p46367
aVYour brother is to die
p46368
aVSo
p46369
aVAnd his offense is so as it appears
p46370
aVAccountant to the law upon that pain
p46371
aVTrue
p46372
aVAdmit no other way to save his life
p46373
aVAs I subscribe not that nor any other
p46374
aVBut in the loss of question that you his sister
p46375
aVFinding yourself desired of such a person
p46376
aVWhose credit with the judge or own great place
p46377
aVCould fetch your brother from the manacles
p46378
aVOf the all-binding law and that there were
p46379
aVNo earthly mean to save him but that either
p46380
aVYou must lay down the treasures of your body
p46381
aVTo this supposed or else to let him suffer
p46382
aVWhat would you do
p46383
aVAs much for my poor brother as myself
p46384
aVThat is were I under the terms of death
p46385
aVTh\u2019 impression of keen whips I\u2019d wear as rubies
p46386
aVAnd strip myself to death as to a bed
p46387
aVThat longing have been sick for ere I\u2019d yield
p46388
aVMy body up to shame
p46389
aVThen must your brother die
p46390
aVAnd \u2019twere the cheaper way
p46391
aVBetter it were a brother died at once
p46392
aVThan that a sister by redeeming him
p46393
aVShould die forever
p46394
aVWere not you then as cruel as the sentence
p46395
aVThat you have slandered so
p46396
aVIgnomy in ransom and free pardon
p46397
aVAre of two houses Lawful mercy
p46398
aVIs nothing kin to foul redemption
p46399
aVYou seemed of late to make the law a tyrant
p46400
aVAnd rather proved the sliding of your brother
p46401
aVA merriment than a vice
p46402
aVO pardon me my lord It oft falls out
p46403
aVTo have what we would have we speak not what we mean
p46404
aVI something do excuse the thing I hate
p46405
aVFor his advantage that I dearly love
p46406
aVWe are all frail
p46407
aVElse let my brother die
p46408
aVIf not a fedary but only he
p46409
aVOwe and succeed thy weakness
p46410
aVNay women are frail too
p46411
aVAy as the glasses where they view themselves
p46412
aVWhich are as easy broke as they make forms
p46413
aVWomen help heaven men their creation mar
p46414
aVIn profiting by them Nay call us ten times frail
p46415
aVFor we are soft as our complexions are
p46416
aVAnd credulous to false prints
p46417
aVI think it well
p46418
aVAnd from this testimony of your own sex
p46419
aVSince I suppose we are made to be no stronger
p46420
aVThan faults may shake our frames let me be bold
p46421
aVI do arrest your words Be that you are
p46422
aVThat is a woman If you be more you\u2019re none
p46423
aVIf you be one as you are well expressed
p46424
aVBy all external warrants show it now
p46425
aVBy putting on the destined livery
p46426
aVI have no tongue but one Gentle my lord
p46427
aVLet me entreat you speak the former language
p46428
aVPlainly conceive I love you
p46429
aVMy brother did love Juliet
p46430
aVAnd you tell me that he shall die for \u2019t
p46431
aVHe shall not Isabel if you give me love
p46432
aVI know your virtue hath a license in \u2019t
p46433
aVWhich seems a little fouler than it is
p46434
aVTo pluck on others
p46435
aVBelieve me on mine honor
p46436
aVMy words express my purpose
p46437
aVHa Little honor to be much believed
p46438
aVAnd most pernicious purpose Seeming seeming
p46439
aVI will proclaim thee Angelo look for \u2019t
p46440
aVSign me a present pardon for my brother
p46441
aVOr with an outstretched throat I\u2019ll tell the world aloud
p46442
aVWhat man thou art
p46443
aVWho will believe thee Isabel
p46444
aVMy unsoiled name th\u2019 austereness of my life
p46445
aVMy vouch against you and my place i\u2019 th\u2019 state
p46446
aVWill so your accusation overweigh
p46447
aVThat you shall stifle in your own report
p46448
aVAnd smell of calumny I have begun
p46449
aVAnd now I give my sensual race the rein
p46450
aVFit thy consent to my sharp appetite
p46451
aVLay by all nicety and prolixious blushes
p46452
aVThat banish what they sue for Redeem thy brother
p46453
aVBy yielding up thy body to my will
p46454
aVOr else he must not only die the death
p46455
aVBut thy unkindness shall his death draw out
p46456
aVTo ling\u2019ring sufferance Answer me tomorrow
p46457
aVOr by the affection that now guides me most
p46458
aVI\u2019ll prove a tyrant to him As for you
p46459
aVSay what you can my false o\u2019erweighs your true
p46460
aVTo whom should I complain Did I tell this
p46461
aVWho would believe me O perilous mouths
p46462
aVThat bear in them one and the selfsame tongue
p46463
aVEither of condemnation or approof
p46464
aVBidding the law make curtsy to their will
p46465
aVHooking both right and wrong to th\u2019 appetite
p46466
aVTo follow as it draws I\u2019ll to my brother
p46467
aVThough he hath fall\u2019n by prompture of the blood
p46468
aVYet hath he in him such a mind of honor
p46469
aVThat had he twenty heads to tender down
p46470
aVOn twenty bloody blocks he\u2019d yield them up
p46471
aVBefore his sister should her body stoop
p46472
aVTo such abhorred pollution
p46473
aVThen Isabel live chaste and brother die
p46474
aVMore than our brother is our chastity
p46475
aVI\u2019ll tell him yet of Angelo\u2019s request
p46476
aVAnd fit his mind to death for his soul\u2019s rest
p46477
aVSo then you hope of pardon from Lord Angelo
p46478
aVThe miserable have no other medicine
p46479
aVBut only hope
p46480
aVI have hope to live and am prepared to die
p46481
aVBe absolute for death Either death or life
p46482
aVShall thereby be the sweeter Reason thus with life
p46483
aVIf I do lose thee I do lose a thing
p46484
aVThat none but fools would keep A breath thou art
p46485
aVServile to all the skyey influences
p46486
aVThat doth this habitation where thou keep\u2019st
p46487
aVHourly afflict Merely thou art death\u2019s fool
p46488
aVFor him thou labor\u2019st by thy flight to shun
p46489
aVAnd yet runn\u2019st toward him still Thou art not noble
p46490
aVFor all th\u2019 accommodations that thou bear\u2019st
p46491
aVAre nursed by baseness Thou \u2019rt by no means valiant
p46492
aVFor thou dost fear the soft and tender fork
p46493
aVOf a poor worm Thy best of rest is sleep
p46494
aVAnd that thou oft provok\u2019st yet grossly fear\u2019st
p46495
aVThy death which is no more Thou art not thyself
p46496
aVFor thou exists on many a thousand grains
p46497
aVThat issue out of dust Happy thou art not
p46498
aVFor what thou hast not still thou striv\u2019st to get
p46499
aVAnd what thou hast forget\u2019st Thou art not certain
p46500
aVFor thy complexion shifts to strange effects
p46501
aVAfter the moon If thou art rich thou \u2019rt poor
p46502
aVFor like an ass whose back with ingots bows
p46503
aVThou bear\u2019st thy heavy riches but a journey
p46504
aVAnd death unloads thee Friend hast thou none
p46505
aVFor thine own bowels which do call thee sire
p46506
aVThe mere effusion of thy proper loins
p46507
aVDo curse the gout serpigo and the rheum
p46508
aVFor ending thee no sooner Thou hast nor youth nor age
p46509
aVBut as it were an after-dinner\u2019s sleep
p46510
aVDreaming on both for all thy blessèd youth
p46511
aVBecomes as agèd and doth beg the alms
p46512
aVOf palsied eld and when thou art old and rich
p46513
aVThou hast neither heat affection limb nor beauty
p46514
aVTo make thy riches pleasant What\u2019s yet in this
p46515
aVThat bears the name of life Yet in this life
p46516
aVLie hid more thousand deaths yet death we fear
p46517
aVThat makes these odds all even
p46518
aVI humbly thank you
p46519
aVTo sue to live I find I seek to die
p46520
aVAnd seeking death find life Let it come on
p46521
aVWhat ho Peace here grace and good company
p46522
aVWho\u2019s there Come in The wish deserves a welcome
p46523
aVDear sir ere long I\u2019ll visit you again
p46524
aVMost holy sir I thank you
p46525
aVMy business is a word or two with Claudio
p46526
aVAnd very welcome Look signior here\u2019s your sister
p46527
aVProvost a word with you
p46528
aVAs many as you please
p46529
aVBring me to hear them speak where I may be concealed
p46530
aVNow sister what\u2019s the comfort
p46531
aVWhy
p46532
aVAs all comforts are most good most good indeed
p46533
aVLord Angelo having affairs to heaven
p46534
aVIntends you for his swift ambassador
p46535
aVWhere you shall be an everlasting leiger
p46536
aVTherefore your best appointment make with speed
p46537
aVTomorrow you set on
p46538
aVIs there no remedy
p46539
aVNone but such remedy as to save a head
p46540
aVTo cleave a heart in twain
p46541
aVBut is there any
p46542
aVYes brother you may live
p46543
aVThere is a devilish mercy in the judge
p46544
aVIf you\u2019ll implore it that will free your life
p46545
aVBut fetter you till death
p46546
aVPerpetual durance
p46547
aVAy just perpetual durance a restraint
p46548
aVThough all the world\u2019s vastidity you had
p46549
aVTo a determined scope
p46550
aVBut in what nature
p46551
aVIn such a one as you consenting to \u2019t
p46552
aVWould bark your honor from that trunk you bear
p46553
aVAnd leave you naked
p46554
aVLet me know the point
p46555
aVO I do fear thee Claudio and I quake
p46556
aVLest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain
p46557
aVAnd six or seven winters more respect
p46558
aVThan a perpetual honor Dar\u2019st thou die
p46559
aVThe sense of death is most in apprehension
p46560
aVAnd the poor beetle that we tread upon
p46561
aVIn corporal sufferance finds a pang as great
p46562

aVMended again The matter proceed
p47068
aVIn brief to set the needless process by
p47069
aVHow I persuaded how I prayed and kneeled
p47070
aVHow he refelled me and how I replied
p47071
aVFor this was of much length the vile conclusion
p47072
aVI now begin with grief and shame to utter
p47073
aVHe would not but by gift of my chaste body
p47074
aVTo his concupiscible intemperate lust
p47075
aVRelease my brother and after much debatement
p47076
aVMy sisterly remorse confutes mine honor

aVO that it were as like as it is true
p47082
aVBy heaven fond wretch thou know\u2019st not what thou speak\u2019st
p47083
aVOr else thou art suborned against his honor
p47084
aVIn hateful practice First his integrity
p47085
aVStands without blemish next it imports no reason
p47086
aVThat with such vehemency he should pursue
p47087
aVFaults proper to himself If he had so offended
p47088
aVHe would have weighed thy brother by himself
p47089
aVAnd not have cut him off Someone hath set you on
p47090
aVConfess the truth and say by whose advice
p47091
aVThou cam\u2019st here to complain
p47092

aVThis is that face thou cruel Angelo
p47173
aVWhich once thou swor\u2019st was worth the looking on

p47186
aVPartly for that her promisèd proportions

aVAgainst all sense you do importune her
p47357
aVShould she kneel down in mercy of this fact
p47358
aVHer brother\u2019s ghost his pavèd bed would break

p47368
aVMost bounteous sir
p47369
aVLook if it please you on this man condemned
p47370
aVAs if my brother lived I partly think
p47371
aVA due sincerity governed his deeds
p47372
aVTill he did look on me Since it is so
p47373
aVLet him not die My brother had but justice
p47374
aVIn that he did the thing for which he died
p47375
aVFor Angelo
p47376
aVHis act did not o\u2019ertake his bad intent
p47377
aVAnd must be buried but as an intent
p47378
aVThat perished by the way Thoughts are no subjects
p47379
aVIntents but merely thoughts
p47380
aVMerely my lord
p47381
aVYour suit\u2019s unprofitable Stand up I say

p47383
aVProvost how came it Claudio was beheaded

aVIt was commanded so

aVPardon me noble lord

aVFor testimony whereof one in the prison
p47394
aVThat should by private order else have died
p47395
aVI have reserved alive
p47396
aVWhat\u2019s he
p47397
aVHis name is Barnardine
p47398
aVI would thou hadst done so by Claudio
p47399
aVGo fetch him hither Let me look upon him
p47400
aVI am sorry one so learnèd and so wise
p47401
aVAs you Lord Angelo have still appeared
p47402
aVShould slip so grossly both in the heat of blood
p47403
aVAnd lack of tempered judgment afterward
p47404
aVI am sorry that such sorrow I procure
p47405
aVAnd so deep sticks it in my penitent heart
p47406
aVThat I crave death more willingly than mercy
p47407
aV\u2019Tis my deserving and I do entreat it
p47408
aVWhich is that Barnardine
p47409
aVThis my lord
p47410
aVThere was a friar told me of this man
p47411
aVSirrah thou art said to have a stubborn soul

p47416
aVFor better times to come Friar advise him
p47417
aVI leave him to your hand What muffled fellow\u2019s that
p47418
aVThis is another prisoner that I saved
p47419
aVWho should have died when Claudio lost his head
p47420
aVAs like almost to Claudio as himself
p47421
aVIf he be like your brother for his sake
p47422
aVIs he pardoned and for your lovely sake
p47423
aVGive me your hand and say you will be mine
p47424
aVHe is my brother too But fitter time for that

aVHippolyta I wooed thee with my sword

aVThis man hath my consent to marry her
p47488
aVStand forth Lysander And my gracious duke
p47489
aVThis man hath bewitched the bosom of my child
p47490
aVThou thou Lysander thou hast given her rhymes
p47491
aVAnd interchanged love tokens with my child
p47492
aVThou hast by moonlight at her window sung
p47493
aVWith feigning voice verses of feigning love
p47494
aVAnd stol\u2019n the impression of her fantasy
p47495
aVWith bracelets of thy hair rings gauds conceits
p47496
aVKnacks trifles nosegays sweetmeats messengers
p47497

p47499
aVTurned her obedience which is due to me
p47500
aVTo stubborn harshness And my gracious duke
p47501
aVBe it so she will not here before your Grace
p47502
aVConsent to marry with Demetrius
p47503
aVI beg the ancient privilege of Athens
p47504
aVAs she is mine I may dispose of her
p47505
aVWhich shall be either to this gentleman
p47506
aVOr to her death according to our law
p47507
aVImmediately provided in that case
p47508
aVWhat say you Hermia Be advised fair maid
p47509
aVTo you your father should be as a god
p47510
aVOne that composed your beauties yea and one
p47511
aVTo whom you are but as a form in wax
p47512
aVBy him imprinted and within his power
p47513
aVTo leave the figure or disfigure it
p47514
aVDemetrius is a worthy gentleman
p47515
aVSo is Lysander
p47516
aVIn himself he is
p47517
aVBut in this kind wanting your father\u2019s voice
p47518
aVThe other must be held the worthier
p47519
aVI would my father looked but with my eyes
p47520
aVRather your eyes must with his judgment look
p47521
aVI do entreat your Grace to pardon me
p47522
aVI know not by what power I am made bold
p47523
aVNor how it may concern my modesty
p47524
aVIn such a presence here to plead my thoughts
p47525
aVBut I beseech your Grace that I may know
p47526
aVThe worst that may befall me in this case
p47527
aVIf I refuse to wed Demetrius
p47528
aVEither to die the death or to abjure
p47529
aVForever the society of men
p47530
aVTherefore fair Hermia question your desires
p47531
aVKnow of your youth examine well your blood
p47532
aVWhether if you yield not to your father\u2019s choice
p47533
aVYou can endure the livery of a nun
p47534
aVFor aye to be in shady cloister mewed
p47535
aVTo live a barren sister all your life
p47536
aVChanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon
p47537
aVThrice-blessèd they that master so their blood
p47538
aVTo undergo such maiden pilgrimage
p47539
aVBut earthlier happy is the rose distilled
p47540
aVThan that which withering on the virgin thorn
p47541
aVGrows lives and dies in single blessedness
p47542
aVSo will I grow so live so die my lord
p47543
aVEre I will yield my virgin patent up
p47544
aVUnto his Lordship whose unwishèd yoke
p47545
aVMy soul consents not to give sovereignty

aVTake time to pause and by the next new moon

aVThe sealing day betwixt my love and me
p47548
aVFor everlasting bond of fellowship
p47549
aVUpon that day either prepare to die
p47550
aVFor disobedience to your father\u2019s will
p47551
aVOr else to wed Demetrius as he would
p47552
aVOr on Diana\u2019s altar to protest
p47553
aVFor aye austerity and single life
p47554
aVRelent sweet Hermia and Lysander yield
p47555
aVThy crazèd title to my certain right
p47556
aVYou have her father\u2019s love Demetrius
p47557
aVLet me have Hermia\u2019s Do you marry him
p47558
aVScornful Lysander true he hath my love
p47559
aVAnd what is mine my love shall render him
p47560
aVAnd she is mine and all my right of her
p47561
aVI do estate unto Demetrius
p47562
aVI am my lord as well derived as he
p47563
aVAs well possessed My love is more than his
p47564
aVMy fortunes every way as fairly ranked
p47565
aVIf not with vantage as Demetrius\u2019
p47566
aVAnd which is more than all these boasts can be
p47567
aVI am beloved of beauteous Hermia
p47568
aVWhy should not I then prosecute my right
p47569
aVDemetrius I\u2019ll avouch it to his head
p47570
aVMade love to Nedar\u2019s daughter Helena
p47571

p47572
aVDevoutly dotes dotes in idolatry
p47573
aVUpon this spotted and inconstant man
p47574
aVI must confess that I have heard so much
p47575
aVAnd with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof
p47576
aVBut being overfull of self-affairs
p47577
aVMy mind did lose it But Demetrius come
p47578
aVAnd come Egeus you shall go with me
p47579
aVI have some private schooling for you both
p47580
aVFor you fair Hermia look you arm yourself
p47581
aVTo fit your fancies to your father\u2019s will
p47582
aVOr else the law of Athens yields you up
p47583
aVWhich by no means we may extenuate
p47584
aVTo death or to a vow of single life
p47585
aVCome my Hippolyta What cheer my love
p47586
aVDemetrius and Egeus go along
p47587
aVI must employ you in some business
p47588
aVAgainst our nuptial and confer with you
p47589
aVOf something nearly that concerns yourselves
p47590
aVWith duty and desire we follow you
p47591
aVHow now my love Why is your cheek so pale
p47592
aVHow chance the roses there do fade so fast
p47593
aVBelike for want of rain which I could well
p47594
aVBeteem them from the tempest of my eyes
p47595
aVAy me For aught that I could ever read
p47596
aVCould ever hear by tale or history
p47597
aVThe course of true love never did run smooth
p47598
aVBut either it was different in blood
p47599
aVO cross Too high to be enthralled to low
p47600
aVOr else misgraffèd in respect of years
p47601
aVO spite Too old to be engaged to young
p47602
aVOr else it stood upon the choice of friends
p47603
aVO hell to choose love by another\u2019s eyes
p47604
aVOr if there were a sympathy in choice
p47605
aVWar death or sickness did lay siege to it
p47606
aVMaking it momentany as a sound
p47607
aVSwift as a shadow short as any dream
p47608
aVBrief as the lightning in the collied night
p47609
aVThat in a spleen unfolds both heaven and Earth
p47610
aVAnd ere a man hath power to say Behold
p47611
aVThe jaws of darkness do devour it up
p47612
aVSo quick bright things come to confusion
p47613
aVIf then true lovers have been ever crossed
p47614
aVIt stands as an edict in destiny
p47615
aVThen let us teach our trial patience
p47616
aVBecause it is a customary cross
p47617
aVAs due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs
p47618
aVWishes and tears poor fancy\u2019s followers
p47619
aVA good persuasion Therefore hear me Hermia

aVFrom Athens is her house remote seven leagues
p47623
aVAnd she respects me as her only son
p47624
aVThere gentle Hermia may I marry thee
p47625
aVAnd to that place the sharp Athenian law
p47626
aVCannot pursue us If thou lovest me then
p47627
aVSteal forth thy father\u2019s house tomorrow night
p47628
aVAnd in the wood a league without the town
p47629
aVWhere I did meet thee once with Helena
p47630
aVTo do observance to a morn of May
p47631
aVThere will I stay for thee
p47632
aVMy good Lysander
p47633
aVI swear to thee by Cupid\u2019s strongest bow
p47634
aVBy his best arrow with the golden head
p47635
aVBy the simplicity of Venus\u2019 doves
p47636
aVBy that which knitteth souls and prospers loves
p47637
aVAnd by that fire which burned the Carthage queen
p47638
aVWhen the false Trojan under sail was seen
p47639
aVBy all the vows that ever men have broke
p47640
aVIn number more than ever women spoke

aVGodspeed fair Helena Whither away
p47645
aVCall you me fair That fair again unsay
p47646
aVDemetrius loves your fair O happy fair
p47647
aVYour eyes are lodestars and your tongue\u2019s sweet air
p47648
aVMore tunable than lark to shepherd\u2019s ear
p47649
aVWhen wheat is green when hawthorn buds appear
p47650
aVSickness is catching O were favor so
p47651
aVYours would I catch fair Hermia ere I go
p47652
aVMy ear should catch your voice my eye your eye

aVMy tongue should catch your tongue\u2019s sweet melody
p47654
aVWere the world mine Demetrius being bated
p47655
aVThe rest I\u2019d give to be to you translated
p47656
aVO teach me how you look and with what art
p47657
aVYou sway the motion of Demetrius\u2019 heart
p47658
aVI frown upon him yet he loves me still
p47659
aVO that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill
p47660
aVI give him curses yet he gives me love
p47661
aVO that my prayers could such affection move
p47662
aVThe more I hate the more he follows me
p47663
aVThe more I love the more he hateth me

aVNone but your beauty Would that fault were mine
p47666
aVTake comfort he no more shall see my face
p47667
aVLysander and myself will fly this place
p47668
aVBefore the time I did Lysander see
p47669
aVSeemed Athens as a paradise to me
p47670
aVO then what graces in my love do dwell
p47671
aVThat he hath turned a heaven unto a hell
p47672
aVHelen to you our minds we will unfold
p47673
aVTomorrow night when Phoebe doth behold
p47674
aVHer silver visage in the wat\u2019ry glass
p47675
aVDecking with liquid pearl the bladed grass
p47676
aVA time that lovers\u2019 flights doth still conceal
p47677
aVThrough Athens\u2019 gates have we devised to steal
p47678
aVAnd in the wood where often you and I
p47679
aVUpon faint primrose beds were wont to lie
p47680
aVEmptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet
p47681
aVThere my Lysander and myself shall meet
p47682
aVAnd thence from Athens turn away our eyes
p47683
aVTo seek new friends and stranger companies
p47684
aVFarewell sweet playfellow Pray thou for us
p47685
aVAnd good luck grant thee thy Demetrius
p47686
aVKeep word Lysander We must starve our sight
p47687
aVFrom lovers\u2019 food till morrow deep midnight
p47688
aVI will my Hermia
p47689
aVHelena adieu
p47690
aVAs you on him Demetrius dote on you
p47691
aVHow happy some o\u2019er other some can be
p47692
aVThrough Athens I am thought as fair as she
p47693
aVBut what of that Demetrius thinks not so
p47694
aVHe will not know what all but he do know
p47695
aVAnd as he errs doting on Hermia\u2019s eyes
p47696
aVSo I admiring of his qualities
p47697
aVThings base and vile holding no quantity
p47698
aVLove can transpose to form and dignity
p47699
aVLove looks not with the eyes but with the mind
p47700
aVAnd therefore is winged Cupid painted blind
p47701
aVNor hath Love\u2019s mind of any judgment taste
p47702
aVWings and no eyes figure unheedy haste
p47703
aVAnd therefore is Love said to be a child
p47704
aVBecause in choice he is so oft beguiled
p47705
aVAs waggish boys in game themselves forswear
p47706
aVSo the boy Love is perjured everywhere
p47707
aVFor ere Demetrius looked on Hermia\u2019s eyne
p47708
aVHe hailed down oaths that he was only mine
p47709
aVAnd when this hail some heat from Hermia felt
p47710
aVSo he dissolved and show\u2019rs of oaths did melt
p47711
aVI will go tell him of fair Hermia\u2019s flight
p47712
aVThen to the wood will he tomorrow night
p47713
aVPursue her And for this intelligence
p47714
aVIf I have thanks it is a dear expense
p47715
aVBut herein mean I to enrich my pain
p47716
aVTo have his sight thither and back again
p47717
aVThe raging rocks
p47718
aVAnd shivering shocks
p47719
aVShall break the locks
p47720
aVOf prison gates
p47721
aVAnd Phibbus\u2019 car
p47722
aVShall shine from far
p47723
aVAnd make and mar
p47724
aVThe foolish Fates
p47725
aVHow now spirit Whither wander you
p47726
aVOver hill over dale
p47727
aVThorough bush thorough brier
p47728
aVOver park over pale
p47729
aVThorough flood thorough fire
p47730
aVI do wander everywhere
p47731
aVSwifter than the moon\u2019s sphere
p47732
aVAnd I serve the Fairy Queen
p47733
aVTo dew her orbs upon the green
p47734
aVThe cowslips tall her pensioners be
p47735
aVIn their gold coats spots you see
p47736
aVThose be rubies fairy favors
p47737
aVIn those freckles live their savors
p47738
aVI must go seek some dewdrops here
p47739
aVAnd hang a pearl in every cowslip\u2019s ear
p47740
aVFarewell thou lob of spirits I\u2019ll be gone
p47741
aVOur queen and all her elves come here anon
p47742
aVThe King doth keep his revels here tonight
p47743
aVTake heed the Queen come not within his sight
p47744
aVFor Oberon is passing fell and wrath
p47745
aVBecause that she as her attendant hath
p47746
aVA lovely boy stolen from an Indian king
p47747
aVShe never had so sweet a changeling
p47748
aVAnd jealous Oberon would have the child
p47749
aVKnight of his train to trace the forests wild
p47750
aVBut she perforce withholds the lovèd boy
p47751
aVCrowns him with flowers and makes him all her joy
p47752
aVAnd now they never meet in grove or green
p47753
aVBy fountain clear or spangled starlight sheen
p47754
aVBut they do square that all their elves for fear
p47755
aVCreep into acorn cups and hide them there
p47756
aVEither I mistake your shape and making quite
p47757
aVOr else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite
p47758
aVCalled Robin Goodfellow Are not you he
p47759
aVThat frights the maidens of the villagery
p47760
aVSkim milk and sometimes labor in the quern
p47761
aVAnd bootless make the breathless huswife churn
p47762
aVAnd sometime make the drink to bear no barm
p47763
aVMislead night wanderers laughing at their harm
p47764
aVThose that Hobgoblin call you and sweet Puck
p47765
aVYou do their work and they shall have good luck
p47766
aVAre not you he
p47767
aVThou speakest aright
p47768
aVI am that merry wanderer of the night
p47769
aVI jest to Oberon and make him smile
p47770
aVWhen I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile
p47771
aVNeighing in likeness of a filly foal
p47772
aVAnd sometime lurk I in a gossip\u2019s bowl
p47773
aVIn very likeness of a roasted crab
p47774
aVAnd when she drinks against her lips I bob
p47775
aVAnd on her withered dewlap pour the ale
p47776
aVThe wisest aunt telling the saddest tale
p47777
aVSometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me
p47778
aVThen slip I from her bum down topples she
p47779
aVAnd Tailor cries and falls into a cough
p47780
aVAnd then the whole choir hold their hips and loffe
p47781
aVAnd waxen in their mirth and neeze and swear
p47782
aVA merrier hour was never wasted there
p47783
aVBut room fairy Here comes Oberon
p47784
aVAnd here my mistress Would that he were gone
p47785
aVIll met by moonlight proud Titania
p47786
aVWhat jealous Oberon Fairies skip hence
p47787
aVI have forsworn his bed and company
p47788
aVTarry rash wanton Am not I thy lord
p47789
aVThen I must be thy lady But I know
p47790
aVWhen thou hast stolen away from Fairyland
p47791
aVAnd in the shape of Corin sat all day
p47792
aVPlaying on pipes of corn and versing love
p47793
aVTo amorous Phillida Why art thou here
p47794
aVCome from the farthest steep of India
p47795
aVBut that forsooth the bouncing Amazon
p47796
aVYour buskined mistress and your warrior love
p47797
aVTo Theseus must be wedded and you come
p47798
aVTo give their bed joy and prosperity
p47799
aVHow canst thou thus for shame Titania
p47800
aVGlance at my credit with Hippolyta
p47801
aVKnowing I know thy love to Theseus
p47802
aVDidst not thou lead him through the glimmering night
p47803
aVFrom Perigouna whom he ravishèd
p47804
aVAnd make him with fair Aegles break his faith
p47805
aVWith Ariadne and Antiopa
p47806
aVThese are the forgeries of jealousy
p47807
aVAnd never since the middle summer\u2019s spring
p47808
aVMet we on hill in dale forest or mead
p47809
aVBy pavèd fountain or by rushy brook
p47810
aVOr in the beachèd margent of the sea
p47811
aVTo dance our ringlets to the whistling wind
p47812
aVBut with thy brawls thou hast disturbed our sport
p47813
aVTherefore the winds piping to us in vain
p47814
aVAs in revenge have sucked up from the sea
p47815
aVContagious fogs which falling in the land
p47816
aVHath every pelting river made so proud
p47817
aVThat they have overborne their continents
p47818
aVThe ox hath therefore stretched his yoke in vain
p47819
aVThe plowman lost his sweat and the green corn
p47820
aVHath rotted ere his youth attained a beard
p47821
aVThe fold stands empty in the drownèd field
p47822
aVAnd crows are fatted with the murrain flock
p47823
aVThe nine-men\u2019s-morris is filled up with mud
p47824
aVAnd the quaint mazes in the wanton green
p47825
aVFor lack of tread are undistinguishable
p47826
aVThe human mortals want their winter here
p47827
aVNo night is now with hymn or carol blessed
p47828
aVTherefore the moon the governess of floods
p47829
aVPale in her anger washes all the air
p47830
aVThat rheumatic diseases do abound
p47831
aVAnd thorough this distemperature we see
p47832
aVThe seasons alter hoary-headed frosts
p47833
aVFall in the fresh lap of the crimson rose
p47834
aVAnd on old Hiems\u2019 thin and icy crown
p47835
aVAn odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds
p47836
aVIs as in mockery set The spring the summer
p47837
aVThe childing autumn angry winter change
p47838
aVTheir wonted liveries and the mazèd world
p47839
aVBy their increase now knows not which is which
p47840
aVAnd this same progeny of evils comes
p47841
aVFrom our debate from our dissension
p47842
aVWe are their parents and original
p47843
aVDo you amend it then It lies in you
p47844
aVWhy should Titania cross her Oberon
p47845
aVI do but beg a little changeling boy
p47846
aVTo be my henchman
p47847
aVSet your heart at rest
p47848
aVThe Fairyland buys not the child of me
p47849
aVHis mother was a vot\u2019ress of my order
p47850
aVAnd in the spicèd Indian air by night
p47851
aVFull often hath she gossiped by my side
p47852
aVAnd sat with me on Neptune\u2019s yellow sands
p47853
aVMarking th\u2019 embarkèd traders on the flood
p47854
aVWhen we have laughed to see the sails conceive
p47855
aVAnd grow big-bellied with the wanton wind
p47856
aVWhich she with pretty and with swimming gait
p47857
aVFollowing her womb then rich with my young squire
p47858
aVWould imitate and sail upon the land
p47859
aVTo fetch me trifles and return again
p47860
aVAs from a voyage rich with merchandise
p47861
aVBut she being mortal of that boy did die
p47862
aVAnd for her sake do I rear up her boy
p47863
aVAnd for her sake I will not part with him
p47864
aVHow long within this wood intend you stay
p47865
aVPerchance till after Theseus\u2019 wedding day
p47866
aVIf you will patiently dance in our round
p47867
aVAnd see our moonlight revels go with us
p47868
aVIf not shun me and I will spare your haunts
p47869
aVGive me that boy and I will go with thee
p47870
aVNot for thy fairy kingdom Fairies away
p47871
aVWe shall chide downright if I longer stay
p47872
aVWell go thy way Thou shalt not from this grove
p47873
aVTill I torment thee for this injury
p47874
aVMy gentle Puck come hither Thou rememb\u2019rest
p47875
aVSince once I sat upon a promontory
p47876
aVAnd heard a mermaid on a dolphin\u2019s back
p47877
aVUttering such dulcet and harmonious breath
p47878
aVThat the rude sea grew civil at her song
p47879
aVAnd certain stars shot madly from their spheres
p47880
aVTo hear the sea-maid\u2019s music
p47881
aVI remember
p47882
aVThat very time I saw but thou couldst not
p47883
aVFlying between the cold moon and the Earth
p47884
aVCupid all armed A certain aim he took
p47885
aVAt a fair vestal thronèd by the west
p47886
aVAnd loosed his love-shaft smartly from his bow
p47887
aVAs it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts
p47888
aVBut I might see young Cupid\u2019s fiery shaft
p47889
aVQuenched in the chaste beams of the wat\u2019ry moon
p47890
aVAnd the imperial vot\u2019ress passèd on
p47891
aVIn maiden meditation fancy-free
p47892
aVYet marked I where the bolt of Cupid fell
p47893
aVIt fell upon a little western flower
p47894
aVBefore milk-white now purple with love\u2019s wound
p47895
aVAnd maidens call it love-in-idleness
p47896
aVFetch me that flower the herb I showed thee once
p47897
aVThe juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid
p47898
aVWill make or man or woman madly dote
p47899
aVUpon the next live creature that it sees
p47900
aVFetch me this herb and be thou here again
p47901
aVEre the leviathan can swim a league
p47902
aVI\u2019ll put a girdle round about the Earth
p47903
aVIn forty minutes
p47904
aVHaving once this juice
p47905
aVI\u2019ll watch Titania when she is asleep
p47906
aVAnd drop the liquor of it in her eyes
p47907
aVThe next thing then she waking looks upon
p47908
aVBe it on lion bear or wolf or bull
p47909
aVOn meddling monkey or on busy ape
p47910
aVShe shall pursue it with the soul of love
p47911
aVAnd ere I take this charm from off her sight
p47912
aVAs I can take it with another herb
p47913
aVI\u2019ll make her render up her page to me
p47914
aVBut who comes here I am invisible
p47915
aVAnd I will overhear their conference
p47916
aVI love thee not therefore pursue me not
p47917
aVWhere is Lysander and fair Hermia
p47918
aVThe one I\u2019ll stay the other stayeth me
p47919
aVThou told\u2019st me they were stol\u2019n unto this wood
p47920
aVAnd here am I and wood within this wood
p47921
aVBecause I cannot meet my Hermia
p47922
aVHence get thee gone and follow me no more
p47923
aVYou draw me you hard-hearted adamant
p47924
aVBut yet you draw not iron for my heart
p47925
aVIs true as steel Leave you your power to draw
p47926
aVAnd I shall have no power to follow you
p47927
aVDo I entice you Do I speak you fair
p47928
aVOr rather do I not in plainest truth
p47929
aVTell you I do not nor I cannot love you
p47930
aVAnd even for that do I love you the more
p47931
aVI am your spaniel and Demetrius
p47932
aVThe more you beat me I will fawn on you
p47933
aVUse me but as your spaniel spurn me strike me
p47934
aVNeglect me lose me only give me leave
p47935
aVUnworthy as I am to follow you
p47936
aVWhat worser place can I beg in your love
p47937
aVAnd yet a place of high respect with me
p47938
aVThan to be usèd as you use your dog
p47939
aVTempt not too much the hatred of my spirit
p47940
aVFor I am sick when I do look on thee
p47941
aVAnd I am sick when I look not on you
p47942
aVYou do impeach your modesty too much
p47943
aVTo leave the city and commit yourself
p47944
aVInto the hands of one that loves you not
p47945
aVTo trust the opportunity of night
p47946
aVAnd the ill counsel of a desert place
p47947
aVWith the rich worth of your virginity
p47948
aVYour virtue is my privilege For that
p47949
aVIt is not night when I do see your face
p47950
aVTherefore I think I am not in the night
p47951
aVNor doth this wood lack worlds of company
p47952
aVFor you in my respect are all the world
p47953
aVThen how can it be said I am alone
p47954
aVWhen all the world is here to look on me
p47955
aVI\u2019ll run from thee and hide me in the brakes
p47956
aVAnd leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts
p47957
aVThe wildest hath not such a heart as you
p47958
aVRun when you will The story shall be changed
p47959
aVApollo flies and Daphne holds the chase
p47960
aVThe dove pursues the griffin the mild hind
p47961
aVMakes speed to catch the tiger Bootless speed
p47962
aVWhen cowardice pursues and valor flies
p47963
aVI will not stay thy questions Let me go
p47964
aVOr if thou follow me do not believe
p47965
aVBut I shall do thee mischief in the wood
p47966
aVAy in the temple in the town the field
p47967
aVYou do me mischief Fie Demetrius
p47968
aVYour wrongs do set a scandal on my sex
p47969
aVWe cannot fight for love as men may do
p47970
aVWe should be wooed and were not made to woo
p47971
aVI\u2019ll follow thee and make a heaven of hell
p47972
aVTo die upon the hand I love so well
p47973
aVFare thee well nymph Ere he do leave this grove
p47974
aVThou shalt fly him and he shall seek thy love
p47975
aVHast thou the flower there Welcome wanderer
p47976
aVAy there it is
p47977
aVI pray thee give it me
p47978
aVI know a bank where the wild thyme blows
p47979
aVWhere oxlips and the nodding violet grows
p47980
aVQuite overcanopied with luscious woodbine
p47981
aVWith sweet muskroses and with eglantine
p47982
aVThere sleeps Titania sometime of the night
p47983
aVLulled in these flowers with dances and delight
p47984
aVAnd there the snake throws her enameled skin
p47985
aVWeed wide enough to wrap a fairy in
p47986
aVAnd with the juice of this I\u2019ll streak her eyes
p47987
aVAnd make her full of hateful fantasies
p47988
aVTake thou some of it and seek through this grove
p47989
aVA sweet Athenian lady is in love
p47990
aVWith a disdainful youth Anoint his eyes
p47991
aVBut do it when the next thing he espies
p47992
aVMay be the lady Thou shalt know the man
p47993
aVBy the Athenian garments he hath on
p47994
aVEffect it with some care that he may prove
p47995
aVMore fond on her than she upon her love
p47996
aVAnd look thou meet me ere the first cock crow
p47997
aVFear not my lord Your servant shall do so
p47998
aVCome now a roundel and a fairy song
p47999
aVThen for the third part of a minute hence
p48000
aVSome to kill cankers in the muskrose buds
p48001
aVSome war with reremice for their leathern wings
p48002
aVTo make my small elves coats and some keep back
p48003
aVThe clamorous owl that nightly hoots and wonders
p48004
aVAt our quaint spirits Sing me now asleep
p48005
aVThen to your offices and let me rest
p48006
aVYou spotted snakes with double tongue

aVWe\u2019ll rest us Hermia if you think it good

aVAnd tarry for the comfort of the day

aVO take the sense sweet of my innocence
p48049
aVLove takes the meaning in love\u2019s conference

aVI mean that my heart unto yours is knit
p48051
aVSo that but one heart we can make of it
p48052
aVTwo bosoms interchainèd with an oath
p48053
aVSo then two bosoms and a single troth
p48054
aVThen by your side no bed-room me deny
p48055
aVFor lying so Hermia I do not lie
p48056
aVLysander riddles very prettily
p48057
aVNow much beshrew my manners and my pride
p48058
aVIf Hermia meant to say Lysander lied
p48059
aVBut gentle friend for love and courtesy
p48060
aVLie further off in human modesty
p48061
aVSuch separation as may well be said
p48062
aVBecomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid

aVSo far be distant and good night sweet friend
p48064
aVThy love ne\u2019er alter till thy sweet life end

aVHere is my bed Sleep give thee all his rest
p48068
aVWith half that wish the wisher\u2019s eyes be pressed
p48069
aVThrough the forest have I gone
p48070
aVBut Athenian found I none
p48071
aVOn whose eyes I might approve
p48072
aVThis flower\u2019s force in stirring love
p48073
aVNight and silence Who is here
p48074
aVWeeds of Athens he doth wear
p48075
aVThis is he my master said
p48076
aVDespisèd the Athenian maid
p48077
aVAnd here the maiden sleeping sound

aVWhen thou wak\u2019st let love forbid
p48084
aVSleep his seat on thy eyelid

aVStay though thou kill me sweet Demetrius
p48088
aVI charge thee hence and do not haunt me thus
p48089
aVO wilt thou darkling leave me Do not so
p48090
aVStay on thy peril I alone will go
p48091
aVO I am out of breath in this fond chase
p48092
aVThe more my prayer the lesser is my grace
p48093
aVHappy is Hermia wheresoe\u2019er she lies
p48094
aVFor she hath blessèd and attractive eyes
p48095
aVHow came her eyes so bright Not with salt tears
p48096
aVIf so my eyes are oftener washed than hers
p48097
aVNo no I am as ugly as a bear
p48098
aVFor beasts that meet me run away for fear
p48099
aVTherefore no marvel though Demetrius
p48100
aVDo as a monster fly my presence thus
p48101
aVWhat wicked and dissembling glass of mine
p48102
aVMade me compare with Hermia\u2019s sphery eyne
p48103
aVBut who is here Lysander on the ground
p48104
aVDead or asleep I see no blood no wound
p48105
aVLysander if you live good sir awake

aVAnd run through fire I will for thy sweet sake
p48107
aVTransparent Helena Nature shows art
p48108
aVThat through thy bosom makes me see thy heart
p48109
aVWhere is Demetrius O how fit a word
p48110
aVIs that vile name to perish on my sword
p48111
aVDo not say so Lysander say not so
p48112
aVWhat though he love your Hermia Lord what though
p48113
aVYet Hermia still loves you Then be content
p48114
aVContent with Hermia No I do repent
p48115
aVThe tedious minutes I with her have spent
p48116
aVNot Hermia but Helena I love
p48117
aVWho will not change a raven for a dove
p48118
aVThe will of man is by his reason swayed
p48119
aVAnd reason says you are the worthier maid
p48120
aVThings growing are not ripe until their season
p48121
aVSo I being young till now ripe not to reason
p48122
aVAnd touching now the point of human skill
p48123
aVReason becomes the marshal to my will
p48124
aVAnd leads me to your eyes where I o\u2019erlook
p48125
aVLove\u2019s stories written in love\u2019s richest book
p48126
aVWherefore was I to this keen mockery born
p48127
aVWhen at your hands did I deserve this scorn
p48128
aVIs \u2019t not enough is \u2019t not enough young man
p48129
aVThat I did never no nor never can
p48130
aVDeserve a sweet look from Demetrius\u2019 eye
p48131
aVBut you must flout my insufficiency
p48132
aVGood troth you do me wrong good sooth you do
p48133
aVIn such disdainful manner me to woo
p48134
aVBut fare you well Perforce I must confess
p48135
aVI thought you lord of more true gentleness

aVAnd left sweet Pyramus translated there

p48258
aVTitania waked and straightway loved an ass
p48259
aVThis falls out better than I could devise
p48260
aVBut hast thou yet latched the Athenian\u2019s eyes
p48261
aVWith the love juice as I did bid thee do
p48262
aVI took him sleeping that is finished too
p48263
aVAnd the Athenian woman by his side

aVThat when he waked of force she must be eyed
p48265
aVStand close This is the same Athenian

aVThis is the woman but not this the man

aVO why rebuke you him that loves you so

aVLay breath so bitter on your bitter foe
p48269
aVNow I but chide but I should use thee worse

aVFor thou I fear hast given me cause to curse
p48271
aVIf thou hast slain Lysander in his sleep
p48272
aVBeing o\u2019er shoes in blood plunge in the deep
p48273
aVAnd kill me too

aVThe sun was not so true unto the day

aVFrom sleeping Hermia I\u2019ll believe as soon
p48277
aVThis whole Earth may be bored and that the moon
p48278
aVMay through the center creep and so displease
p48279
aVHer brother\u2019s noontide with th\u2019 Antipodes
p48280
aVIt cannot be but thou hast murdered him
p48281
aVSo should a murderer look so dead so grim
p48282
aVSo should the murdered look and so should I
p48283
aVPierced through the heart with your stern cruelty
p48284
aVYet you the murderer look as bright as clear
p48285
aVAs yonder Venus in her glimmering sphere
p48286
aVWhat\u2019s this to my Lysander Where is he
p48287
aVAh good Demetrius wilt thou give him me
p48288
aVI had rather give his carcass to my hounds
p48289
aVOut dog Out cur Thou driv\u2019st me past the bounds
p48290
aVOf maiden\u2019s patience Hast thou slain him then
p48291
aVHenceforth be never numbered among men
p48292
aVO once tell true Tell true even for my sake
p48293
aVDurst thou have looked upon him being awake
p48294
aVAnd hast thou killed him sleeping O brave touch
p48295
aVCould not a worm an adder do so much
p48296
aVAn adder did it for with doubler tongue
p48297
aVThan thine thou serpent never adder stung
p48298
aVYou spend your passion on a misprised mood
p48299
aVI am not guilty of Lysander\u2019s blood
p48300
aVNor is he dead for aught that I can tell
p48301
aVI pray thee tell me then that he is well
p48302
aVAn if I could what should I get therefor
p48303
aVA privilege never to see me more
p48304
aVAnd from thy hated presence part I so
p48305
aVSee me no more whether he be dead or no
p48306
aVThere is no following her in this fierce vein
p48307
aVHere therefore for a while I will remain
p48308
aVSo sorrow\u2019s heaviness doth heavier grow
p48309
aVFor debt that bankrout sleep doth sorrow owe
p48310
aVWhich now in some slight measure it will pay
p48311
aVIf for his tender here I make some stay
p48312
aVWhat hast thou done Thou hast mistaken quite
p48313
aVAnd laid the love juice on some true-love\u2019s sight
p48314
aVOf thy misprision must perforce ensue
p48315
aVSome true-love turned and not a false turned true
p48316
aVThen fate o\u2019errules that one man holding troth
p48317
aVA million fail confounding oath on oath
p48318
aVAbout the wood go swifter than the wind
p48319
aVAnd Helena of Athens look thou find
p48320
aVAll fancy-sick she is and pale of cheer
p48321
aVWith sighs of love that costs the fresh blood dear
p48322
aVBy some illusion see thou bring her here
p48323
aVI\u2019ll charm his eyes against she do appear
p48324
aVI go I go look how I go
p48325
aVSwifter than arrow from the Tartar\u2019s bow

p48328
aVSink in apple of his eye

aVShall we their fond pageant see

aVLord what fools these mortals be
p48340
aVStand aside The noise they make
p48341
aVWill cause Demetrius to awake
p48342
aVThen will two at once woo one
p48343
aVThat must needs be sport alone
p48344
aVAnd those things do best please me
p48345
aVThat befall prepost\u2019rously
p48346
aVWhy should you think that I should woo in scorn
p48347
aVScorn and derision never come in tears
p48348
aVLook when I vow I weep and vows so born
p48349
aVIn their nativity all truth appears
p48350
aVHow can these things in me seem scorn to you
p48351
aVBearing the badge of faith to prove them true
p48352
aVYou do advance your cunning more and more
p48353
aVWhen truth kills truth O devilish holy fray
p48354
aVThese vows are Hermia\u2019s Will you give her o\u2019er
p48355
aVWeigh oath with oath and you will nothing weigh
p48356
aVYour vows to her and me put in two scales
p48357
aVWill even weigh and both as light as tales
p48358
aVI had no judgment when to her I swore
p48359
aVNor none in my mind now you give her o\u2019er
p48360
aVDemetrius loves her and he loves not you
p48361

p48365
aVThat pure congealèd white high Taurus\u2019 snow
p48366
aVFanned with the eastern wind turns to a crow
p48367
aVWhen thou hold\u2019st up thy hand O let me kiss
p48368
aVThis princess of pure white this seal of bliss
p48369
aVO spite O hell I see you all are bent
p48370
aVTo set against me for your merriment
p48371
aVIf you were civil and knew courtesy
p48372
aVYou would not do me thus much injury
p48373
aVCan you not hate me as I know you do
p48374
aVBut you must join in souls to mock me too
p48375
aVIf you were men as men you are in show
p48376
aVYou would not use a gentle lady so
p48377
aVTo vow and swear and superpraise my parts
p48378
aVWhen I am sure you hate me with your hearts
p48379
aVYou both are rivals and love Hermia
p48380
aVAnd now both rivals to mock Helena
p48381
aVA trim exploit a manly enterprise
p48382
aVTo conjure tears up in a poor maid\u2019s eyes
p48383
aVWith your derision None of noble sort
p48384
aVWould so offend a virgin and extort
p48385
aVA poor soul\u2019s patience all to make you sport
p48386
aVYou are unkind Demetrius Be not so
p48387
aVFor you love Hermia this you know I know
p48388
aVAnd here with all goodwill with all my heart
p48389
aVIn Hermia\u2019s love I yield you up my part
p48390
aVAnd yours of Helena to me bequeath
p48391
aVWhom I do love and will do till my death
p48392
aVNever did mockers waste more idle breath
p48393
aVLysander keep thy Hermia I will none
p48394
aVIf e\u2019er I loved her all that love is gone
p48395
aVMy heart to her but as guest-wise sojourned
p48396
aVAnd now to Helen is it home returned
p48397
aVThere to remain
p48398
aVHelen it is not so
p48399
aVDisparage not the faith thou dost not know
p48400
aVLest to thy peril thou aby it dear
p48401
aVLook where thy love comes Yonder is thy dear
p48402
aVDark night that from the eye his function takes
p48403
aVThe ear more quick of apprehension makes
p48404
aVWherein it doth impair the seeing sense
p48405
aVIt pays the hearing double recompense
p48406
aVThou art not by mine eye Lysander found
p48407
aVMine ear I thank it brought me to thy sound
p48408
aVBut why unkindly didst thou leave me so
p48409
aVWhy should he stay whom love doth press to go
p48410
aVWhat love could press Lysander from my side
p48411
aVLysander\u2019s love that would not let him bide
p48412
aVFair Helena who more engilds the night
p48413
aVThan all yon fiery oes and eyes of light
p48414
aVWhy seek\u2019st thou me Could not this make thee know
p48415
aVThe hate I bear thee made me leave thee so
p48416
aVYou speak not as you think It cannot be
p48417
aVLo she is one of this confederacy
p48418
aVNow I perceive they have conjoined all three
p48419
aVTo fashion this false sport in spite of me
p48420
aVInjurious Hermia most ungrateful maid
p48421
aVHave you conspired have you with these contrived
p48422
aVTo bait me with this foul derision
p48423
aVIs all the counsel that we two have shared
p48424
aVThe sisters\u2019 vows the hours that we have spent
p48425
aVWhen we have chid the hasty-footed time
p48426
aVFor parting us O is all forgot
p48427
aVAll schooldays\u2019 friendship childhood innocence
p48428
aVWe Hermia like two artificial gods
p48429
aVHave with our needles created both one flower
p48430
aVBoth on one sampler sitting on one cushion
p48431
aVBoth warbling of one song both in one key
p48432
aVAs if our hands our sides voices and minds
p48433
aVHad been incorporate So we grew together
p48434
aVLike to a double cherry seeming parted
p48435
aVBut yet an union in partition
p48436
aVTwo lovely berries molded on one stem
p48437
aVSo with two seeming bodies but one heart
p48438
aVTwo of the first like coats in heraldry
p48439
aVDue but to one and crownèd with one crest
p48440
aVAnd will you rent our ancient love asunder
p48441
aVTo join with men in scorning your poor friend
p48442
aVIt is not friendly \u2019tis not maidenly
p48443
aVOur sex as well as I may chide you for it
p48444
aVThough I alone do feel the injury
p48445
aVI am amazèd at your words
p48446
aVI scorn you not It seems that you scorn me
p48447
aVHave you not set Lysander as in scorn
p48448
aVTo follow me and praise my eyes and face
p48449
aVAnd made your other love Demetrius
p48450
aVWho even but now did spurn me with his foot
p48451
aVTo call me goddess nymph divine and rare
p48452
aVPrecious celestial Wherefore speaks he this
p48453
aVTo her he hates And wherefore doth Lysander
p48454
aVDeny your love so rich within his soul
p48455
aVAnd tender me forsooth affection
p48456
aVBut by your setting on by your consent
p48457
aVWhat though I be not so in grace as you
p48458
aVSo hung upon with love so fortunate
p48459
aVBut miserable most to love unloved
p48460
aVThis you should pity rather than despise
p48461
aVI understand not what you mean by this
p48462
aVAy do Persever counterfeit sad looks
p48463
aVMake mouths upon me when I turn my back
p48464
aVWink each at other hold the sweet jest up
p48465
aVThis sport well carried shall be chronicled
p48466
aVIf you have any pity grace or manners
p48467
aVYou would not make me such an argument
p48468
aVBut fare you well \u2019Tis partly my own fault

p48477
aVHelen I love thee By my life I do
p48478
aVI swear by that which I will lose for thee

p48519
aVImpatient answers from my gentle tongue
p48520
aVFie fie you counterfeit you puppet you
p48521
aVPuppet Why so Ay that way goes the game
p48522
aVNow I perceive that she hath made compare
p48523
aVBetween our statures she hath urged her height
p48524
aVAnd with her personage her tall personage
p48525
aVHer height forsooth she hath prevailed with him
p48526
aVAnd are you grown so high in his esteem
p48527
aVBecause I am so dwarfish and so low
p48528
aVHow low am I thou painted maypole Speak
p48529
aVHow low am I I am not yet so low
p48530
aVBut that my nails can reach unto thine eyes
p48531
aVI pray you though you mock me gentlemen
p48532
aVLet her not hurt me I was never curst
p48533
aVI have no gift at all in shrewishness
p48534
aVI am a right maid for my cowardice
p48535
aVLet her not strike me You perhaps may think
p48536
aVBecause she is something lower than myself
p48537
aVThat I can match her
p48538
aVLower Hark again
p48539
aVGood Hermia do not be so bitter with me
p48540
aVI evermore did love you Hermia
p48541
aVDid ever keep your counsels never wronged you
p48542
aVSave that in love unto Demetrius
p48543
aVI told him of your stealth unto this wood
p48544
aVHe followed you for love I followed him
p48545
aVBut he hath chid me hence and threatened me
p48546
aVTo strike me spurn me nay to kill me too
p48547
aVAnd now so you will let me quiet go
p48548
aVTo Athens will I bear my folly back
p48549
aVAnd follow you no further Let me go
p48550
aVYou see how simple and how fond I am
p48551
aVWhy get you gone Who is \u2019t that hinders you
p48552
aVA foolish heart that I leave here behind
p48553
aVWhat with Lysander
p48554
aVWith Demetrius
p48555
aVBe not afraid She shall not harm thee Helena
p48556
aVNo sir she shall not though you take her part
p48557
aVO when she is angry she is keen and shrewd
p48558
aVShe was a vixen when she went to school
p48559
aVAnd though she be but little she is fierce
p48560
aVLittle again Nothing but low and little
p48561
aVWhy will you suffer her to flout me thus
p48562
aVLet me come to her
p48563
aVGet you gone you dwarf
p48564
aVYou minimus of hind\u2019ring knotgrass made
p48565
aVYou bead you acorn
p48566
aVYou are too officious
p48567
aVIn her behalf that scorns your services
p48568
aVLet her alone Speak not of Helena
p48569
aVTake not her part For if thou dost intend
p48570
aVNever so little show of love to her
p48571
aVThou shalt aby it
p48572
aVNow she holds me not
p48573
aVNow follow if thou dar\u2019st to try whose right
p48574
aVOf thine or mine is most in Helena
p48575
aVFollow Nay I\u2019ll go with thee cheek by jowl
p48576
aVYou mistress all this coil is long of you
p48577
aVNay go not back
p48578
aVI will not trust you I
p48579
aVNor longer stay in your curst company
p48580
aVYour hands than mine are quicker for a fray
p48581
aVMy legs are longer though to run away
p48582
aVI am amazed and know not what to say
p48583
aVThis is thy negligence Still thou mistak\u2019st
p48584
aVOr else committ\u2019st thy knaveries willfully
p48585
aVBelieve me king of shadows I mistook
p48586
aVDid not you tell me I should know the man
p48587
aVBy the Athenian garments he had on
p48588
aVAnd so far blameless proves my enterprise
p48589
aVThat I have \u2019nointed an Athenian\u2019s eyes
p48590
aVAnd so far am I glad it so did sort
p48591
aVAs this their jangling I esteem a sport
p48592
aVThou seest these lovers seek a place to fight
p48593
aVHie therefore Robin overcast the night
p48594
aVThe starry welkin cover thou anon
p48595
aVWith drooping fog as black as Acheron
p48596
aVAnd lead these testy rivals so astray
p48597
aVAs one come not within another\u2019s way
p48598
aVLike to Lysander sometime frame thy tongue
p48599
aVThen stir Demetrius up with bitter wrong
p48600
aVAnd sometime rail thou like Demetrius
p48601
aVAnd from each other look thou lead them thus
p48602
aVTill o\u2019er their brows death-counterfeiting sleep
p48603
aVWith leaden legs and batty wings doth creep
p48604
aVThen crush this herb into Lysander\u2019s eye
p48605
aVWhose liquor hath this virtuous property
p48606
aVTo take from thence all error with his might
p48607
aVAnd make his eyeballs roll with wonted sight
p48608
aVWhen they next wake all this derision
p48609
aVShall seem a dream and fruitless vision
p48610
aVAnd back to Athens shall the lovers wend
p48611
aVWith league whose date till death shall never end
p48612
aVWhiles I in this affair do thee employ
p48613
aVI\u2019ll to my queen and beg her Indian boy
p48614
aVAnd then I will her charmèd eye release
p48615
aVFrom monster\u2019s view and all things shall be peace
p48616
aVMy fairy lord this must be done with haste
p48617
aVFor night\u2019s swift dragons cut the clouds full fast
p48618
aVAnd yonder shines Aurora\u2019s harbinger
p48619
aVAt whose approach ghosts wand\u2019ring here and there
p48620
aVTroop home to churchyards Damnèd spirits all
p48621
aVThat in crossways and floods have burial
p48622
aVAlready to their wormy beds are gone
p48623
aVFor fear lest day should look their shames upon
p48624
aVThey willfully themselves exile from light
p48625
aVAnd must for aye consort with black-browed night
p48626
aVBut we are spirits of another sort
p48627
aVI with the Morning\u2019s love have oft made sport
p48628
aVAnd like a forester the groves may tread
p48629
aVEven till the eastern gate all fiery red
p48630
aVOpening on Neptune with fair blessèd beams
p48631
aVTurns into yellow gold his salt-green streams
p48632
aVBut notwithstanding haste Make no delay
p48633
aVWe may effect this business yet ere day
p48634
aVUp and down up and down
p48635
aVI will lead them up and down
p48636
aVI am feared in field and town
p48637
aVGoblin lead them up and down
p48638
aVHere comes one
p48639
aVWhere art thou proud Demetrius Speak thou now
p48640
aVHere villain drawn and ready Where art thou

aVI will be with thee straight
p48642
aVFollow me then to

aVplainer ground
p48644
aVLysander speak again
p48645
aVThou runaway thou coward art thou fled
p48646
aVSpeak In some bush Where dost thou hide thy head
p48647
aVThou coward art thou bragging to the stars
p48648
aVTelling the bushes that thou look\u2019st for wars
p48649
aVAnd wilt not come Come recreant Come thou child
p48650
aVI\u2019ll whip thee with a rod He is defiled
p48651
aVThat draws a sword on thee
p48652
aVYea art thou there
p48653
aVFollow my voice We\u2019ll try no manhood here
p48654
aVHe goes before me and still dares me on
p48655
aVWhen I come where he calls then he is gone
p48656
aVThe villain is much lighter-heeled than I
p48657
aVI followed fast but faster he did fly
p48658
aVThat fallen am I in dark uneven way
p48659
aVAnd here will rest me Come thou gentle day
p48660
aVFor if but once thou show me thy gray light
p48661
aVI\u2019ll find Demetrius and revenge this spite
p48662
aVHo ho ho Coward why com\u2019st thou not
p48663
aVAbide me if thou dar\u2019st for well I wot
p48664
aVThou runn\u2019st before me shifting every place
p48665
aVAnd dar\u2019st not stand nor look me in the face
p48666
aVWhere art thou now
p48667
aVCome hither I am here
p48668
aVNay then thou mock\u2019st me Thou shalt buy this dear
p48669
aVIf ever I thy face by daylight see
p48670
aVNow go thy way Faintness constraineth me
p48671
aVTo measure out my length on this cold bed
p48672
aVBy day\u2019s approach look to be visited
p48673
aVO weary night O long and tedious night
p48674
aVAbate thy hours Shine comforts from the east
p48675
aVThat I may back to Athens by daylight
p48676
aVFrom these that my poor company detest
p48677
aVAnd sleep that sometimes shuts up sorrow\u2019s eye
p48678
aVSteal me awhile from mine own company
p48679
aVYet but three Come one more
p48680
aVTwo of both kinds makes up four
p48681
aVHere she comes curst and sad
p48682
aVCupid is a knavish lad
p48683
aVThus to make poor females mad
p48684
aVNever so weary never so in woe
p48685
aVBedabbled with the dew and torn with briers
p48686
aVI can no further crawl no further go
p48687
aVMy legs can keep no pace with my desires
p48688
aVHere will I rest me till the break of day
p48689
aVHeavens shield Lysander if they mean a fray
p48690
aVOn the ground
p48691
aVSleep sound
p48692
aVI\u2019ll apply
p48693
aVTo your eye
p48694
aVGentle lover remedy
p48695
aVWhen thou wak\u2019st
p48696
aVThou tak\u2019st
p48697
aVTrue delight
p48698
aVIn the sight
p48699
aVOf thy former lady\u2019s eye
p48700
aVAnd the country proverb known
p48701
aVThat every man should take his own
p48702
aVIn your waking shall be shown
p48703
aVJack shall have Jill
p48704
aVNaught shall go ill
p48705
aVThe man shall have his mare again and all shall be well
p48706
aVCome sit thee down upon this flow\u2019ry bed
p48707
aVWhile I thy amiable cheeks do coy
p48708
aVAnd stick muskroses in thy sleek smooth head
p48709
aVAnd kiss thy fair large ears my gentle joy
p48710
aVWhat wilt thou hear some music my sweet love
p48711
aVOr say sweet love what thou desirest to eat
p48712
aVI have a venturous fairy that shall seek
p48713
aVThe squirrel\u2019s hoard and fetch thee new nuts
p48714
aVSleep thou and I will wind thee in my arms
p48715
aVFairies begone and be all ways away
p48716
aVSo doth the woodbine the sweet honeysuckle
p48717
aVGently entwist the female ivy so
p48718
aVEnrings the barky fingers of the elm
p48719
aVO how I love thee How I dote on thee
p48720
aVWelcome good Robin Seest thou this sweet sight
p48721
aVHer dotage now I do begin to pity
p48722
aVFor meeting her of late behind the wood
p48723
aVSeeking sweet favors for this hateful fool
p48724
aVI did upbraid her and fall out with her
p48725
aVFor she his hairy temples then had rounded
p48726
aVWith coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers
p48727
aVAnd that same dew which sometime on the buds
p48728
aVWas wont to swell like round and orient pearls
p48729
aVStood now within the pretty flouriets\u2019 eyes
p48730
aVLike tears that did their own disgrace bewail
p48731
aVWhen I had at my pleasure taunted her
p48732
aVAnd she in mild terms begged my patience
p48733
aVI then did ask of her her changeling child
p48734
aVWhich straight she gave me and her fairy sent
p48735
aVTo bear him to my bower in Fairyland
p48736
aVAnd now I have the boy I will undo
p48737
aVThis hateful imperfection of her eyes
p48738
aVAnd gentle Puck take this transformèd scalp
p48739
aVFrom off the head of this Athenian swain
p48740
aVThat he awaking when the other do
p48741
aVMay all to Athens back again repair
p48742
aVAnd think no more of this night\u2019s accidents
p48743
aVBut as the fierce vexation of a dream
p48744
aVBut first I will release the Fairy Queen
p48745
aVBe as thou wast wont to be
p48746
aVSee as thou wast wont to see
p48747
aVDian\u2019s bud o\u2019er Cupid\u2019s flower
p48748
aVHath such force and blessèd power
p48749
aVNow my Titania wake you my sweet queen
p48750
aVMy Oberon what visions have I seen
p48751
aVMethought I was enamored of an ass
p48752
aVThere lies your love
p48753
aVHow came these things to pass
p48754
aVO how mine eyes do loathe his visage now
p48755
aVSilence awhile Robin take off this head
p48756
aVTitania music call and strike more dead
p48757
aVThan common sleep of all these five the sense
p48758
aVMusic ho music such as charmeth sleep
p48759
aVNow when thou wak\u2019st with thine own fool\u2019s eyes peep
p48760
aVSound music
p48761
aVCome my queen take hands with me
p48762
aVAnd rock the ground whereon these sleepers be
p48763
aVNow thou and I are new in amity
p48764
aVAnd will tomorrow midnight solemnly
p48765
aVDance in Duke Theseus\u2019 house triumphantly
p48766
aVAnd bless it to all fair prosperity
p48767
aVThere shall the pairs of faithful lovers be
p48768
aVWedded with Theseus all in jollity
p48769
aVFairy king attend and mark
p48770
aVI do hear the morning lark
p48771
aVThen my queen in silence sad
p48772
aVTrip we after night\u2019s shade
p48773
aVWe the globe can compass soon
p48774
aVSwifter than the wand\u2019ring moon
p48775
aVCome my lord and in our flight
p48776
aVTell me how it came this night
p48777
aVThat I sleeping here was found
p48778
aVWith these mortals on the ground
p48779
aVGo one of you find out the Forester
p48780
aVFor now our observation is performed
p48781
aVAnd since we have the vaward of the day
p48782
aVMy love shall hear the music of my hounds
p48783
aVUncouple in the western valley let them go
p48784
aVDispatch I say and find the Forester
p48785
aVWe will fair queen up to the mountain\u2019s top
p48786
aVAnd mark the musical confusion
p48787
aVOf hounds and echo in conjunction
p48788
aVI was with Hercules and Cadmus once
p48789
aVWhen in a wood of Crete they bayed the bear
p48790
aVWith hounds of Sparta Never did I hear
p48791
aVSuch gallant chiding for besides the groves
p48792
aVThe skies the fountains every region near
p48793
aVSeemed all one mutual cry I never heard
p48794
aVSo musical a discord such sweet thunder
p48795
aVMy hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind
p48796
aVSo flewed so sanded and their heads are hung
p48797
aVWith ears that sweep away the morning dew
p48798
aVCrook-kneed and dewlapped like Thessalian bulls
p48799
aVSlow in pursuit but matched in mouth like bells
p48800
aVEach under each A cry more tunable
p48801
aVWas never holloed to nor cheered with horn
p48802
aVIn Crete in Sparta nor in Thessaly
p48803
aVJudge when you hear But soft What nymphs are these
p48804
aVMy lord this is my daughter here asleep
p48805
aVAnd this Lysander this Demetrius is
p48806
aVThis Helena old Nedar\u2019s Helena
p48807
aVI wonder of their being here together
p48808
aVNo doubt they rose up early to observe
p48809
aVThe rite of May and hearing our intent
p48810
aVCame here in grace of our solemnity
p48811
aVBut speak Egeus Is not this the day
p48812
aVThat Hermia should give answer of her choice
p48813
aVIt is my lord
p48814
aVGo bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns
p48815
aVGood morrow friends Saint Valentine is past
p48816
aVBegin these woodbirds but to couple now
p48817
aVPardon my lord
p48818
aVI pray you all stand up
p48819
aVI know you two are rival enemies
p48820
aVHow comes this gentle concord in the world
p48821
aVThat hatred is so far from jealousy
p48822
aVTo sleep by hate and fear no enmity
p48823
aVMy lord I shall reply amazèdly
p48824
aVHalf sleep half waking But as yet I swear
p48825
aVI cannot truly say how I came here
p48826
aVBut as I think for truly would I speak
p48827
aVAnd now I do bethink me so it is
p48828
aVI came with Hermia hither Our intent
p48829
aVWas to be gone from Athens where we might
p48830
aVWithout the peril of the Athenian law
p48831
aVEnough enough My lord you have enough
p48832
aVI beg the law the law upon his head
p48833
aVThey would have stol\u2019n away They would Demetrius
p48834
aVThereby to have defeated you and me
p48835
aVYou of your wife and me of my consent
p48836
aVOf my consent that she should be your wife
p48837
aVMy lord fair Helen told me of their stealth
p48838
aVOf this their purpose hither to this wood
p48839
aVAnd I in fury hither followed them
p48840
aVFair Helena in fancy following me
p48841
aVBut my good lord I wot not by what power
p48842
aVBut by some power it is my love to Hermia
p48843
aVMelted as the snow seems to me now
p48844
aVAs the remembrance of an idle gaud
p48845
aVWhich in my childhood I did dote upon
p48846
aVAnd all the faith the virtue of my heart
p48847
aVThe object and the pleasure of mine eye
p48848
aVIs only Helena To her my lord
p48849
aVWas I betrothed ere I saw Hermia
p48850
aVBut like a sickness did I loathe this food
p48851
aVBut as in health come to my natural taste
p48852
aVNow I do wish it love it long for it
p48853
aVAnd will forevermore be true to it
p48854
aVFair lovers you are fortunately met
p48855
aVOf this discourse we more will hear anon
p48856
aVEgeus I will overbear your will
p48857
aVFor in the temple by and by with us
p48858
aVThese couples shall eternally be knit
p48859
aVAnd for the morning now is something worn
p48860
aVOur purposed hunting shall be set aside
p48861
aVAway with us to Athens Three and three
p48862
aVWe\u2019ll hold a feast in great solemnity
p48863
aVCome Hippolyta
p48864
aVThese things seem small and undistinguishable
p48865
aVLike far-off mountains turnèd into clouds
p48866
aVMethinks I see these things with parted eye
p48867
aVWhen everything seems double
p48868
aVSo methinks
p48869
aVAnd I have found Demetrius like a jewel
p48870
aVMine own and not mine own
p48871
aVAre you sure
p48872
aVThat we are awake It seems to me
p48873
aVThat yet we sleep we dream Do not you think
p48874
aVThe Duke was here and bid us follow him
p48875
aVYea and my father
p48876
aVAnd Hippolyta
p48877
aVAnd he did bid us follow to the temple
p48878
aVWhy then we are awake Let\u2019s follow him
p48879
aVAnd by the way let us recount our dreams
p48880
aV\u2019Tis strange my Theseus that these lovers speak of
p48881
aVMore strange than true I never may believe
p48882
aVThese antique fables nor these fairy toys
p48883
aVLovers and madmen have such seething brains
p48884
aVSuch shaping fantasies that apprehend
p48885
aVMore than cool reason ever comprehends
p48886
aVThe lunatic the lover and the poet
p48887
aVAre of imagination all compact
p48888
aVOne sees more devils than vast hell can hold
p48889
aVThat is the madman The lover all as frantic
p48890
aVSees Helen\u2019s beauty in a brow of Egypt
p48891
aVThe poet\u2019s eye in a fine frenzy rolling
p48892
aVDoth glance from heaven to Earth from Earth to heaven
p48893
aVAnd as imagination bodies forth
p48894
aVThe forms of things unknown the poet\u2019s pen
p48895
aVTurns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing
p48896
aVA local habitation and a name
p48897
aVSuch tricks hath strong imagination
p48898
aVThat if it would but apprehend some joy
p48899
aVIt comprehends some bringer of that joy
p48900
aVOr in the night imagining some fear
p48901
aVHow easy is a bush supposed a bear
p48902
aVBut all the story of the night told over
p48903
aVAnd all their minds transfigured so together
p48904
aVMore witnesseth than fancy\u2019s images
p48905
aVAnd grows to something of great constancy
p48906
aVBut howsoever strange and admirable
p48907
aVHere come the lovers full of joy and mirth
p48908
aVJoy gentle friends Joy and fresh days of love
p48909
aVAccompany your hearts
p48910
aVMore than to us
p48911
aVWait in your royal walks your board your bed
p48912
aVCome now what masques what dances shall we have
p48913
aVTo wear away this long age of three hours
p48914
aVBetween our after-supper and bedtime
p48915
aVWhere is our usual manager of mirth
p48916
aVWhat revels are in hand Is there no play
p48917
aVTo ease the anguish of a torturing hour
p48918
aVCall Philostrate
p48919
aVHere mighty Theseus
p48920
aVSay what abridgment have you for this evening
p48921
aVWhat masque what music How shall we beguile
p48922
aVThe lazy time if not with some delight
p48923
aVThere is a brief how many sports are ripe
p48924
aVMake choice of which your Highness will see first
p48925
aVThe battle with the Centaurs to be sung
p48926
aVBy an Athenian eunuch to the harp
p48927
aVWe\u2019ll none of that That have I told my love
p48928
aVIn glory of my kinsman Hercules
p48929
aVThe riot of the tipsy Bacchanals
p48930
aVTearing the Thracian singer in their rage
p48931
aVThat is an old device and it was played
p48932
aVWhen I from Thebes came last a conqueror
p48933
aVThe thrice-three Muses mourning for the death
p48934
aVOf learning late deceased in beggary
p48935
aVThat is some satire keen and critical
p48936
aVNot sorting with a nuptial ceremony
p48937
aVA tedious brief scene of young Pyramus
p48938
aVAnd his love Thisbe very tragical mirth
p48939
aVMerry and tragical Tedious and brief
p48940
aVThat is hot ice and wondrous strange snow
p48941
aVHow shall we find the concord of this discord
p48942
aVA play there is my lord some ten words long
p48943
aVWhich is as brief as I have known a play
p48944
aVBut by ten words my lord it is too long
p48945
aVWhich makes it tedious for in all the play
p48946
aVThere is not one word apt one player fitted
p48947
aVAnd tragical my noble lord it is
p48948
aVFor Pyramus therein doth kill himself
p48949
aVWhich when I saw rehearsed I must confess
p48950
aVMade mine eyes water but more merry tears
p48951
aVThe passion of loud laughter never shed
p48952
aVWhat are they that do play it
p48953
aVHard-handed men that work in Athens here
p48954
aVWhich never labored in their minds till now
p48955
aVAnd now have toiled their unbreathed memories
p48956
aVWith this same play against your nuptial
p48957
aVAnd we will hear it
p48958
aVNo my noble lord
p48959
aVIt is not for you I have heard it over
p48960
aVAnd it is nothing nothing in the world
p48961
aVUnless you can find sport in their intents
p48962
aVExtremely stretched and conned with cruel pain
p48963
aVTo do you service
p48964
aVI will hear that play
p48965
aVFor never anything can be amiss
p48966
aVWhen simpleness and duty tender it
p48967
aVGo bring them in and take your places ladies
p48968
aVI love not to see wretchedness o\u2019ercharged
p48969
aVAnd duty in his service perishing
p48970
aVWhy gentle sweet you shall see no such thing
p48971
aVHe says they can do nothing in this kind
p48972
aVThe kinder we to give them thanks for nothing
p48973
aVOur sport shall be to take what they mistake
p48974
aVAnd what poor duty cannot do noble respect
p48975
aVTakes it in might not merit
p48976
aVWhere I have come great clerks have purposèd
p48977
aVTo greet me with premeditated welcomes
p48978
aVWhere I have seen them shiver and look pale
p48979
aVMake periods in the midst of sentences
p48980
aVThrottle their practiced accent in their fears
p48981
aVAnd in conclusion dumbly have broke off
p48982
aVNot paying me a welcome Trust me sweet
p48983
aVOut of this silence yet I picked a welcome
p48984
aVAnd in the modesty of fearful duty
p48985
aVI read as much as from the rattling tongue
p48986
aVOf saucy and audacious eloquence
p48987
aVLove therefore and tongue-tied simplicity
p48988
aVIn least speak most to my capacity
p48989
aVSo please your Grace the Prologue is addressed
p48990
aVLet him approach
p48991
aVIf we offend it is with our goodwill
p48992
aVThat you should think we come not to offend
p48993
aVBut with goodwill To show our simple skill
p48994
aVThat is the true beginning of our end
p48995
aVConsider then we come but in despite
p48996
aVWe do not come as minding to content you
p48997
aVOur true intent is All for your delight
p48998
aVWe are not here That you should here repent you
p48999
aVThe actors are at hand and by their show
p49000
aVYou shall know all that you are like to know
p49001
aVGentles perchance you wonder at this show
p49002
aVBut wonder on till truth make all things plain
p49003
aVThis man is Pyramus if you would know
p49004
aVThis beauteous lady Thisbe is certain
p49005
aVThis man with lime and roughcast doth present
p49006
aVWall that vile wall which did these lovers sunder
p49007
aVAnd through Wall\u2019s chink poor souls they are content
p49008
aVTo whisper at the which let no man wonder
p49009
aVThis man with lantern dog and bush of thorn
p49010
aVPresenteth Moonshine for if you will know
p49011
aVBy moonshine did these lovers think no scorn
p49012
aVTo meet at Ninus\u2019 tomb there there to woo
p49013
aVThis grisly beast which Lion hight by name
p49014
aVThe trusty Thisbe coming first by night
p49015
aVDid scare away or rather did affright
p49016
aVAnd as she fled her mantle she did fall
p49017
aVWhich Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain
p49018
aVAnon comes Pyramus sweet youth and tall
p49019
aVAnd finds his trusty Thisbe\u2019s mantle slain
p49020
aVWhereat with blade with bloody blameful blade
p49021
aVHe bravely broached his boiling bloody breast
p49022
aVAnd Thisbe tarrying in mulberry shade
p49023
aVHis dagger drew and died For all the rest
p49024
aVLet Lion Moonshine Wall and lovers twain
p49025
aVAt large discourse while here they do remain
p49026
aVIn this same interlude it doth befall
p49027
aVThat I one Snout by name present a wall
p49028
aVAnd such a wall as I would have you think
p49029
aVThat had in it a crannied hole or chink
p49030
aVThrough which the lovers Pyramus and Thisbe
p49031
aVDid whisper often very secretly
p49032
aVThis loam this roughcast and this stone doth show
p49033
aVThat I am that same wall The truth is so
p49034
aVAnd this the cranny is right and sinister
p49035
aVThrough which the fearful lovers are to whisper
p49036
aVO grim-looked night O night with hue so black
p49037
aVO night which ever art when day is not
p49038
aVO night O night Alack alack alack
p49039
aVI fear my Thisbe\u2019s promise is forgot
p49040
aVAnd thou O wall O sweet O lovely wall
p49041
aVThat stand\u2019st between her father\u2019s ground and mine
p49042
aVThou wall O wall O sweet and lovely wall
p49043
aVShow me thy chink to blink through with mine eyne
p49044
aVThanks courteous wall Jove shield thee well for this
p49045
aVBut what see I No Thisbe do I see
p49046
aVO wicked wall through whom I see no bliss
p49047
aVCursed be thy stones for thus deceiving me
p49048
aVO wall full often hast thou heard my moans
p49049
aVFor parting my fair Pyramus and me
p49050
aVMy cherry lips have often kissed thy stones
p49051
aVThy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee
p49052
aVI see a voice Now will I to the chink
p49053
aVTo spy an I can hear my Thisbe\u2019s face
p49054
aVThisbe
p49055
aVMy love Thou art my love I think
p49056
aVThink what thou wilt I am thy lover\u2019s grace
p49057
aVAnd like Limander am I trusty still
p49058
aVAnd I like Helen till the Fates me kill
p49059
aVNot Shafalus to Procrus was so true
p49060
aVAs Shafalus to Procrus I to you
p49061
aVO kiss me through the hole of this vile wall
p49062
aVI kiss the wall\u2019s hole not your lips at all
p49063
aVWilt thou at Ninny\u2019s tomb meet me straightway
p49064
aV\u2019Tide life \u2019tide death I come without delay
p49065
aVThus have I Wall my part dischargèd so
p49066
aVAnd being done thus Wall away doth go
p49067
aVYou ladies you whose gentle hearts do fear
p49068
aVThe smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor
p49069
aVMay now perchance both quake and tremble here
p49070
aVWhen lion rough in wildest rage doth roar
p49071
aVThen know that I as Snug the joiner am
p49072
aVA lion fell nor else no lion\u2019s dam
p49073
aVFor if I should as lion come in strife
p49074
aVInto this place \u2019twere pity on my life
p49075
aVThis lanthorn doth the hornèd moon present
p49076
aVThis lanthorn doth the hornèd moon present
p49077
aVMyself the man i\u2019 th\u2019 moon do seem to be
p49078
aVThis is old Ninny\u2019s tomb Where is my love
p49079
aVSweet Moon I thank thee for thy sunny beams
p49080
aVI thank thee Moon for shining now so bright
p49081
aVFor by thy gracious golden glittering gleams
p49082
aVI trust to take of truest Thisbe sight

aVBut stay O spite

aVLovers to bed \u2019Tis almost fairy time
p49137
aVI fear we shall outsleep the coming morn
p49138
aVAs much as we this night have overwatched
p49139
aVThis palpable-gross play hath well beguiled
p49140
aVThe heavy gait of night Sweet friends to bed
p49141
aVA fortnight hold we this solemnity
p49142
aVIn nightly revels and new jollity
p49143
aVNow the hungry lion roars
p49144
aVAnd the wolf behowls the moon
p49145
aVWhilst the heavy plowman snores
p49146
aVAll with weary task fordone
p49147
aVNow the wasted brands do glow
p49148
aVWhilst the screech-owl screeching loud
p49149
aVPuts the wretch that lies in woe
p49150
aVIn remembrance of a shroud
p49151
aVNow it is the time of night
p49152
aVThat the graves all gaping wide
p49153
aVEvery one lets forth his sprite
p49154
aVIn the church-way paths to glide
p49155
aVAnd we fairies that do run
p49156
aVBy the triple Hecate\u2019s team
p49157
aVFrom the presence of the sun
p49158
aVFollowing darkness like a dream
p49159
aVNow are frolic Not a mouse
p49160
aVShall disturb this hallowed house
p49161
aVI am sent with broom before
p49162
aVTo sweep the dust behind the door
p49163
aVThrough the house give glimmering light
p49164
aVBy the dead and drowsy fire
p49165
aVEvery elf and fairy sprite
p49166
aVHop as light as bird from brier
p49167
aVAnd this ditty after me

aVSing and dance it trippingly
p49169
aVFirst rehearse your song by rote
p49170
aVTo each word a warbling note
p49171
aVHand in hand with fairy grace
p49172
aVWill we sing and bless this place
p49173
aVNow until the break of day

aVThrough this house each fairy stray
p49175
aVTo the best bride-bed will we

aVSo shall all the couples three

aVDespisèd in nativity
p49186
aVShall upon their children be

aVEvery fairy take his gait
p49189
aVAnd each several chamber bless

aVMeet me all by break of day
p49195
aVIf we shadows have offended
p49196
aVThink but this and all is mended
p49197
aVThat you have but slumbered here
p49198
aVWhile these visions did appear
p49199
aVAnd this weak and idle theme
p49200
aVNo more yielding but a dream
p49201
aVGentles do not reprehend
p49202
aVIf you pardon we will mend
p49203
aVAnd as I am an honest Puck
p49204
aVIf we have unearnèd luck
p49205
aVNow to \u2019scape the serpent\u2019s tongue
p49206
aVWe will make amends ere long
p49207
aVElse the Puck a liar call
p49208
aVSo good night unto you all
p49209
aVGive me your hands if we be friends
p49210
aVAnd Robin shall restore amends
p49211
aVIn sooth I know not why I am so sad
p49212
aVIt wearies me you say it wearies you
p49213
aVBut how I caught it found it or came by it
p49214
aVWhat stuff \u2019tis made of whereof it is born
p49215
aVI am to learn
p49216
aVAnd such a want-wit sadness makes of me
p49217
aVThat I have much ado to know myself
p49218
aVYour mind is tossing on the ocean
p49219
aVThere where your argosies with portly sail
p49220
aVLike signiors and rich burghers on the flood
p49221
aVOr as it were the pageants of the sea
p49222
aVDo overpeer the petty traffickers
p49223
aVThat curtsy to them do them reverence
p49224
aVAs they fly by them with their woven wings
p49225
aVBelieve me sir had I such venture forth
p49226
aVThe better part of my affections would
p49227
aVBe with my hopes abroad I should be still
p49228
aVPlucking the grass to know where sits the wind
p49229
aVPiring in maps for ports and piers and roads
p49230
aVAnd every object that might make me fear
p49231
aVMisfortune to my ventures out of doubt
p49232
aVWould make me sad
p49233
aVMy wind cooling my broth
p49234
aVWould blow me to an ague when I thought
p49235
aVWhat harm a wind too great might do at sea
p49236
aVI should not see the sandy hourglass run
p49237
aVBut I should think of shallows and of flats
p49238
aVAnd see my wealthy Andrew docked in sand
p49239
aVVailing her high top lower than her ribs
p49240
aVTo kiss her burial Should I go to church
p49241
aVAnd see the holy edifice of stone
p49242
aVAnd not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks
p49243
aVWhich touching but my gentle vessel\u2019s side
p49244
aVWould scatter all her spices on the stream
p49245
aVEnrobe the roaring waters with my silks
p49246
aVAnd in a word but even now worth this
p49247
aVAnd now worth nothing Shall I have the thought
p49248
aVTo think on this and shall I lack the thought
p49249
aVThat such a thing bechanced would make me sad
p49250
aVBut tell not me I know Antonio
p49251
aVIs sad to think upon his merchandise
p49252
aVBelieve me no I thank my fortune for it
p49253
aVMy ventures are not in one bottom trusted
p49254
aVNor to one place nor is my whole estate
p49255
aVUpon the fortune of this present year
p49256
aVTherefore my merchandise makes me not sad
p49257
aVWhy then you are in love
p49258
aVFie fie
p49259
aVNot in love neither Then let us say you are sad
p49260
aVBecause you are not merry and \u2019twere as easy
p49261
aVFor you to laugh and leap and say you are merry
p49262
aVBecause you are not sad Now by two-headed Janus
p49263
aVNature hath framed strange fellows in her time
p49264
aVSome that will evermore peep through their eyes
p49265
aVAnd laugh like parrots at a bagpiper
p49266
aVAnd other of such vinegar aspect
p49267
aVThat they\u2019ll not show their teeth in way of smile
p49268
aVThough Nestor swear the jest be laughable
p49269
aVHere comes Bassanio your most noble kinsman
p49270
aVGratiano and Lorenzo Fare you well
p49271
aVWe leave you now with better company
p49272
aVI would have stayed till I had made you merry
p49273
aVIf worthier friends had not prevented me
p49274
aVYour worth is very dear in my regard
p49275
aVI take it your own business calls on you
p49276
aVAnd you embrace th\u2019 occasion to depart
p49277
aVGood morrow my good lords
p49278
aVGood signiors both when shall we laugh Say when
p49279
aVYou grow exceeding strange Must it be so
p49280
aVWe\u2019ll make our leisures to attend on yours
p49281
aVMy Lord Bassanio since you have found Antonio
p49282
aVWe two will leave you But at dinner time
p49283
aVI pray you have in mind where we must meet
p49284
aVI will not fail you
p49285
aVYou look not well Signior Antonio
p49286
aVYou have too much respect upon the world
p49287
aVThey lose it that do buy it with much care
p49288
aVBelieve me you are marvelously changed
p49289
aVI hold the world but as the world Gratiano
p49290
aVA stage where every man must play a part
p49291
aVAnd mine a sad one
p49292
aVLet me play the fool
p49293
aVWith mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come
p49294
aVAnd let my liver rather heat with wine
p49295
aVThan my heart cool with mortifying groans
p49296
aVWhy should a man whose blood is warm within
p49297
aVSit like his grandsire cut in alabaster
p49298
aVSleep when he wakes And creep into the jaundice
p49299
aVBy being peevish I tell thee what Antonio
p49300
aVI love thee and \u2019tis my love that speaks
p49301
aVThere are a sort of men whose visages
p49302
aVDo cream and mantle like a standing pond
p49303
aVAnd do a willful stillness entertain
p49304
aVWith purpose to be dressed in an opinion
p49305
aVOf wisdom gravity profound conceit
p49306
aVAs who should say I am Sir Oracle
p49307
aVAnd when I ope my lips let no dog bark
p49308
aVO my Antonio I do know of these
p49309
aVThat therefore only are reputed wise
p49310
aVFor saying nothing when I am very sure
p49311
aVIf they should speak would almost damn those ears
p49312
aVWhich hearing them would call their brothers fools
p49313
aVI\u2019ll tell thee more of this another time
p49314
aVBut fish not with this melancholy bait
p49315
aVFor this fool gudgeon this opinion
p49316
aVCome good Lorenzo Fare you well a while
p49317
aVI\u2019ll end my exhortation after dinner
p49318
aVWell we will leave you then till dinner time
p49319
aVI must be one of these same dumb wise men
p49320
aVFor Gratiano never lets me speak

aVThe skillful shepherd pilled me certain wands
p49443
aVAnd in the doing of the deed of kind
p49444
aVHe stuck them up before the fulsome ewes
p49445
aVWho then conceiving did in eaning time
p49446
aVFall parti-colored lambs and those were Jacob\u2019s
p49447
aVThis was a way to thrive and he was blest
p49448
aVAnd thrift is blessing if men steal it not
p49449
aVThis was a venture sir that Jacob served for
p49450

aVOnly my blood speaks to you in my veins
p50213
aVAnd there is such confusion in my powers

aVI freely told you all the wealth I had

p50306
aVOf merchant-marring rocks
p50307
aVNot one my lord
p50308
aVBesides it should appear that if he had
p50309
aVThe present money to discharge the Jew
p50310
aVHe would not take it Never did I know
p50311
aVA creature that did bear the shape of man
p50312
aVSo keen and greedy to confound a man
p50313
aVHe plies the Duke at morning and at night
p50314
aVAnd doth impeach the freedom of the state
p50315
aVIf they deny him justice Twenty merchants
p50316
aVThe Duke himself and the magnificoes
p50317
aVOf greatest port have all persuaded with him
p50318
aVBut none can drive him from the envious plea
p50319
aVOf forfeiture of justice and his bond
p50320
aVWhen I was with him I have heard him swear
p50321
aVTo Tubal and to Chus his countrymen
p50322
aVThat he would rather have Antonio\u2019s flesh
p50323
aVThan twenty times the value of the sum
p50324
aVThat he did owe him And I know my lord
p50325
aVIf law authority and power deny not

aVIn doing courtesies and one in whom

aVThe ancient Roman honor more appears
p50332
aVThan any that draws breath in Italy
p50333
aVWhat sum owes he the Jew
p50334
aVFor me three thousand ducats
p50335
aVWhat no more
p50336
aVPay him six thousand and deface the bond
p50337
aVDouble six thousand and then treble that
p50338
aVBefore a friend of this description
p50339
aVShall lose a hair through Bassanio\u2019s fault
p50340
aVFirst go with me to church and call me wife
p50341
aVAnd then away to Venice to your friend
p50342
aVFor never shall you lie by Portia\u2019s side
p50343
aVWith an unquiet soul You shall have gold
p50344
aVTo pay the petty debt twenty times over
p50345
aVWhen it is paid bring your true friend along

aVNo bed shall e\u2019er be guilty of my stay
p50356
aVNor rest be interposer \u2019twixt us twain

p50358
aVThis is the fool that lent out money gratis

aVJailer look to him
p50360
aVHear me yet good Shylock
p50361
aVI\u2019ll have my bond Speak not against my bond
p50362
aVI have sworn an oath that I will have my bond
p50363
aVThou call\u2019dst me dog before thou hadst a cause
p50364
aVBut since I am a dog beware my fangs
p50365
aVThe Duke shall grant me justice I do wonder
p50366
aVThou naughty jailer that thou art so fond
p50367
aVTo come abroad with him at his request
p50368
aVI pray thee hear me speak
p50369
aVI\u2019ll have my bond I will not hear thee speak
p50370
aVI\u2019ll have my bond and therefore speak no more
p50371
aVI\u2019ll not be made a soft and dull-eyed fool
p50372
aVTo shake the head relent and sigh and yield
p50373
aVTo Christian intercessors Follow not
p50374
aVI\u2019ll have no speaking I will have my bond
p50375
aVIt is the most impenetrable cur
p50376
aVThat ever kept with men
p50377
aVLet him alone
p50378
aVI\u2019ll follow him no more with bootless prayers
p50379
aVHe seeks my life His reason well I know
p50380
aVI oft delivered from his forfeitures
p50381
aVMany that have at times made moan to me
p50382
aVTherefore he hates me
p50383
aVI am sure the Duke
p50384
aVWill never grant this forfeiture to hold
p50385
aVThe Duke cannot deny the course of law
p50386
aVFor the commodity that strangers have
p50387
aVWith us in Venice if it be denied
p50388
aVWill much impeach the justice of the state
p50389
aVSince that the trade and profit of the city
p50390
aVConsisteth of all nations Therefore go
p50391
aVThese griefs and losses have so bated me
p50392
aVThat I shall hardly spare a pound of flesh
p50393
aVTomorrow to my bloody creditor
p50394
aVWell jailer on Pray God Bassanio come
p50395
aVTo see me pay his debt and then I care not
p50396
aVMadam although I speak it in your presence
p50397
aVYou have a noble and a true conceit
p50398
aVOf godlike amity which appears most strongly
p50399
aVIn bearing thus the absence of your lord
p50400
aVBut if you knew to whom you show this honor
p50401
aVHow true a gentleman you send relief
p50402
aVHow dear a lover of my lord your husband
p50403
aVI know you would be prouder of the work
p50404
aVThan customary bounty can enforce you
p50405
aVI never did repent for doing good
p50406
aVNor shall not now for in companions
p50407
aVThat do converse and waste the time together
p50408
aVWhose souls do bear an equal yoke of love
p50409
aVThere must be needs a like proportion
p50410
aVOf lineaments of manners and of spirit
p50411
aVWhich makes me think that this Antonio
p50412
aVBeing the bosom lover of my lord
p50413
aVMust needs be like my lord If it be so
p50414
aVHow little is the cost I have bestowed
p50415
aVIn purchasing the semblance of my soul
p50416
aVFrom out the state of hellish cruelty
p50417
aVThis comes too near the praising of myself
p50418
aVTherefore no more of it Hear other things

aVLorenzo I commit into your hands

aVAnd speak between the change of man and boy
p50464
aVWith a reed voice and turn two mincing steps
p50465
aVInto a manly stride and speak of frays

aVAnd if on Earth he do not merit it
p50496
aVIn reason he should never come to heaven
p50497
aVWhy if two gods should play some heavenly match
p50498
aVAnd on the wager lay two earthly women
p50499
aVAnd Portia one there must be something else

aVOut of his envy\u2019s reach I do oppose
p50520
aVMy patience to his fury and am armed
p50521
aVTo suffer with a quietness of spirit

aVTo the last hour of act and then \u2019tis thought
p50529
aVThou \u2019lt show thy mercy and remorse more strange

p50549
aVYou\u2019ll ask me why I rather choose to have

aVAs to offend himself being offended

p50629
aVCame you from Padua from Bellario
p50630
aVFrom both my lord Bellario greets your Grace
p50631
aVWhy dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly
p50632
aVTo cut the forfeiture from that bankrout there
p50633
aVNot on thy sole but on thy soul harsh Jew
p50634
aVThou mak\u2019st thy knife keen But no metal can
p50635
aVNo not the hangman\u2019s axe bear half the keenness
p50636
aVOf thy sharp envy Can no prayers pierce thee
p50637
aVNo none that thou hast wit enough to make
p50638
aVO be thou damned inexecrable dog
p50639
aVAnd for thy life let justice be accused
p50640
aVThou almost mak\u2019st me waver in my faith
p50641
aVTo hold opinion with Pythagoras
p50642
aVThat souls of animals infuse themselves
p50643
aVInto the trunks of men Thy currish spirit
p50644
aVGoverned a wolf who hanged for human slaughter
p50645
aVEven from the gallows did his fell soul fleet
p50646
aVAnd whilst thou layest in thy unhallowed dam
p50647
aVInfused itself in thee for thy desires
p50648
aVAre wolfish bloody starved and ravenous
p50649
aVTill thou canst rail the seal from off my bond
p50650
aVThou but offend\u2019st thy lungs to speak so loud
p50651
aVRepair thy wit good youth or it will fall
p50652
aVTo cureless ruin I stand here for law
p50653
aVThis letter from Bellario doth commend
p50654
aVA young and learnèd doctor to our court
p50655
aVWhere is he
p50656
aVHe attendeth here hard by
p50657
aVTo know your answer whether you\u2019ll admit him
p50658
aVWith all my heart Some three or four of you
p50659
aVGo give him courteous conduct to this place
p50660
aVMeantime the court shall hear Bellario\u2019s letter
p50661
aVYou hear the learnèd Bellario what he writes
p50662
aVAnd here I take it is the doctor come
p50663
aVGive me your hand Come you from old Bellario
p50664
aVI did my lord
p50665
aVYou are welcome Take your place
p50666
aVAre you acquainted with the difference
p50667
aVThat holds this present question in the court
p50668
aVI am informèd throughly of the cause
p50669
aVWhich is the merchant here And which the Jew
p50670
aVAntonio and old Shylock both stand forth
p50671
aVIs your name Shylock
p50672
aVShylock is my name
p50673
aVOf a strange nature is the suit you follow
p50674
aVYet in such rule that the Venetian law
p50675
aVCannot impugn you as you do proceed
p50676
aVTo Antonio You stand within his danger do you not
p50677
aVAy so he says
p50678
aVDo you confess the bond
p50679
aVI do
p50680
aVThen must the Jew be merciful
p50681
aVOn what compulsion must I Tell me that
p50682
aVThe quality of mercy is not strained
p50683
aVIt droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven
p50684
aVUpon the place beneath It is twice blest
p50685
aVIt blesseth him that gives and him that takes
p50686
aV\u2019Tis mightiest in the mightiest it becomes
p50687
aVThe thronèd monarch better than his crown
p50688
aVHis scepter shows the force of temporal power
p50689
aVThe attribute to awe and majesty
p50690
aVWherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings
p50691
aVBut mercy is above this sceptered sway
p50692
aVIt is enthronèd in the hearts of kings
p50693
aVIt is an attribute to God Himself
p50694
aVAnd earthly power doth then show likest God\u2019s
p50695
aVWhen mercy seasons justice Therefore Jew
p50696
aVThough justice be thy plea consider this
p50697
aVThat in the course of justice none of us
p50698
aVShould see salvation We do pray for mercy
p50699
aVAnd that same prayer doth teach us all to render
p50700
aVThe deeds of mercy I have spoke thus much
p50701
aVTo mitigate the justice of thy plea
p50702
aVWhich if thou follow this strict court of Venice
p50703
aVMust needs give sentence \u2019gainst the merchant there
p50704
aVMy deeds upon my head I crave the law
p50705
aVThe penalty and forfeit of my bond
p50706
aVIs he not able to discharge the money
p50707
aVYes Here I tender it for him in the court
p50708
aVYea twice the sum If that will not suffice
p50709
aVI will be bound to pay it ten times o\u2019er
p50710
aVOn forfeit of my hands my head my heart
p50711
aVIf this will not suffice it must appear
p50712
aVThat malice bears down truth To the Duke And I beseech you
p50713
aVWrest once the law to your authority
p50714
aVTo do a great right do a little wrong
p50715
aVAnd curb this cruel devil of his will
p50716
aVIt must not be There is no power in Venice
p50717
aVCan alter a decree establishèd
p50718
aV\u2019Twill be recorded for a precedent
p50719
aVAnd many an error by the same example
p50720
aVWill rush into the state It cannot be
p50721
aVA Daniel come to judgment Yea a Daniel
p50722
aVO wise young judge how I do honor thee
p50723
aVI pray you let me look upon the bond
p50724
aVHere \u2019tis most reverend doctor here it is
p50725
aVShylock there\u2019s thrice thy money offered thee
p50726
aVAn oath an oath I have an oath in heaven
p50727
aVShall I lay perjury upon my soul
p50728
aVNo not for Venice
p50729
aVWhy this bond is forfeit
p50730
aVAnd lawfully by this the Jew may claim
p50731
aVA pound of flesh to be by him cut off
p50732
aVNearest the merchant\u2019s heart Be merciful
p50733
aVTake thrice thy money bid me tear the bond
p50734
aVWhen it is paid according to the tenor
p50735
aVIt doth appear you are a worthy judge
p50736
aVYou know the law your exposition
p50737
aVHath been most sound I charge you by the law
p50738
aVWhereof you are a well-deserving pillar
p50739
aVProceed to judgment By my soul I swear
p50740
aVThere is no power in the tongue of man
p50741
aVTo alter me I stay here on my bond
p50742
aVMost heartily I do beseech the court
p50743
aVTo give the judgment
p50744
aVWhy then thus it is
p50745
aVYou must prepare your bosom for his knife
p50746
aVO noble judge O excellent young man
p50747
aVFor the intent and purpose of the law
p50748
aVHath full relation to the penalty
p50749
aVWhich here appeareth due upon the bond
p50750
aV\u2019Tis very true O wise and upright judge
p50751
aVHow much more elder art thou than thy looks
p50752
aVTherefore lay bare your bosom
p50753
aVAy his breast
p50754
aVSo says the bond doth it not noble judge
p50755
aVNearest his heart Those are the very words
p50756
aVIt is so
p50757
aVAre there balance here to weigh the flesh
p50758
aVI have them ready
p50759
aVHave by some surgeon Shylock on your charge
p50760
aVTo stop his wounds lest he do bleed to death
p50761
aVIs it so nominated in the bond
p50762
aVIt is not so expressed but what of that
p50763
aV\u2019Twere good you do so much for charity
p50764
aVI cannot find it \u2019Tis not in the bond
p50765
aVYou merchant have you anything to say
p50766
aVBut little I am armed and well prepared
p50767
aVGive me your hand Bassanio Fare you well
p50768
aVGrieve not that I am fall\u2019n to this for you
p50769
aVFor herein Fortune shows herself more kind
p50770
aVThan is her custom it is still her use
p50771
aVTo let the wretched man outlive his wealth
p50772
aVTo view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow
p50773
aVAn age of poverty from which ling\u2019ring penance
p50774
aVOf such misery doth she cut me off

aVCommend me to your honorable wife

aVTell her the process of Antonio\u2019s end
p50777
aVSay how I loved you speak me fair in death
p50778
aVAnd when the tale is told bid her be judge
p50779
aVWhether Bassanio had not once a love
p50780
aVRepent but you that you shall lose your friend
p50781
aVAnd he repents not that he pays your debt
p50782
aVFor if the Jew do cut but deep enough
p50783
aVI\u2019ll pay it instantly with all my heart
p50784
aVAntonio I am married to a wife
p50785
aVWhich is as dear to me as life itself
p50786
aVBut life itself my wife and all the world
p50787
aVAre not with me esteemed above thy life
p50788
aVI would lose all ay sacrifice them all
p50789
aVHere to this devil to deliver you

aVThese be the Christian husbands I have a daughter
p50798

aVMost worthy gentleman I and my friend
p50915

p50916
aVOf grievous penalties in lieu whereof

aVDear sir of force I must attempt you further

p50929
aVNot as fee Grant me two things I pray you
p50930

p50941
aVThe dearest ring in Venice will I give you
p50942
aVAnd find it out by proclamation
p50943
aVOnly for this I pray you pardon me
p50944
aVI see sir you are liberal in offers

aVYou taught me first to beg and now methinks
p50946
aVYou teach me how a beggar should be answered
p50947
aVGood sir this ring was given me by my wife
p50948
aVAnd when she put it on she made me vow
p50949
aVThat I should neither sell nor give nor lose it
p50950
aVThat \u2019scuse serves many men to save their gifts
p50951
aVAnd if your wife be not a madwoman
p50952
aVAnd know how well I have deserved this ring
p50953

p50980
aVThou mayst I warrant We shall have old swearing
p50981
aVThat they did give the rings away to men
p50982
aVBut we\u2019ll outface them and outswear them too
p50983
aVAway make haste Thou know\u2019st where I will tarry
p50984
aVCome good sir will you show me to this house
p50985
aVThe moon shines bright In such a night as this
p50986
aVWhen the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees
p50987
aVAnd they did make no noise in such a night
p50988
aVTroilus methinks mounted the Trojan walls
p50989
aVAnd sighed his soul toward the Grecian tents
p50990
aVWhere Cressid lay that night
p50991
aVIn such a night
p50992
aVDid Thisbe fearfully o\u2019ertrip the dew
p50993
aVAnd saw the lion\u2019s shadow ere himself
p50994
aVAnd ran dismayed away
p50995
aVIn such a night
p50996
aVStood Dido with a willow in her hand
p50997
aVUpon the wild sea-banks and waft her love
p50998
aVTo come again to Carthage
p50999
aVIn such a night
p51000
aVMedea gathered the enchanted herbs
p51001
aVThat did renew old Aeson
p51002
aVIn such a night
p51003
aVDid Jessica steal from the wealthy Jew
p51004
aVAnd with an unthrift love did run from Venice
p51005
aVAs far as Belmont
p51006
aVIn such a night
p51007
aVDid young Lorenzo swear he loved her well
p51008
aVStealing her soul with many vows of faith
p51009
aVAnd ne\u2019er a true one
p51010
aVIn such a night
p51011
aVDid pretty Jessica like a little shrew
p51012
aVSlander her love and he forgave it her
p51013
aVI would out-night you did nobody come
p51014
aVBut hark I hear the footing of a man
p51015
aVWho comes so fast in silence of the night
p51016
aVA friend What friend Your name I pray you friend
p51017
aVStephano is my name and I bring word
p51018
aVMy mistress will before the break of day
p51019
aVBe here at Belmont She doth stray about
p51020
aVBy holy crosses where she kneels and prays
p51021
aVFor happy wedlock hours
p51022
aVWho comes with her
p51023
aVNone but a holy hermit and her maid
p51024
aVI pray you is my master yet returned
p51025
aVHe is not nor we have not heard from him
p51026
aVBut go we in I pray thee Jessica
p51027
aVAnd ceremoniously let us prepare
p51028
aVSome welcome for the mistress of the house
p51029
aVLet\u2019s in and there expect their coming
p51030
aVAnd yet no matter why should we go in
p51031
aVMy friend Stephano signify I pray you
p51032
aVWithin the house your mistress is at hand
p51033
aVAnd bring your music forth into the air
p51034
aVHow sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank
p51035
aVHere will we sit and let the sounds of music
p51036
aVCreep in our ears soft stillness and the night
p51037
aVBecome the touches of sweet harmony
p51038
aVSit Jessica Look how the floor of heaven
p51039
aVIs thick inlaid with patens of bright gold
p51040
aVThere\u2019s not the smallest orb which thou behold\u2019st
p51041
aVBut in his motion like an angel sings
p51042
aVStill choiring to the young-eyed cherubins
p51043
aVSuch harmony is in immortal souls
p51044
aVBut whilst this muddy vesture of decay
p51045
aVDoth grossly close it in we cannot hear it
p51046
aVCome ho and wake Diana with a hymn
p51047
aVWith sweetest touches pierce your mistress\u2019 ear
p51048
aVAnd draw her home with music
p51049
aVI am never merry when I hear sweet music
p51050
aVThe reason is your spirits are attentive
p51051
aVFor do but note a wild and wanton herd
p51052
aVOr race of youthful and unhandled colts
p51053
aVFetching mad bounds bellowing and neighing loud
p51054
aVWhich is the hot condition of their blood
p51055
aVIf they but hear perchance a trumpet sound
p51056
aVOr any air of music touch their ears
p51057
aVYou shall perceive them make a mutual stand
p51058
aVTheir savage eyes turned to a modest gaze
p51059
aVBy the sweet power of music Therefore the poet
p51060
aVDid feign that Orpheus drew trees stones and floods
p51061
aVSince naught so stockish hard and full of rage
p51062
aVBut music for the time doth change his nature
p51063
aVThe man that hath no music in himself
p51064
aVNor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds
p51065
aVIs fit for treasons stratagems and spoils
p51066
aVThe motions of his spirit are dull as night
p51067
aVAnd his affections dark as Erebus
p51068
aVLet no such man be trusted Mark the music
p51069
aVThat light we see is burning in my hall
p51070
aVHow far that little candle throws his beams
p51071
aVSo shines a good deed in a naughty world
p51072
aVWhen the moon shone we did not see the candle
p51073
aVSo doth the greater glory dim the less
p51074
aVA substitute shines brightly as a king
p51075
aVUntil a king be by and then his state
p51076
aVEmpties itself as doth an inland brook
p51077
aVInto the main of waters Music hark
p51078
aVIt is your music madam of the house
p51079
aVNothing is good I see without respect
p51080
aVMethinks it sounds much sweeter than by day
p51081
aVSilence bestows that virtue on it madam
p51082
aVThe crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark
p51083
aVWhen neither is attended and I think
p51084
aVThe nightingale if she should sing by day
p51085
aVWhen every goose is cackling would be thought
p51086
aVNo better a musician than the wren
p51087
aVHow many things by season seasoned are
p51088
aVTo their right praise and true perfection
p51089
aVPeace how the moon sleeps with Endymion
p51090
aVAnd would not be awaked
p51091
aVThat is the voice
p51092
aVOr I am much deceived of Portia
p51093
aVHe knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo
p51094
aVBy the bad voice
p51095
aVDear lady welcome home
p51096
aVWe have been praying for our husbands\u2019 welfare
p51097
aVWhich speed we hope the better for our words
p51098
aVAre they returned
p51099
aVMadam they are not yet
p51100
aVBut there is come a messenger before
p51101
aVTo signify their coming
p51102
aVGo in Nerissa
p51103
aVGive order to my servants that they take
p51104
aVNo note at all of our being absent hence
p51105
aVNor you Lorenzo Jessica nor you
p51106
aVYour husband is at hand I hear his trumpet
p51107
aVWe are no tell-tales madam fear you not
p51108
aVThis night methinks is but the daylight sick
p51109
aVIt looks a little paler \u2019Tis a day
p51110
aVSuch as the day is when the sun is hid
p51111
aVWe should hold day with the Antipodes
p51112
aVIf you would walk in absence of the sun
p51113
aVLet me give light but let me not be light
p51114
aVFor a light wife doth make a heavy husband
p51115
aVAnd never be Bassanio so for me
p51116
aVBut God sort all You are welcome home my lord
p51117
aVI thank you madam Give welcome to my friend
p51118
aVThis is the man this is Antonio
p51119
aVTo whom I am so infinitely bound
p51120
aVYou should in all sense be much bound to him
p51121
aVFor as I hear he was much bound for you
p51122
aVNo more than I am well acquitted of
p51123
aVSir you are very welcome to our house
p51124
aVIt must appear in other ways than words
p51125
aVTherefore I scant this breathing courtesy
p51126
aVBy yonder moon I swear you do me wrong
p51127
aVIn faith I gave it to the judge\u2019s clerk
p51128
aVWould he were gelt that had it for my part
p51129
aVSince you do take it love so much at heart
p51130
aVA quarrel ho already What\u2019s the matter
p51131
aVAbout a hoop of gold a paltry ring
p51132
aVThat she did give me whose posy was
p51133
aVFor all the world like cutler\u2019s poetry
p51134
aVUpon a knife Love me and leave me not
p51135
aVWhat talk you of the posy or the value
p51136
aVYou swore to me when I did give it you
p51137
aVThat you would wear it till your hour of death
p51138
aVAnd that it should lie with you in your grave
p51139
aVThough not for me yet for your vehement oaths
p51140
aVYou should have been respective and have kept it
p51141
aVGave it a judge\u2019s clerk No God\u2019s my judge
p51142
aVThe clerk will ne\u2019er wear hair on \u2019s face that had it
p51143
aVHe will an if he live to be a man
p51144
aVAy if a woman live to be a man
p51145
aVNow by this hand I gave it to a youth
p51146
aVA kind of boy a little scrubbèd boy
p51147
aVNo higher than thyself the judge\u2019s clerk
p51148
aVA prating boy that begged it as a fee
p51149
aVI could not for my heart deny it him
p51150
aVYou were to blame I must be plain with you
p51151
aVTo part so slightly with your wife\u2019s first gift
p51152
aVA thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger
p51153
aVAnd so riveted with faith unto your flesh
p51154
aVI gave my love a ring and made him swear
p51155
aVNever to part with it and here he stands
p51156
aVI dare be sworn for him he would not leave it
p51157
aVNor pluck it from his finger for the wealth
p51158
aVThat the world masters Now in faith Gratiano
p51159
aVYou give your wife too unkind a cause of grief
p51160
aVAn \u2019twere to me I should be mad at it
p51161
aVWhy I were best to cut my left hand off
p51162
aVAnd swear I lost the ring defending it
p51163
aVMy Lord Bassanio gave his ring away
p51164
aVUnto the judge that begged it and indeed
p51165
aVDeserved it too And then the boy his clerk
p51166
aVThat took some pains in writing he begged mine
p51167
aVAnd neither man nor master would take aught
p51168
aVBut the two rings
p51169
aVWhat ring gave you my lord
p51170
aVNot that I hope which you received of me
p51171
aVIf I could add a lie unto a fault
p51172
aVI would deny it but you see my finger
p51173
aVHath not the ring upon it It is gone
p51174
aVEven so void is your false heart of truth
p51175
aVBy heaven I will ne\u2019er come in your bed
p51176
aVUntil I see the ring
p51177
aVNor I in yours
p51178
aVTill I again see mine
p51179
aVSweet Portia
p51180
aVIf you did know to whom I gave the ring
p51181
aVIf you did know for whom I gave the ring
p51182
aVAnd would conceive for what I gave the ring
p51183
aVAnd how unwillingly I left the ring
p51184
aVWhen naught would be accepted but the ring
p51185
aVYou would abate the strength of your displeasure
p51186
aVIf you had known the virtue of the ring
p51187
aVOr half her worthiness that gave the ring
p51188
aVOr your own honor to contain the ring
p51189
aVYou would not then have parted with the ring
p51190
aVWhat man is there so much unreasonable
p51191
aVIf you had pleased to have defended it
p51192
aVWith any terms of zeal wanted the modesty
p51193
aVTo urge the thing held as a ceremony
p51194
aVNerissa teaches me what to believe
p51195
aVI\u2019ll die for \u2019t but some woman had the ring
p51196
aVNo by my honor madam by my soul
p51197
aVNo woman had it but a civil doctor
p51198
aVWhich did refuse three thousand ducats of me
p51199
aVAnd begged the ring the which I did deny him
p51200
aVAnd suffered him to go displeased away
p51201
aVEven he that had held up the very life
p51202
aVOf my dear friend What should I say sweet lady
p51203
aVI was enforced to send it after him
p51204
aVI was beset with shame and courtesy
p51205
aVMy honor would not let ingratitude
p51206
aVSo much besmear it Pardon me good lady
p51207
aVFor by these blessèd candles of the night
p51208
aVHad you been there I think you would have begged
p51209
aVThe ring of me to give the worthy doctor
p51210
aVLet not that doctor e\u2019er come near my house
p51211
aVSince he hath got the jewel that I loved
p51212
aVAnd that which you did swear to keep for me
p51213
aVI will become as liberal as you
p51214
aVI\u2019ll not deny him anything I have
p51215
aVNo not my body nor my husband\u2019s bed
p51216
aVKnow him I shall I am well sure of it
p51217
aVLie not a night from home Watch me like Argus
p51218
aVIf you do not if I be left alone
p51219
aVNow by mine honor which is yet mine own
p51220
aVI\u2019ll have that doctor for my bedfellow
p51221
aVAnd I his clerk Therefore be well advised
p51222
aVHow you do leave me to mine own protection
p51223
aVWell do you so Let not me take him then
p51224
aVFor if I do I\u2019ll mar the young clerk\u2019s pen
p51225
aVI am th\u2019 unhappy subject of these quarrels
p51226
aVSir grieve not you You are welcome notwithstanding
p51227
aVPortia forgive me this enforcèd wrong
p51228
aVAnd in the hearing of these many friends
p51229
aVI swear to thee even by thine own fair eyes
p51230
aVWherein I see myself
p51231
aVMark you but that
p51232
aVIn both my eyes he doubly sees himself
p51233
aVIn each eye one Swear by your double self
p51234
aVAnd there\u2019s an oath of credit
p51235
aVNay but hear me
p51236
aVPardon this fault and by my soul I swear
p51237
aVI never more will break an oath with thee
p51238
aVI once did lend my body for his wealth
p51239
aVWhich but for him that had your husband\u2019s ring
p51240
aVHad quite miscarried I dare be bound again
p51241
aVMy soul upon the forfeit that your lord
p51242
aVWill never more break faith advisedly
p51243
aVThen you shall be his surety Give him this
p51244
aVAnd bid him keep it better than the other
p51245
aVHere Lord Bassanio swear to keep this ring
p51246
aVBy heaven it is the same I gave the doctor
p51247
aVI had it of him Pardon me Bassanio
p51248
aVFor by this ring the doctor lay with me
p51249
aVAnd pardon me my gentle Gratiano
p51250
aVFor that same scrubbèd boy the doctor\u2019s clerk
p51251
aVIn lieu of this last night did lie with me
p51252
aVWhy this is like the mending of highways
p51253
aVIn summer where the ways are fair enough
p51254
aVWhat are we cuckolds ere we have deserved it
p51255
aVSpeak not so grossly You are all amazed
p51256
aVHere is a letter read it at your leisure
p51257
aVIt comes from Padua from Bellario
p51258
aVThere you shall find that Portia was the doctor
p51259
aVNerissa there her clerk Lorenzo here
p51260
aVShall witness I set forth as soon as you
p51261
aVAnd even but now returned I have not yet
p51262
aVEntered my house Antonio you are welcome
p51263
aVAnd I have better news in store for you
p51264
aVThan you expect Unseal this letter soon
p51265
aVThere you shall find three of your argosies
p51266
aVAre richly come to harbor suddenly
p51267
aVYou shall not know by what strange accident
p51268
aVI chancèd on this letter
p51269
aVI am dumb
p51270
aVWere you the doctor and I knew you not
p51271
aVWere you the clerk that is to make me cuckold
p51272
aVAy but the clerk that never means to do it
p51273

p51274
aVSweet doctor you shall be my bedfellow
p51275
aVWhen I am absent then lie with my wife
p51276
aVSweet lady you have given me life and living
p51277
aVFor here I read for certain that my ships

aVMy clerk hath some good comforts too for you
p51281
aVAy and I\u2019ll give them him without a fee
p51282
aVThere do I give to you and Jessica

aVFrom the rich Jew a special deed of gift
p51284
aVAfter his death of all he dies possessed of
p51285
aVFair ladies you drop manna in the way
p51286
aVOf starvèd people
p51287
aVIt is almost morning
p51288
aVAnd yet I am sure you are not satisfied
p51289
aVOf these events at full Let us go in
p51290
aVAnd charge us there upon inter\u2019gatories
p51291
aVAnd we will answer all things faithfully
p51292
aVLet it be so The first inter\u2019gatory
p51293
aVThat my Nerissa shall be sworn on is
p51294
aVWhether till the next night she had rather stay
p51295
aVOr go to bed now being two hours to day
p51296
aVBut were the day come I should wish it dark
p51297
aVTill I were couching with the doctor\u2019s clerk
p51298
aVWell while I live I\u2019ll fear no other thing
p51299
aVSo sore as keeping safe Nerissa\u2019s ring
p51300
aVTush never tell me I take it much unkindly
p51301
aVThat thou Iago who hast had my purse
p51302
aVAs if the strings were thine shouldst know of this
p51303
aV\u2019Sblood but you\u2019ll not hear me
p51304
aVIf ever I did dream of such a matter
p51305
aVAbhor me
p51306
aVThou toldst me thou didst hold him in thy hate
p51307
aVDespise me
p51308
aVIf I do not Three great ones of the city
p51309
aVIn personal suit to make me his lieutenant
p51310
aVOff-capped to him and by the faith of man
p51311
aVI know my price I am worth no worse a place
p51312
aVBut he as loving his own pride and purposes
p51313
aVEvades them with a bombast circumstance
p51314
aVHorribly stuffed with epithets of war
p51315
aVAnd in conclusion
p51316
aVNonsuits my mediators For Certes says he
p51317
aVI have already chose my officer
p51318
aVAnd what was he
p51319
aVForsooth a great arithmetician
p51320
aVOne Michael Cassio a Florentine
p51321
aVA fellow almost damned in a fair wife
p51322
aVThat never set a squadron in the field
p51323
aVNor the division of a battle knows
p51324
aVMore than a spinster unless the bookish theoric
p51325
aVWherein the togèd consuls can propose
p51326
aVAs masterly as he Mere prattle without practice
p51327
aVIs all his soldiership But he sir had th\u2019 election
p51328
aVAnd I of whom his eyes had seen the proof
p51329
aVAt Rhodes at Cyprus and on other grounds
p51330
aVChristened and heathen must be beleed and calmed
p51331
aVBy debitor and creditor This countercaster
p51332
aVHe in good time must his lieutenant be
p51333
aVAnd I God bless the mark his Moorship\u2019s ancient
p51334
aVBy heaven I rather would have been his hangman
p51335
aVWhy there\u2019s no remedy \u2019Tis the curse of service
p51336
aVPreferment goes by letter and affection
p51337
aVAnd not by old gradation where each second
p51338
aVStood heir to th\u2019 first Now sir be judge yourself
p51339
aVWhether I in any just term am affined
p51340
aVTo love the Moor
p51341
aVI would not follow him then
p51342
aVO sir content you
p51343
aVI follow him to serve my turn upon him
p51344
aVWe cannot all be masters nor all masters
p51345
aVCannot be truly followed You shall mark
p51346
aVMany a duteous and knee-crooking knave
p51347
aVThat doting on his own obsequious bondage
p51348
aVWears out his time much like his master\u2019s ass
p51349
aVFor naught but provender and when he\u2019s old cashiered
p51350
aVWhip me such honest knaves Others there are
p51351
aVWho trimmed in forms and visages of duty
p51352
aVKeep yet their hearts attending on themselves
p51353
aVAnd throwing but shows of service on their lords
p51354
aVDo well thrive by them and when they have lined their coats
p51355
aVDo themselves homage These fellows have some soul
p51356
aVAnd such a one do I profess myself For sir
p51357
aVIt is as sure as you are Roderigo
p51358
aVWere I the Moor I would not be Iago
p51359
aVIn following him I follow but myself
p51360
aVHeaven is my judge not I for love and duty
p51361
aVBut seeming so for my peculiar end
p51362
aVFor when my outward action doth demonstrate
p51363
aVThe native act and figure of my heart
p51364
aVIn complement extern \u2019tis not long after
p51365
aVBut I will wear my heart upon my sleeve
p51366
aVFor daws to peck at I am not what I am
p51367
aVWhat a full fortune does the thick-lips owe
p51368
aVIf he can carry \u2019t thus
p51369
aVCall up her father
p51370
aVRouse him Make after him poison his delight
p51371
aVProclaim him in the streets incense her kinsmen
p51372
aVAnd though he in a fertile climate dwell
p51373
aVPlague him with flies Though that his joy be joy
p51374
aVYet throw such chances of vexation on \u2019t
p51375
aVAs it may lose some color
p51376
aVHere is her father\u2019s house I\u2019ll call aloud
p51377
aVDo with like timorous accent and dire yell
p51378
aVAs when by night and negligence the fire
p51379
aVIs spied in populous cities
p51380
aVWhat ho Brabantio Signior Brabantio ho

p51397
aVMost reverend signior do you know my voice
p51398
aVNot I What are you
p51399
aVMy name is Roderigo
p51400
aVThe worser welcome
p51401
aVI have charged thee not to haunt about my doors
p51402
aVIn honest plainness thou hast heard me say
p51403
aVMy daughter is not for thee And now in madness
p51404
aVBeing full of supper and distemp\u2019ring draughts
p51405
aVUpon malicious bravery dost thou come
p51406
aVTo start my quiet
p51407
aVSir sir sir
p51408
aVBut thou must needs be sure
p51409
aVMy spirit and my place have in them power
p51410
aVTo make this bitter to thee
p51411
aVPatience good sir
p51412
aVWhat tell\u2019st thou me of robbing

p51414
aVMost grave Brabantio
p51415
aVIn simple and pure soul I come to you
p51416
aVWhat profane wretch art thou
p51417
aVThou art a villain
p51418
aVYou are a senator
p51419
aVThis thou shalt answer I know thee Roderigo
p51420
aVSir I will answer anything But I beseech you
p51421
aVIf \u2019t be your pleasure and most wise consent
p51422
aVAs partly I find it is that your fair daughter
p51423
aVAt this odd-even and dull watch o\u2019 th\u2019 night
p51424
aVTransported with no worse nor better guard
p51425
aVBut with a knave of common hire a gondolier
p51426
aVTo the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor
p51427
aVIf this be known to you and your allowance
p51428
aVWe then have done you bold and saucy wrongs
p51429
aVBut if you know not this my manners tell me
p51430
aVWe have your wrong rebuke Do not believe
p51431
aVThat from the sense of all civility
p51432
aVI thus would play and trifle with your Reverence
p51433
aVYour daughter if you have not given her leave
p51434
aVI say again hath made a gross revolt
p51435
aVTying her duty beauty wit and fortunes
p51436
aVIn an extravagant and wheeling stranger
p51437
aVOf here and everywhere Straight satisfy yourself
p51438
aVIf she be in her chamber or your house
p51439
aVLet loose on me the justice of the state
p51440
aVFor thus deluding you
p51441
aVStrike on the tinder ho
p51442
aVGive me a taper Call up all my people
p51443
aVThis accident is not unlike my dream
p51444
aVBelief of it oppresses me already
p51445
aVLight I say light
p51446
aVFarewell for I must leave you
p51447
aVIt seems not meet nor wholesome to my place
p51448
aVTo be producted as if I stay I shall
p51449
aVAgainst the Moor For I do know the state
p51450
aVHowever this may gall him with some check
p51451
aVCannot with safety cast him for he\u2019s embarked
p51452
aVWith such loud reason to the Cyprus wars
p51453
aVWhich even now stands in act that for their souls
p51454
aVAnother of his fathom they have none
p51455
aVTo lead their business In which regard
p51456
aVThough I do hate him as I do hell pains
p51457
aVYet for necessity of present life
p51458
aVI must show out a flag and sign of love
p51459
aVWhich is indeed but sign That you shall surely find him
p51460
aVLead to the Sagittary the raisèd search
p51461
aVAnd there will I be with him So farewell
p51462
aVIt is too true an evil Gone she is
p51463
aVAnd what\u2019s to come of my despisèd time
p51464
aVIs naught but bitterness Now Roderigo
p51465
aVWhere didst thou see her O unhappy girl
p51466
aVWith the Moor sayst thou Who would be a father
p51467
aVHow didst thou know \u2019twas she O she deceives me
p51468
aVPast thought What said she to you Get more tapers
p51469
aVRaise all my kindred Are they married think you
p51470
aVTruly I think they are
p51471
aVO heaven How got she out O treason of the blood
p51472
aVFathers from hence trust not your daughters\u2019 minds
p51473
aVBy what you see them act Is there not charms
p51474
aVBy which the property of youth and maidhood
p51475
aVMay be abused Have you not read Roderigo
p51476
aVOf some such thing
p51477
aVYes sir I have indeed
p51478
aVCall up my brother O would you had had her
p51479
aVSome one way some another Do you know
p51480
aVWhere we may apprehend her and the Moor
p51481
aVI think I can discover him if you please
p51482
aVTo get good guard and go along with me
p51483
aVPray you lead on At every house I\u2019ll call
p51484
aVI may command at most Get weapons ho
p51485
aVAnd raise some special officers of night
p51486
aVOn good Roderigo I will deserve your pains
p51487
aVThough in the trade of war I have slain men
p51488
aVYet do I hold it very stuff o\u2019 th\u2019 conscience
p51489
aVTo do no contrived murder I lack iniquity
p51490
aVSometimes to do me service Nine or ten times
p51491
aVI had thought t\u2019 have yerked him here under the ribs
p51492
aV\u2019Tis better as it is
p51493
aVNay but he prated
p51494
aVAnd spoke such scurvy and provoking terms
p51495
aVAgainst your Honor
p51496
aVThat with the little godliness I have
p51497
aVI did full hard forbear him But I pray you sir
p51498
aVAre you fast married Be assured of this
p51499
aVThat the magnifico is much beloved
p51500
aVAnd hath in his effect a voice potential
p51501
aVAs double as the Duke\u2019s He will divorce you
p51502
aVOr put upon you what restraint or grievance
p51503
aVThe law with all his might to enforce it on
p51504
aVWill give him cable
p51505
aVLet him do his spite
p51506
aVMy services which I have done the signiory
p51507
aVShall out-tongue his complaints \u2019Tis yet to know
p51508
aVWhich when I know that boasting is an honor
p51509
aVI shall promulgate I fetch my life and being
p51510
aVFrom men of royal siege and my demerits
p51511
aVMay speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune
p51512
aVAs this that I have reached For know Iago
p51513
aVBut that I love the gentle Desdemona
p51514
aVI would not my unhousèd free condition
p51515
aVPut into circumscription and confine
p51516
aVFor the sea\u2019s worth But look what lights come yond
p51517
aVThose are the raisèd father and his friends
p51518
aVYou were best go in
p51519
aVNot I I must be found
p51520
aVMy parts my title and my perfect soul
p51521
aVShall manifest me rightly Is it they
p51522
aVBy Janus I think no
p51523
aVThe servants of the Duke and my lieutenant
p51524
aVThe goodness of the night upon you friends
p51525
aVWhat is the news
p51526
aVThe Duke does greet you general
p51527
aVAnd he requires your haste-post-haste appearance
p51528
aVEven on the instant
p51529
aVWhat is the matter think you
p51530
aVSomething from Cyprus as I may divine
p51531
aVIt is a business of some heat The galleys
p51532
aVHave sent a dozen sequent messengers
p51533
aVThis very night at one another\u2019s heels
p51534
aVAnd many of the Consuls raised and met
p51535
aVAre at the Duke\u2019s already You have been hotly called for
p51536
aVWhen being not at your lodging to be found
p51537
aVThe Senate hath sent about three several quests
p51538
aVTo search you out
p51539
aV\u2019Tis well I am found by you
p51540
aVI will but spend a word here in the house
p51541
aVAnd go with you
p51542
aVAncient what makes he here
p51543
aVFaith he tonight hath boarded a land carrack
p51544
aVIf it prove lawful prize he\u2019s made forever
p51545
aVI do not understand
p51546
aVHe\u2019s married
p51547
aVTo who
p51548
aVMarry to
p51549
aVCome captain will you go
p51550
aVHave with you
p51551
aVHere comes another troop to seek for you
p51552
aVIt is Brabantio General be advised
p51553
aVHe comes to bad intent
p51554
aVHolla stand there
p51555
aVSignior it is the Moor
p51556
aVDown with him thief
p51557
aVYou Roderigo Come sir I am for you
p51558
aVKeep up your bright swords for the dew will rust them
p51559
aVGood signior you shall more command with years
p51560
aVThan with your weapons
p51561
aVO thou foul thief where hast thou stowed my daughter
p51562
aVDamned as thou art thou hast enchanted her
p51563
aVFor I\u2019ll refer me to all things of sense
p51564
aVIf she in chains of magic were not bound
p51565
aVWhether a maid so tender fair and happy
p51566
aVSo opposite to marriage that she shunned
p51567
aVThe wealthy curlèd darlings of our nation
p51568
aVWould ever have t\u2019 incur a general mock
p51569
aVRun from her guardage to the sooty bosom
p51570
aVOf such a thing as thou to fear not to delight
p51571
aVJudge me the world if \u2019tis not gross in sense
p51572
aVThat thou hast practiced on her with foul charms
p51573
aVAbused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals
p51574
aVThat weakens motion I\u2019ll have \u2019t disputed on
p51575
aV\u2019Tis probable and palpable to thinking
p51576
aVI therefore apprehend and do attach thee
p51577
aVFor an abuser of the world a practicer
p51578
aVOf arts inhibited and out of warrant
p51579
aVLay hold upon him If he do resist
p51580
aVSubdue him at his peril
p51581
aVHold your hands
p51582
aVBoth you of my inclining and the rest
p51583
aVWere it my cue to fight I should have known it
p51584
aVWithout a prompter Whither will you that I go
p51585
aVTo answer this your charge
p51586
aVTo prison till fit time
p51587
aVOf law and course of direct session
p51588
aVCall thee to answer
p51589
aVWhat if I do obey
p51590
aVHow may the Duke be therewith satisfied
p51591
aVWhose messengers are here about my side
p51592
aVUpon some present business of the state
p51593
aVTo bring me to him
p51594
aV\u2019Tis true most worthy signior
p51595
aVThe Duke\u2019s in council and your noble self
p51596
aVI am sure is sent for
p51597
aVHow The Duke in council
p51598
aVIn this time of the night Bring him away
p51599
aVMine\u2019s not an idle cause The Duke himself
p51600
aVOr any of my brothers of the state
p51601
aVCannot but feel this wrong as \u2019twere their own
p51602
aVFor if such actions may have passage free
p51603
aVBondslaves and pagans shall our statesmen be
p51604
aVThere\u2019s no composition in these news
p51605
aVThat gives them credit
p51606
aVIndeed they are disproportioned
p51607
aVMy letters say a hundred and seven galleys
p51608
aVAnd mine a hundred forty
p51609
aVAnd mine two hundred
p51610
aVBut though they jump not on a just account
p51611
aVAs in these cases where the aim reports
p51612
aV\u2019Tis oft with difference yet do they all confirm
p51613
aVA Turkish fleet and bearing up to Cyprus
p51614
aVNay it is possible enough to judgment
p51615
aVI do not so secure me in the error
p51616
aVBut the main article I do approve
p51617
aVIn fearful sense
p51618
aVWhat ho what ho what ho
p51619
aVA messenger from the galleys
p51620
aVNow what\u2019s the business
p51621
aVThe Turkish preparation makes for Rhodes
p51622
aVSo was I bid report here to the state
p51623
aVBy Signior Angelo
p51624
aVHow say you by this change
p51625
aVThis cannot be
p51626
aVBy no assay of reason \u2019Tis a pageant
p51627
aVTo keep us in false gaze When we consider
p51628
aVTh\u2019 importancy of Cyprus to the Turk
p51629
aVAnd let ourselves again but understand
p51630
aVThat as it more concerns the Turk than Rhodes
p51631
aVSo may he with more facile question bear it
p51632
aVFor that it stands not in such warlike brace
p51633
aVBut altogether lacks th\u2019 abilities
p51634
aVThat Rhodes is dressed in if we make thought of this
p51635
aVWe must not think the Turk is so unskillful
p51636
aVTo leave that latest which concerns him first
p51637
aVNeglecting an attempt of ease and gain
p51638
aVTo wake and wage a danger profitless
p51639
aVNay in all confidence he\u2019s not for Rhodes
p51640
aVHere is more news
p51641
aVThe Ottomites Reverend and Gracious
p51642
aVSteering with due course toward the isle of Rhodes
p51643
aVHave there injointed them with an after fleet
p51644
aVAy so I thought How many as you guess
p51645
aVOf thirty sail and now they do restem
p51646
aVTheir backward course bearing with frank appearance
p51647
aVTheir purposes toward Cyprus Signior Montano
p51648
aVYour trusty and most valiant servitor
p51649
aVWith his free duty recommends you thus
p51650
aVAnd prays you to believe him
p51651
aV\u2019Tis certain then for Cyprus
p51652
aVMarcus Luccicos is not he in town
p51653
aVHe\u2019s now in Florence
p51654
aVWrite from us to him
p51655
aVPost-post-haste Dispatch
p51656
aVHere comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor
p51657
aVValiant Othello we must straight employ you
p51658
aVAgainst the general enemy Ottoman
p51659
aVTo Brabantio I did not see you Welcome gentle signior
p51660
aVWe lacked your counsel and your help tonight
p51661
aVSo did I yours Good your Grace pardon me
p51662
aVNeither my place nor aught I heard of business
p51663
aVHath raised me from my bed nor doth the general care
p51664
aVTake hold on me for my particular grief
p51665
aVIs of so floodgate and o\u2019erbearing nature
p51666
aVThat it engluts and swallows other sorrows
p51667
aVAnd it is still itself
p51668
aVWhy what\u2019s the matter
p51669
aVMy daughter O my daughter
p51670
aVDead
p51671
aVAy to me
p51672
aVShe is abused stol\u2019n from me and corrupted
p51673
aVBy spells and medicines bought of mountebanks
p51674
aVFor nature so prepost\u2019rously to err
p51675
aVBeing not deficient blind or lame of sense
p51676
aVSans witchcraft could not
p51677
aVWhoe\u2019er he be that in this foul proceeding
p51678
aVHath thus beguiled your daughter of herself
p51679
aVAnd you of her the bloody book of law
p51680
aVYou shall yourself read in the bitter letter
p51681
aVAfter your own sense yea though our proper son
p51682
aVStood in your action
p51683
aVHumbly I thank your Grace
p51684
aVHere is the man this Moor whom now it seems
p51685
aVYour special mandate for the state affairs
p51686
aVHath hither brought
p51687
aVWe are very sorry for \u2019t
p51688
aVWhat in your own part can you say to this
p51689
aVNothing but this is so
p51690
aVMost potent grave and reverend signiors
p51691
aVMy very noble and approved good masters
p51692
aVThat I have ta\u2019en away this old man\u2019s daughter
p51693
aVIt is most true true I have married her
p51694
aVThe very head and front of my offending
p51695
aVHath this extent no more Rude am I in my speech
p51696
aVAnd little blessed with the soft phrase of peace
p51697
aVFor since these arms of mine had seven years\u2019 pith
p51698
aVTill now some nine moons wasted they have used
p51699
aVTheir dearest action in the tented field
p51700
aVAnd little of this great world can I speak
p51701
aVMore than pertains to feats of broil and battle
p51702
aVAnd therefore little shall I grace my cause
p51703
aVIn speaking for myself Yet by your gracious patience
p51704
aVI will a round unvarnished tale deliver
p51705
aVOf my whole course of love what drugs what charms
p51706
aVWhat conjuration and what mighty magic
p51707
aVFor such proceeding I am charged withal
p51708
aVI won his daughter
p51709
aVA maiden never bold
p51710
aVOf spirit so still and quiet that her motion
p51711
aVBlushed at herself And she in spite of nature
p51712
aVOf years of country credit everything
p51713
aVTo fall in love with what she feared to look on
p51714
aVIt is a judgment maimed and most imperfect
p51715
aVThat will confess perfection so could err
p51716
aVAgainst all rules of nature and must be driven
p51717
aVTo find out practices of cunning hell
p51718
aVWhy this should be I therefore vouch again
p51719
aVThat with some mixtures powerful o\u2019er the blood
p51720
aVOr with some dram conjured to this effect
p51721
aVHe wrought upon her
p51722
aVTo vouch this is no proof
p51723
aVWithout more wider and more overt test
p51724
aVThan these thin habits and poor likelihoods
p51725
aVOf modern seeming do prefer against him
p51726
aVBut Othello speak
p51727
aVDid you by indirect and forcèd courses
p51728
aVSubdue and poison this young maid\u2019s affections
p51729
aVOr came it by request and such fair question
p51730
aVAs soul to soul affordeth
p51731
aVI do beseech you
p51732
aVSend for the lady to the Sagittary
p51733
aVAnd let her speak of me before her father
p51734
aVIf you do find me foul in her report
p51735
aVThe trust the office I do hold of you
p51736
aVNot only take away but let your sentence
p51737
aVEven fall upon my life
p51738
aVFetch Desdemona hither
p51739
aVAncient conduct them You best know the place
p51740
aVAnd till she come as truly as to heaven
p51741
aVI do confess the vices of my blood
p51742
aVSo justly to your grave ears I\u2019ll present
p51743
aVHow I did thrive in this fair lady\u2019s love
p51744
aVAnd she in mine
p51745
aVSay it Othello
p51746
aVHer father loved me oft invited me
p51747
aVStill questioned me the story of my life
p51748
aVFrom year to year the battles sieges fortunes
p51749
aVThat I have passed
p51750
aVI ran it through even from my boyish days
p51751
aVTo th\u2019 very moment that he bade me tell it
p51752
aVWherein I spoke of most disastrous chances
p51753
aVOf moving accidents by flood and field
p51754
aVOf hairbreadth \u2019scapes i\u2019 th\u2019 imminent deadly breach
p51755
aVOf being taken by the insolent foe
p51756
aVAnd sold to slavery of my redemption thence
p51757
aVAnd portance in my traveler\u2019s history
p51758
aVWherein of antres vast and deserts idle
p51759
aVRough quarries rocks and hills whose heads touch heaven
p51760
aVIt was my hint to speak such was my process
p51761
aVAnd of the cannibals that each other eat
p51762
aVThe Anthropophagi and men whose heads
p51763
aVDo grow beneath their shoulders These things to hear
p51764
aVWould Desdemona seriously incline
p51765
aVBut still the house affairs would draw her thence
p51766
aVWhich ever as she could with haste dispatch
p51767
aVShe\u2019d come again and with a greedy ear
p51768
aVDevour up my discourse Which I observing
p51769
aVTook once a pliant hour and found good means
p51770
aVTo draw from her a prayer of earnest heart
p51771
aVThat I would all my pilgrimage dilate
p51772
aVWhereof by parcels she had something heard
p51773
aVBut not intentively I did consent
p51774
aVAnd often did beguile her of her tears
p51775
aVWhen I did speak of some distressful stroke
p51776
aVThat my youth suffered My story being done
p51777
aVShe gave me for my pains a world of sighs
p51778
aVShe swore in faith \u2019twas strange \u2019twas passing strange
p51779
aV\u2019Twas pitiful \u2019twas wondrous pitiful
p51780
aVShe wished she had not heard it yet she wished
p51781
aVThat heaven had made her such a man She thanked me
p51782
aVAnd bade me if I had a friend that loved her
p51783
aVI should but teach him how to tell my story
p51784
aVAnd that would woo her Upon this hint I spake
p51785
aVShe loved me for the dangers I had passed
p51786
aVAnd I loved her that she did pity them
p51787
aVThis only is the witchcraft I have used
p51788
aVHere comes the lady Let her witness it
p51789
aVI think this tale would win my daughter too
p51790
aVGood Brabantio
p51791
aVTake up this mangled matter at the best
p51792
aVMen do their broken weapons rather use
p51793
aVThan their bare hands
p51794
aVI pray you hear her speak
p51795
aVIf she confess that she was half the wooer
p51796
aVDestruction on my head if my bad blame
p51797
aVLight on the man Come hither gentle mistress
p51798
aVDo you perceive in all this noble company
p51799
aVWhere most you owe obedience
p51800
aVMy noble father
p51801
aVI do perceive here a divided duty
p51802
aVTo you I am bound for life and education
p51803
aVMy life and education both do learn me
p51804
aVHow to respect you You are the lord of duty
p51805
aVI am hitherto your daughter But here\u2019s my husband
p51806
aVAnd so much duty as my mother showed
p51807
aVTo you preferring you before her father
p51808
aVSo much I challenge that I may profess
p51809
aVDue to the Moor my lord
p51810
aVGod be with you I have done
p51811
aVPlease it your Grace on to the state affairs
p51812
aVI had rather to adopt a child than get it
p51813
aVCome hither Moor

aVI here do give thee that with all my heart
p51815
aVWhich but thou hast already with all my heart
p51816
aVI would keep from thee For your sake jewel
p51817
aVI am glad at soul I have no other child
p51818
aVFor thy escape would teach me tyranny
p51819
aVTo hang clogs on them I have done my lord
p51820
aVLet me speak like yourself and lay a sentence
p51821
aVWhich as a grise or step may help these lovers
p51822
aVInto your favor
p51823
aVWhen remedies are past the griefs are ended
p51824
aVBy seeing the worst which late on hopes depended
p51825
aVTo mourn a mischief that is past and gone
p51826
aVIs the next way to draw new mischief on
p51827
aVWhat cannot be preserved when fortune takes
p51828
aVPatience her injury a mock\u2019ry makes
p51829
aVThe robbed that smiles steals something from the thief
p51830
aVHe robs himself that spends a bootless grief
p51831
aVSo let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile
p51832
aVWe lose it not so long as we can smile
p51833
aVHe bears the sentence well that nothing bears
p51834
aVBut the free comfort which from thence he hears
p51835
aVBut he bears both the sentence and the sorrow
p51836
aVThat to pay grief must of poor patience borrow
p51837
aVThese sentences to sugar or to gall
p51838
aVBeing strong on both sides are equivocal
p51839
aVBut words are words I never yet did hear
p51840
aVThat the bruised heart was piercèd through the ear
p51841
aVI humbly beseech you proceed to th\u2019 affairs of state
p51842
aVThe tyrant custom most grave senators

aVSo that dear lords if I be left behind

aVThat he is too familiar with his wife
p51934
aVHe hath a person and a smooth dispose
p51935
aVTo be suspected framed to make women false
p51936
aVThe Moor is of a free and open nature
p51937
aVThat thinks men honest that but seem to be so
p51938
aVAnd will as tenderly be led by th\u2019 nose
p51939

aVFor do but stand upon the foaming shore
p51953
aVThe chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds
p51954
aVThe wind-shaked surge with high and monstrous mane
p51955
aVSeems to cast water on the burning Bear

aVShe\u2019ll find a white that shall her blackness hit
p52079
aVWorse and worse
p52080
aVHow if fair and foolish
p52081
aVShe never yet was foolish that was fair
p52082
aVFor even her folly helped her to an heir
p52083
aVThere\u2019s none so foul and foolish thereunto
p52084
aVBut does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do
p52085
aVShe that was ever fair and never proud

p52100
aVTo see you here before me O my soul\u2019s joy

aVOnce more well met at Cyprus
p52133
aVThat Cassio loves her I do well believe \u2019t
p52134
aVThat she loves him \u2019tis apt and of great credit
p52135
aVThe Moor howbeit that I endure him not
p52136
aVIs of a constant loving noble nature
p52137
aVAnd I dare think he\u2019ll prove to Desdemona

aVA most dear husband Now I do love her too
p52139
aVNot out of absolute lust though peradventure
p52140
aVI stand accountant for as great a sin

aVFor that I do suspect the lusty Moor

aVDoth like a poisonous mineral gnaw my inwards
p52145
aVAnd nothing can or shall content my soul
p52146
aVTill I am evened with him wife for wife
p52147
aVOr failing so yet that I put the Moor
p52148
aVAt least into a jealousy so strong
p52149
aVThat judgment cannot cure Which thing to do
p52150
aVIf this poor trash of Venice whom I trace
p52151
aVFor his quick hunting stand the putting on
p52152
aVI\u2019ll have our Michael Cassio on the hip
p52153
aVAbuse him to the Moor in the rank garb
p52154
aVFor I fear Cassio with my nightcap too
p52155
aVMake the Moor thank me love me and reward me
p52156
aVFor making him egregiously an ass
p52157
aVAnd practicing upon his peace and quiet
p52158
aVEven to madness \u2019Tis here but yet confused
p52159
aVKnavery\u2019s plain face is never seen till used
p52160
aVGood Michael look you to the guard tonight

aVLet\u2019s teach ourselves that honorable stop

aVNot to outsport discretion

aVBut notwithstanding with my personal eye
p52165
aVWill I look to \u2019t
p52166
aVIago is most honest
p52167
aVMichael goodnight Tomorrow with your earliest
p52168
aVLet me have speech with you To Desdemona Come my dear love

aVWelcome Iago We must to the watch
p52173
aVIf I can fasten but one cup upon him
p52174
aVWith that which he hath drunk tonight already
p52175
aVHe\u2019ll be as full of quarrel and offense
p52176
aVAs my young mistress\u2019 dog Now my sick fool Roderigo
p52177
aVWhom love hath turned almost the wrong side out
p52178
aVTo Desdemona hath tonight caroused
p52179
aVPotations pottle-deep and he\u2019s to watch
p52180
aVThree else of Cyprus noble swelling spirits
p52181
aVThat hold their honors in a wary distance
p52182
aVThe very elements of this warlike isle
p52183
aVHave I tonight flustered with flowing cups
p52184
aVAnd they watch too Now \u2019mongst this flock of drunkards
p52185
aVAm I to put our Cassio in some action
p52186
aVThat may offend the isle But here they come
p52187
aVIf consequence do but approve my dream
p52188
aVMy boat sails freely both with wind and stream
p52189
aVAnd let me the cannikin clink clink
p52190
aVAnd let me the cannikin clink
p52191
aVA soldier\u2019s a man
p52192
aVO man\u2019s life\u2019s but a span
p52193
aVWhy then let a soldier drink
p52194
aVKing Stephen was and-a worthy peer
p52195
aVHis breeches cost him but a crown
p52196
aVHe held them sixpence all too dear
p52197
aVWith that he called the tailor lown
p52198
aVHe was a wight of high renown
p52199
aVAnd thou art but of low degree
p52200
aV\u2019Tis pride that pulls the country down
p52201
aVThen take thy auld cloak about thee
p52202
aVTo th\u2019 platform masters Come let\u2019s set the watch
p52203
aVYou see this fellow that is gone before
p52204
aVHe\u2019s a soldier fit to stand by Caesar
p52205
aVAnd give direction and do but see his vice
p52206
aV\u2019Tis to his virtue a just equinox
p52207
aVThe one as long as th\u2019 other \u2019Tis pity of him
p52208
aVI fear the trust Othello puts him in
p52209
aVOn some odd time of his infirmity
p52210
aVWill shake this island
p52211
aVBut is he often thus
p52212
aV\u2019Tis evermore the prologue to his sleep
p52213
aVHe\u2019ll watch the horologe a double set
p52214
aVIf drink rock not his cradle
p52215
aVIt were well
p52216
aVThe General were put in mind of it
p52217
aVPerhaps he sees it not or his good nature
p52218
aVPrizes the virtue that appears in Cassio
p52219
aVAnd looks not on his evils Is not this true
p52220
aVHow now Roderigo
p52221
aVI pray you after the Lieutenant go
p52222
aVAnd \u2019tis great pity that the noble Moor
p52223
aVShould hazard such a place as his own second
p52224
aVWith one of an engraffed infirmity
p52225
aVIt were an honest action to say so
p52226
aVTo the Moor
p52227
aVNot I for this fair island
p52228
aVI do love Cassio well and would do much
p52229
aVTo cure him of this evil
p52230
aVBut hark What noise
p52231
aVAway I say Go out and cry a mutiny
p52232
aVNay good lieutenant God\u2019s will gentlemen

aVWhy how now ho From whence ariseth this
p52246
aVAre we turned Turks and to ourselves do that
p52247
aVWhich heaven hath forbid the Ottomites
p52248
aVFor Christian shame put by this barbarous brawl
p52249
aVHe that stirs next to carve for his own rage
p52250
aVHolds his soul light he dies upon his motion
p52251
aVSilence that dreadful bell It frights the isle
p52252
aVFrom her propriety What is the matter masters
p52253
aVHonest Iago that looks dead with grieving
p52254
aVSpeak Who began this On thy love I charge thee
p52255
aVI do not know Friends all but now even now
p52256
aVIn quarter and in terms like bride and groom
p52257
aVDivesting them for bed and then but now
p52258
aVAs if some planet had unwitted men
p52259
aVSwords out and tilting one at other\u2019s breast
p52260
aVIn opposition bloody I cannot speak
p52261
aVAny beginning to this peevish odds
p52262
aVAnd would in action glorious I had lost
p52263
aVThose legs that brought me to a part of it
p52264
aVHow comes it Michael you are thus forgot
p52265
aVI pray you pardon me I cannot speak
p52266
aVWorthy Montano you were wont be civil
p52267
aVThe gravity and stillness of your youth
p52268
aVThe world hath noted And your name is great
p52269
aVIn mouths of wisest censure What\u2019s the matter
p52270
aVThat you unlace your reputation thus
p52271
aVAnd spend your rich opinion for the name
p52272
aVOf a night-brawler Give me answer to it
p52273
aVWorthy Othello I am hurt to danger
p52274
aVYour officer Iago can inform you
p52275
aVWhile I spare speech which something now offends me
p52276
aVOf all that I do know nor know I aught
p52277
aVBy me that\u2019s said or done amiss this night
p52278
aVUnless self-charity be sometimes a vice
p52279
aVAnd to defend ourselves it be a sin
p52280
aVWhen violence assails us
p52281
aVNow by heaven
p52282
aVMy blood begins my safer guides to rule
p52283
aVAnd passion having my best judgment collied
p52284
aVAssays to lead the way Zounds if I stir
p52285
aVOr do but lift this arm the best of you
p52286
aVShall sink in my rebuke Give me to know
p52287
aVHow this foul rout began who set it on
p52288
aVAnd he that is approved in this offense
p52289
aVThough he had twinned with me both at a birth
p52290
aVShall lose me What in a town of war
p52291
aVYet wild the people\u2019s hearts brimful of fear
p52292
aVTo manage private and domestic quarrel
p52293
aVIn night and on the court and guard of safety
p52294
aV\u2019Tis monstrous Iago who began \u2019t
p52295
aVIf partially affined or leagued in office
p52296
aVThou dost deliver more or less than truth
p52297
aVThou art no soldier
p52298
aVTouch me not so near
p52299
aVI had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth
p52300
aVThan it should do offense to Michael Cassio
p52301
aVYet I persuade myself to speak the truth
p52302
aVShall nothing wrong him Thus it is general
p52303
aVMontano and myself being in speech
p52304
aVThere comes a fellow crying out for help
p52305
aVAnd Cassio following him with determined sword
p52306
aVTo execute upon him Sir this gentleman
p52307
aVSteps in to Cassio and entreats his pause
p52308
aVMyself the crying fellow did pursue
p52309
aVLest by his clamor as it so fell out
p52310
aVThe town might fall in fright He swift of foot
p52311
aVOutran my purpose and I returned the rather
p52312
aVFor that I heard the clink and fall of swords
p52313
aVAnd Cassio high in oath which till tonight
p52314
aVI ne\u2019er might say before When I came back
p52315
aVFor this was brief I found them close together
p52316
aVAt blow and thrust even as again they were
p52317
aVWhen you yourself did part them
p52318
aVMore of this matter cannot I report
p52319
aVBut men are men the best sometimes forget
p52320
aVThough Cassio did some little wrong to him
p52321
aVAs men in rage strike those that wish them best
p52322
aVYet surely Cassio I believe received
p52323
aVFrom him that fled some strange indignity
p52324
aVWhich patience could not pass
p52325
aVI know Iago
p52326
aVThy honesty and love doth mince this matter
p52327
aVMaking it light to Cassio Cassio I love thee
p52328
aVBut nevermore be officer of mine
p52329
aVLook if my gentle love be not raised up
p52330
aVI\u2019ll make thee an example
p52331
aVWhat is the matter dear
p52332
aVAll\u2019s well now sweeting
p52333
aVCome away to bed To Montano Sir for your hurts
p52334
aVMyself will be your surgeon Lead him off
p52335
aVIago look with care about the town
p52336
aVAnd silence those whom this vile brawl distracted
p52337
aVCome Desdemona \u2019Tis the soldier\u2019s life
p52338
aVTo have their balmy slumbers waked with strife
p52339
aVAnd what\u2019s he then that says I play the villain
p52340
aVWhen this advice is free I give and honest
p52341
aVProbal to thinking and indeed the course
p52342
aVTo win the Moor again For \u2019tis most easy
p52343
aVTh\u2019 inclining Desdemona to subdue
p52344
aVIn any honest suit She\u2019s framed as fruitful
p52345
aVAs the free elements And then for her
p52346
aVTo win the Moor were \u2019t to renounce his baptism
p52347
aVAll seals and symbols of redeemèd sin
p52348
aVHis soul is so enfettered to her love
p52349
aVThat she may make unmake do what she list
p52350
aVEven as her appetite shall play the god
p52351
aVWith his weak function How am I then a villain
p52352
aVTo counsel Cassio to this parallel course
p52353
aVDirectly to his good Divinity of hell
p52354
aVWhen devils will the blackest sins put on
p52355
aVThey do suggest at first with heavenly shows
p52356
aVAs I do now For whiles this honest fool
p52357
aVPlies Desdemona to repair his fortune
p52358
aVAnd she for him pleads strongly to the Moor
p52359
aVI\u2019ll pour this pestilence into his ear
p52360
aVThat she repeals him for her body\u2019s lust
p52361
aVAnd by how much she strives to do him good
p52362
aVShe shall undo her credit with the Moor
p52363
aVSo will I turn her virtue into pitch
p52364
aVAnd out of her own goodness make the net
p52365
aVThat shall enmesh them all
p52366
aVHow now Roderigo
p52367
aVHow poor are they that have not patience
p52368
aVWhat wound did ever heal but by degrees
p52369
aVThou know\u2019st we work by wit and not by witchcraft
p52370
aVAnd wit depends on dilatory time
p52371
aVDoes 't not go well Cassio hath beaten thee
p52372
aVAnd thou by that small hurt hast cashiered Cassio
p52373
aVThough other things grow fair against the sun
p52374
aVYet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe
p52375
aVContent thyself awhile By th\u2019 Mass \u2019tis morning
p52376
aVPleasure and action make the hours seem short
p52377
aVRetire thee go where thou art billeted
p52378
aVAway I say Thou shalt know more hereafter
p52379
aVNay get thee gone
p52380
aVTwo things are to be done
p52381
aVMy wife must move for Cassio to her mistress
p52382
aVI\u2019ll set her on
p52383
aVMyself the while to draw the Moor apart
p52384
aVAnd bring him jump when he may Cassio find
p52385
aVSoliciting his wife Ay that\u2019s the way
p52386
aVDull not device by coldness and delay
p52387
aVMasters play here I will content your pains
p52388
aVSomething that\u2019s brief and bid Good morrow general
p52389
aVDo good my friend
p52390
aVIn happy time Iago
p52391
aVYou have not been abed then
p52392
aVWhy no The day had broke
p52393
aVBefore we parted I have made bold Iago
p52394
aVTo send in to your wife My suit to her
p52395
aVIs that she will to virtuous Desdemona
p52396
aVProcure me some access
p52397
aVI\u2019ll send her to you presently
p52398
aVAnd I\u2019ll devise a mean to draw the Moor
p52399
aVOut of the way that your converse and business
p52400
aVMay be more free
p52401
aVI humbly thank you for \u2019t Iago exits I never knew
p52402
aVA Florentine more kind and honest
p52403
aVGood morrow good lieutenant I am sorry
p52404
aVFor your displeasure but all will sure be well
p52405
aVThe General and his wife are talking of it
p52406
aVAnd she speaks for you stoutly The Moor replies
p52407
aVThat he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus
p52408
aVAnd great affinity and that in wholesome wisdom
p52409
aVHe might not but refuse you But he protests he loves you
p52410
aVAnd needs no other suitor but his likings
p52411
aVTo take the safest occasion by the front
p52412
aVTo bring you in again
p52413
aVYet I beseech you
p52414
aVIf you think fit or that it may be done
p52415
aVGive me advantage of some brief discourse
p52416
aVWith Desdemon alone
p52417
aVPray you come in
p52418
aVI will bestow you where you shall have time
p52419
aVTo speak your bosom freely
p52420
aVI am much bound to you
p52421
aVThese letters give Iago to the pilot
p52422
aVAnd by him do my duties to the Senate
p52423
aVThat done I will be walking on the works
p52424
aVRepair there to me
p52425
aVWell my good lord I\u2019ll do \u2019t
p52426
aVThis fortification gentlemen shall we see \u2019t
p52427
aVWe wait upon your Lordship
p52428
aVBe thou assured good Cassio I will do
p52429
aVAll my abilities in thy behalf
p52430
aVGood madam do I warrant it grieves my husband
p52431
aVAs if the cause were his
p52432
aVO that\u2019s an honest fellow Do not doubt Cassio
p52433
aVBut I will have my lord and you again
p52434
aVAs friendly as you were
p52435
aVBounteous madam
p52436
aVWhatever shall become of Michael Cassio
p52437
aVHe\u2019s never anything but your true servant
p52438
aVI know \u2019t I thank you You do love my lord
p52439
aVYou have known him long and be you well assured
p52440
aVHe shall in strangeness stand no farther off
p52441
aVThan in a politic distance
p52442
aVAy but lady
p52443
aVThat policy may either last so long
p52444
aVOr feed upon such nice and waterish diet
p52445
aVOr breed itself so out of circumstance
p52446
aVThat I being absent and my place supplied
p52447

aVI prithee name the time but let it not
p52498
aVExceed three days In faith he\u2019s penitent
p52499
aVAnd yet his trespass in our common reason

aVT\u2019 incur a private check When shall he come
p52503
aVTell me Othello I wonder in my soul
p52504
aVWhat you would ask me that I should deny
p52505
aVOr stand so mamm\u2019ring on What Michael Cassio
p52506
aVThat came a-wooing with you and so many a time
p52507
aVWhen I have spoke of you dispraisingly
p52508
aVHath ta\u2019en your part to have so much to do
p52509
aVTo bring him in By \u2019r Lady I could do much
p52510
aVPrithee no more Let him come when he will
p52511
aVI will deny thee nothing
p52512
aVWhy this is not a boon
p52513
aV\u2019Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves
p52514
aVOr feed on nourishing dishes or keep you warm
p52515
aVOr sue to you to do a peculiar profit
p52516
aVTo your own person Nay when I have a suit
p52517
aVWherein I mean to touch your love indeed
p52518
aVIt shall be full of poise and difficult weight
p52519
aVAnd fearful to be granted
p52520
aVI will deny thee nothing
p52521
aVWhereon I do beseech thee grant me this
p52522
aVTo leave me but a little to myself
p52523
aVShall I deny you No Farewell my lord
p52524
aVFarewell my Desdemona I\u2019ll come to thee straight
p52525
aVEmilia come Be as your fancies teach you

aVWhate\u2019er you be I am obedient
p52527
aVExcellent wretch Perdition catch my soul
p52528
aVBut I do love thee And when I love thee not
p52529
aVChaos is come again
p52530
aVMy noble lord
p52531
aVWhat dost thou say Iago
p52532
aVDid Michael Cassio
p52533
aVWhen you wooed my lady know of your love
p52534
aVHe did from first to last Why dost thou ask
p52535
aVBut for a satisfaction of my thought
p52536
aVNo further harm
p52537
aVWhy of thy thought Iago
p52538
aVI did not think he had been acquainted with her
p52539
aVO yes and went between us very oft
p52540
aVIndeed
p52541
aVIndeed Ay indeed Discern\u2019st thou aught in that
p52542
aVIs he not honest
p52543
aVHonest my lord
p52544
aVHonest ay honest
p52545
aVMy lord for aught I know
p52546
aVWhat dost thou think
p52547
aVThink my lord
p52548
aVThink my lord By heaven thou echo\u2019st me
p52549
aVAs if there were some monster in thy thought
p52550
aVToo hideous to be shown Thou dost mean something
p52551
aVI heard thee say even now thou lik\u2019st not that
p52552
aVWhen Cassio left my wife What didst not like
p52553
aVAnd when I told thee he was of my counsel
p52554
aVIn my whole course of wooing thou cried\u2019st Indeed
p52555
aVAnd didst contract and purse thy brow together
p52556
aVAs if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain
p52557
aVSome horrible conceit If thou dost love me
p52558
aVShow me thy thought
p52559
aVMy lord you know I love you
p52560
aVI think thou dost
p52561
aVAnd for I know thou \u2019rt full of love and honesty
p52562
aVAnd weigh\u2019st thy words before thou giv\u2019st them breath
p52563
aVTherefore these stops of thine fright me the more
p52564
aVFor such things in a false disloyal knave
p52565
aVAre tricks of custom but in a man that\u2019s just
p52566
aVThey\u2019re close dilations working from the heart
p52567
aVThat passion cannot rule
p52568
aVFor Michael Cassio
p52569
aVI dare be sworn I think that he is honest
p52570
aVI think so too
p52571
aVMen should be what they seem
p52572
aVOr those that be not would they might seem none
p52573
aVCertain men should be what they seem
p52574
aVWhy then I think Cassio\u2019s an honest man
p52575
aVNay yet there\u2019s more in this
p52576
aVI prithee speak to me as to thy thinkings
p52577
aVAs thou dost ruminate and give thy worst of thoughts
p52578
aVThe worst of words
p52579
aVGood my lord pardon me
p52580
aVThough I am bound to every act of duty
p52581
aVI am not bound to that all slaves are free to
p52582
aVUtter my thoughts Why say they are vile and false
p52583
aVAs where\u2019s that palace whereinto foul things
p52584
aVSometimes intrude not Who has that breast so pure
p52585
aVBut some uncleanly apprehensions
p52586
aVKeep leets and law days and in sessions sit
p52587
aVWith meditations lawful
p52588
aVThou dost conspire against thy friend Iago
p52589
aVIf thou but think\u2019st him wronged and mak\u2019st his ear
p52590
aVA stranger to thy thoughts
p52591
aVI do beseech you
p52592
aVThough I perchance am vicious in my guess
p52593
aVAs I confess it is my nature\u2019s plague
p52594
aVTo spy into abuses and oft my jealousy
p52595
aVShapes faults that are not that your wisdom
p52596
aVFrom one that so imperfectly conceits
p52597
aVWould take no notice nor build yourself a trouble
p52598
aVOut of his scattering and unsure observance
p52599
aVIt were not for your quiet nor your good
p52600
aVNor for my manhood honesty and wisdom
p52601
aVTo let you know my thoughts
p52602
aVWhat dost thou mean
p52603
aVGood name in man and woman dear my lord
p52604
aVIs the immediate jewel of their souls
p52605
aVWho steals my purse steals trash \u2019Tis something nothing
p52606
aV\u2019Twas mine \u2019tis his and has been slave to thousands
p52607
aVBut he that filches from me my good name
p52608
aVRobs me of that which not enriches him
p52609
aVAnd makes me poor indeed
p52610
aVBy heaven I\u2019ll know thy thoughts
p52611
aVYou cannot if my heart were in your hand
p52612
aVNor shall not whilst \u2019tis in my custody
p52613
aVHa
p52614
aVO beware my lord of jealousy
p52615
aVIt is the green-eyed monster which doth mock
p52616
aVThe meat it feeds on That cuckold lives in bliss
p52617
aVWho certain of his fate loves not his wronger
p52618
aVBut O what damnèd minutes tells he o\u2019er
p52619
aVWho dotes yet doubts suspects yet strongly loves
p52620
aVO misery
p52621
aVPoor and content is rich and rich enough
p52622
aVBut riches fineless is as poor as winter
p52623
aVTo him that ever fears he shall be poor
p52624
aVGood God the souls of all my tribe defend
p52625
aVFrom jealousy
p52626
aVWhy why is this
p52627
aVThink\u2019st thou I\u2019d make a life of jealousy
p52628
aVTo follow still the changes of the moon
p52629
aVWith fresh suspicions No To be once in doubt
p52630
aVIs once to be resolved Exchange me for a goat
p52631
aVWhen I shall turn the business of my soul
p52632
aVTo such exsufflicate and blown surmises
p52633
aVMatching thy inference \u2019Tis not to make me jealous
p52634
aVTo say my wife is fair feeds well loves company
p52635
aVIs free of speech sings plays and dances well
p52636
aVWhere virtue is these are more virtuous
p52637
aVNor from mine own weak merits will I draw
p52638
aVThe smallest fear or doubt of her revolt
p52639
aVFor she had eyes and chose me No Iago
p52640
aVI\u2019ll see before I doubt when I doubt prove
p52641
aVAnd on the proof there is no more but this
p52642
aVAway at once with love or jealousy
p52643
aVI am glad of this for now I shall have reason
p52644
aVTo show the love and duty that I bear you
p52645
aVWith franker spirit Therefore as I am bound
p52646
aVReceive it from me I speak not yet of proof
p52647
aVLook to your wife observe her well with Cassio
p52648
aVWear your eyes thus not jealous nor secure
p52649
aVI would not have your free and noble nature
p52650
aVOut of self-bounty be abused Look to \u2019t
p52651
aVI know our country disposition well
p52652
aVIn Venice they do let God see the pranks
p52653
aVThey dare not show their husbands Their best conscience
p52654
aVIs not to leave \u2019t undone but keep \u2019t unknown
p52655
aVDost thou say so
p52656
aVShe did deceive her father marrying you
p52657
aVAnd when she seemed to shake and fear your looks
p52658
aVShe loved them most
p52659
aVAnd so she did
p52660
aVWhy go to then
p52661
aVShe that so young could give out such a seeming
p52662
aVTo seel her father\u2019s eyes up close as oak
p52663
aVHe thought \u2019twas witchcraft But I am much to blame
p52664
aVI humbly do beseech you of your pardon
p52665
aVFor too much loving you
p52666
aVI am bound to thee forever
p52667
aVI see this hath a little dashed your spirits
p52668
aVNot a jot not a jot
p52669
aVI\u2019 faith I fear it has
p52670
aVI hope you will consider what is spoke
p52671
aVComes from my love But I do see you\u2019re moved
p52672
aVI am to pray you not to strain my speech
p52673
aVTo grosser issues nor to larger reach
p52674
aVThan to suspicion
p52675
aVI will not
p52676
aVShould you do so my lord
p52677
aVMy speech should fall into such vile success
p52678
aVAs my thoughts aim not at Cassio\u2019s my worthy friend
p52679
aVMy lord I see you\u2019re moved
p52680
aVNo not much moved
p52681
aVI do not think but Desdemona\u2019s honest
p52682
aVLong live she so And long live you to think so
p52683
aVAnd yet how nature erring from itself
p52684
aVAy there\u2019s the point As to be bold with you
p52685
aVNot to affect many proposèd matches
p52686
aVOf her own clime complexion and degree
p52687
aVWhereto we see in all things nature tends
p52688
aVFoh One may smell in such a will most rank
p52689
aVFoul disproportion thoughts unnatural
p52690
aVBut pardon me I do not in position
p52691
aVDistinctly speak of her though I may fear
p52692
aVHer will recoiling to her better judgment
p52693
aVMay fall to match you with her country forms
p52694
aVAnd happily repent
p52695
aVFarewell farewell
p52696
aVIf more thou dost perceive let me know more
p52697
aVSet on thy wife to observe Leave me Iago
p52698
aVMy lord I take my leave
p52699
aVWhy did I marry This honest creature doubtless
p52700
aVSees and knows more much more than he unfolds
p52701
aVMy lord I would I might entreat your Honor
p52702
aVTo scan this thing no farther Leave it to time
p52703
aVAlthough \u2019tis fit that Cassio have his place
p52704
aVFor sure he fills it up with great ability
p52705
aVYet if you please to hold him off awhile
p52706
aVYou shall by that perceive him and his means
p52707
aVNote if your lady strain his entertainment
p52708
aVWith any strong or vehement importunity
p52709
aVMuch will be seen in that In the meantime
p52710
aVLet me be thought too busy in my fears
p52711
aVAs worthy cause I have to fear I am
p52712
aVAnd hold her free I do beseech your Honor
p52713
aVFear not my government
p52714
aVI once more take my leave
p52715
aVThis fellow\u2019s of exceeding honesty
p52716
aVAnd knows all qualities with a learnèd spirit
p52717
aVOf human dealings If I do prove her haggard
p52718
aVThough that her jesses were my dear heartstrings
p52719
aVI\u2019d whistle her off and let her down the wind
p52720
aVTo prey at fortune Haply for I am black
p52721
aVAnd have not those soft parts of conversation
p52722
aVThat chamberers have or for I am declined
p52723
aVInto the vale of years yet that\u2019s not much
p52724
aVShe\u2019s gone I am abused and my relief
p52725
aVMust be to loathe her O curse of marriage
p52726
aVThat we can call these delicate creatures ours
p52727
aVAnd not their appetites I had rather be a toad
p52728
aVAnd live upon the vapor of a dungeon
p52729
aVThan keep a corner in the thing I love
p52730
aVFor others\u2019 uses Yet \u2019tis the plague of great ones
p52731
aVPrerogatived are they less than the base
p52732
aV\u2019Tis destiny unshunnable like death
p52733
aVEven then this forkèd plague is fated to us
p52734
aVWhen we do quicken Look where she comes
p52735
aVIf she be false heaven mocks itself
p52736
aVI\u2019ll not believe \u2019t
p52737
aVHow now my dear Othello
p52738
aVYour dinner and the generous islanders
p52739

aVI have a pain upon my forehead here
p52743
aVFaith that\u2019s with watching \u2019Twill away again

aVIt will be well
p52746
aVYour napkin is too little
p52747
aVLet it alone
p52748
aVCome I\u2019ll go in with you
p52749
aVI am very sorry that you are not well
p52750
aVI am glad I have found this napkin
p52751
aVThis was her first remembrance from the Moor
p52752
aVMy wayward husband hath a hundred times
p52753
aVWooed me to steal it But she so loves the token
p52754
aVFor he conjured her she should ever keep it
p52755
aVThat she reserves it evermore about her
p52756
aVTo kiss and talk to I\u2019ll have the work ta\u2019en out
p52757
aVAnd give \u2019t Iago What he will do with it
p52758
aVHeaven knows not I
p52759
aVI nothing but to please his fantasy
p52760
aVHow now What do you here alone
p52761
aVDo not you chide I have a thing for you
p52762
aVYou have a thing for me It is a common thing
p52763
aVHa
p52764
aVTo have a foolish wife
p52765
aVO is that all What will you give me now
p52766
aVFor that same handkerchief
p52767
aVWhat handkerchief
p52768
aVWhat handkerchief
p52769
aVWhy that the Moor first gave to Desdemona
p52770
aVThat which so often you did bid me steal
p52771
aVHast stol\u2019n it from her
p52772
aVNo faith she let it drop by negligence
p52773
aVAnd to th\u2019 advantage I being here took \u2019t up
p52774
aVLook here \u2019tis
p52775
aVA good wench Give it me
p52776
aVWhat will you do with \u2019t that you have been so earnest
p52777
aVTo have me filch it
p52778
aVWhy what is that to you
p52779
aVIf it be not for some purpose of import
p52780
aVGive \u2019t me again Poor lady she\u2019ll run mad

aVBe not acknown on \u2019t
p52783
aVI have use for it Go leave me
p52784
aVI will in Cassio\u2019s lodging lose this napkin
p52785
aVAnd let him find it Trifles light as air
p52786
aVAre to the jealous confirmations strong
p52787
aVAs proofs of holy writ This may do something
p52788
aVThe Moor already changes with my poison
p52789
aVDangerous conceits are in their natures poisons
p52790
aVWhich at the first are scarce found to distaste
p52791
aVBut with a little act upon the blood
p52792
aVBurn like the mines of sulfur
p52793
aVI did say so
p52794
aVLook where he comes Not poppy nor mandragora
p52795
aVNor all the drowsy syrups of the world
p52796
aVShall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep
p52797
aVWhich thou owedst yesterday
p52798
aVHa ha false to me
p52799
aVWhy how now general No more of that
p52800
aVAvaunt Begone Thou hast set me on the rack
p52801
aVI swear \u2019tis better to be much abused

aVThan but to know \u2019t a little
p52803
aVHow now my lord
p52804
aVWhat sense had I of her stol\u2019n hours of lust
p52805
aVI saw \u2019t not thought it not it harmed not me
p52806
aVI slept the next night well fed well was free and merry
p52807
aVI found not Cassio\u2019s kisses on her lips
p52808
aVHe that is robbed not wanting what is stol\u2019n
p52809
aVLet him not know \u2019t and he\u2019s not robbed at all
p52810
aVI am sorry to hear this
p52811
aVI had been happy if the general camp

aVIf thou dost slander her and torture me
p52836
aVNever pray more Abandon all remorse
p52837
aVOn horror\u2019s head horrors accumulate
p52838
aVDo deeds to make heaven weep all Earth amazed
p52839
aVFor nothing canst thou to damnation add
p52840
aVGreater than that
p52841
aVO grace O heaven forgive me
p52842
aVAre you a man Have you a soul or sense
p52843
aVGod b\u2019 wi\u2019 you Take mine office O wretched fool
p52844
aVThat liv\u2019st to make thine honesty a vice
p52845
aVO monstrous world Take note take note O world
p52846
aVTo be direct and honest is not safe
p52847
aVI thank you for this profit and from hence
p52848
aVI\u2019ll love no friend sith love breeds such offense
p52849
aVNay stay Thou shouldst be honest
p52850
aVI should be wise for honesty\u2019s a fool
p52851
aVAnd loses that it works for
p52852
aVBy the world
p52853
aVI think my wife be honest and think she is not
p52854
aVI think that thou art just and think thou art not
p52855
aVI\u2019ll have some proof Her name that was as fresh
p52856
aVAs Dian\u2019s visage is now begrimed and black
p52857
aVAs mine own face If there be cords or knives
p52858
aVPoison or fire or suffocating streams
p52859
aVI\u2019ll not endure it Would I were satisfied
p52860
aVI see you are eaten up with passion
p52861
aVI do repent me that I put it to you
p52862
aVYou would be satisfied
p52863
aVWould Nay and I will
p52864
aVAnd may but how How satisfied my lord
p52865
aVWould you the supervisor grossly gape on
p52866
aVBehold her topped
p52867
aVDeath and damnation O
p52868
aVIt were a tedious difficulty I think
p52869
aVTo bring them to that prospect Damn them then
p52870
aVIf ever mortal eyes do see them bolster
p52871
aVMore than their own What then How then
p52872
aVWhat shall I say Where\u2019s satisfaction
p52873
aVIt is impossible you should see this
p52874
aVWere they as prime as goats as hot as monkeys
p52875
aVAs salt as wolves in pride and fools as gross
p52876
aVAs ignorance made drunk But yet I say
p52877
aVIf imputation and strong circumstances
p52878
aVWhich lead directly to the door of truth
p52879
aVWill give you satisfaction you might have \u2019t
p52880
aVGive me a living reason she\u2019s disloyal
p52881
aVI do not like the office
p52882
aVBut sith I am entered in this cause so far
p52883
aVPricked to \u2019t by foolish honesty and love
p52884
aVI will go on I lay with Cassio lately
p52885
aVAnd being troubled with a raging tooth
p52886
aVI could not sleep There are a kind of men
p52887
aVSo loose of soul that in their sleeps will mutter
p52888
aVTheir affairs One of this kind is Cassio
p52889
aVIn sleep I heard him say Sweet Desdemona
p52890
aVLet us be wary let us hide our loves
p52891
aVAnd then sir would he gripe and wring my hand
p52892
aVCry O sweet creature then kiss me hard
p52893
aVAs if he plucked up kisses by the roots
p52894
aVThat grew upon my lips then laid his leg
p52895
aVO\u2019er my thigh and sighed and kissed and then
p52896
aVCried Cursèd fate that gave thee to the Moor
p52897
aVO monstrous Monstrous
p52898
aVNay this was but his dream
p52899
aVBut this denoted a foregone conclusion
p52900
aV\u2019Tis a shrewd doubt though it be but a dream
p52901
aVAnd this may help to thicken other proofs
p52902
aVThat do demonstrate thinly
p52903
aVI\u2019ll tear her all to pieces
p52904
aVNay but be wise Yet we see nothing done
p52905
aVShe may be honest yet Tell me but this
p52906
aVHave you not sometimes seen a handkerchief
p52907
aVSpotted with strawberries in your wife\u2019s hand
p52908
aVI gave her such a one \u2019Twas my first gift
p52909
aVI know not that but such a handkerchief
p52910
aVI am sure it was your wife\u2019s did I today
p52911
aVSee Cassio wipe his beard with
p52912
aVIf it be that
p52913
aVIf it be that or any that was hers
p52914
aVIt speaks against her with the other proofs
p52915
aVO that the slave had forty thousand lives
p52916
aVOne is too poor too weak for my revenge
p52917
aVNow do I see \u2019tis true Look here Iago
p52918
aVAll my fond love thus do I blow to heaven
p52919
aV\u2019Tis gone
p52920
aVArise black vengeance from the hollow hell
p52921
aVYield up O love thy crown and hearted throne
p52922
aVTo tyrannous hate Swell bosom with thy fraught
p52923
aVFor \u2019tis of aspics\u2019 tongues
p52924
aVYet be content
p52925
aVO blood blood blood

p52929
aVNe\u2019er feels retiring ebb but keeps due on
p52930
aVTo the Propontic and the Hellespont
p52931
aVEven so my bloody thoughts with violent pace

aVShall ne\u2019er look back ne\u2019er ebb to humble love
p52933
aVTill that a capable and wide revenge
p52934
aVSwallow them up He kneels Now by yond marble heaven
p52935
aVIn the due reverence of a sacred vow
p52936
aVI here engage my words
p52937
aVDo not rise yet
p52938
aVWitness you ever-burning lights above
p52939
aVYou elements that clip us round about
p52940
aVWitness that here Iago doth give up
p52941
aVThe execution of his wit hands heart
p52942
aVTo wronged Othello\u2019s service Let him command
p52943
aVAnd to obey shall be in me remorse
p52944
aVWhat bloody business ever
p52945
aVI greet thy love
p52946
aVNot with vain thanks but with acceptance bounteous
p52947
aVAnd will upon the instant put thee to \u2019t
p52948
aVWithin these three days let me hear thee say
p52949
aVThat Cassio\u2019s not alive
p52950
aVMy friend is dead
p52951
aV\u2019Tis done at your request But let her live
p52952
aVDamn her lewd minx O damn her damn her
p52953
aVCome go with me apart I will withdraw
p52954
aVTo furnish me with some swift means of death
p52955
aVFor the fair devil Now art thou my lieutenant
p52956
aVI am your own forever
p52957
aVWhere should I lose that handkerchief Emilia
p52958
aVI know not madam
p52959
aVBelieve me I had rather have lost my purse
p52960
aVFull of crusadoes And but my noble Moor
p52961
aVIs true of mind and made of no such baseness
p52962
aVAs jealous creatures are it were enough
p52963
aVTo put him to ill thinking
p52964
aVIs he not jealous
p52965
aVWho he I think the sun where he was born
p52966
aVDrew all such humors from him
p52967
aVLook where he comes
p52968
aVI will not leave him now till Cassio
p52969
aVBe called to him How is \u2019t with you my lord
p52970
aVWell my good lady Aside O hardness to dissemble
p52971
aVHow do you Desdemona
p52972
aVWell my good lord
p52973
aVGive me your hand He takes her hand This hand is moist my lady
p52974
aVIt yet has felt no age nor known no sorrow
p52975
aVThis argues fruitfulness and liberal heart
p52976
aVHot hot and moist This hand of yours requires
p52977
aVA sequester from liberty fasting and prayer
p52978
aVMuch castigation exercise devout
p52979
aVFor here\u2019s a young and sweating devil here
p52980
aVThat commonly rebels \u2019Tis a good hand
p52981
aVA frank one
p52982
aVYou may indeed say so
p52983
aVFor \u2019twas that hand that gave away my heart
p52984
aVA liberal hand The hearts of old gave hands
p52985
aVBut our new heraldry is hands not hearts
p52986
aVI cannot speak of this Come now your promise
p52987
aVWhat promise chuck
p52988
aVI have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you
p52989
aVI have a salt and sorry rheum offends me
p52990
aVLend me thy handkerchief
p52991
aVHere my lord
p52992
aVThat which I gave you
p52993
aVI have it not about me
p52994
aVNot
p52995
aVNo faith my lord
p52996
aVThat\u2019s a fault That handkerchief
p52997
aVDid an Egyptian to my mother give
p52998
aVShe was a charmer and could almost read
p52999
aVThe thoughts of people She told her while she kept it
p53000
aV\u2019Twould make her amiable and subdue my father
p53001
aVEntirely to her love But if she lost it
p53002
aVOr made a gift of it my father\u2019s eye
p53003
aVShould hold her loathèd and his spirits should hunt
p53004
aVAfter new fancies She dying gave it me
p53005
aVAnd bid me when my fate would have me wived
p53006
aVTo give it her I did so and take heed on \u2019t
p53007
aVMake it a darling like your precious eye
p53008
aVTo lose \u2019t or give \u2019t away were such perdition
p53009
aVAs nothing else could match
p53010
aVIs \u2019t possible
p53011
aV\u2019Tis true There\u2019s magic in the web of it
p53012
aVA sybil that had numbered in the world
p53013
aVThe sun to course two hundred compasses
p53014
aVIn her prophetic fury sewed the work
p53015
aVThe worms were hallowed that did breed the silk
p53016
aVAnd it was dyed in mummy which the skillful
p53017
aVConserved of maidens\u2019 hearts
p53018
aVI\u2019 faith is \u2019t true
p53019
aVMost veritable Therefore look to \u2019t well
p53020
aVThen would to God that I had never seen \u2019t
p53021
aVHa Wherefore
p53022
aVWhy do you speak so startingly and rash
p53023
aVIs \u2019t lost Is \u2019t gone Speak is \u2019t out o\u2019 th\u2019 way
p53024
aVHeaven bless us
p53025
aVSay you
p53026
aVIt is not lost but what an if it were
p53027
aVHow
p53028
aVI say it is not lost
p53029
aVFetch \u2019t Let me see \u2019t
p53030
aVWhy so I can But I will not now
p53031
aVThis is a trick to put me from my suit
p53032
aVPray you let Cassio be received again
p53033
aVFetch me the handkerchief Aside My mind misgives
p53034
aVCome come
p53035
aVYou\u2019ll never meet a more sufficient man
p53036
aVThe handkerchief
p53037
aVI pray talk me of Cassio
p53038
aVThe handkerchief
p53039
aVA man that all his time
p53040
aVHath founded his good fortunes on your love
p53041
aVShared dangers with you
p53042
aVThe handkerchief
p53043
aVI\u2019 faith you are to blame
p53044
aVZounds
p53045
aVIs not this man jealous
p53046
aVI ne\u2019er saw this before
p53047
aVSure there\u2019s some wonder in this handkerchief
p53048
aVI am most unhappy in the loss of it
p53049
aV\u2019Tis not a year or two shows us a man
p53050
aVThey are all but stomachs and we all but food
p53051
aVThey eat us hungerly and when they are full
p53052
aVThey belch us
p53053
aVLook you Cassio and my husband
p53054
aVThere is no other way \u2019tis she must do \u2019t
p53055
aVAnd lo the happiness Go and importune her
p53056
aVHow now good Cassio what\u2019s the news with you
p53057
aVMadam my former suit I do beseech you
p53058
aVThat by your virtuous means I may again
p53059
aVExist and be a member of his love
p53060
aVWhom I with all the office of my heart
p53061
aVEntirely honor I would not be delayed
p53062
aVIf my offense be of such mortal kind
p53063
aVThat nor my service past nor present sorrows
p53064
aVNor purposed merit in futurity
p53065
aVCan ransom me into his love again
p53066
aVBut to know so must be my benefit
p53067
aVSo shall I clothe me in a forced content
p53068
aVAnd shut myself up in some other course
p53069
aVTo fortune\u2019s alms
p53070
aVAlas thrice-gentle Cassio
p53071
aVMy advocation is not now in tune
p53072
aVMy lord is not my lord nor should I know him
p53073
aVWere he in favor as in humor altered
p53074
aVSo help me every spirit sanctified
p53075
aVAs I have spoken for you all my best
p53076
aVAnd stood within the blank of his displeasure
p53077
aVFor my free speech You must awhile be patient
p53078
aVWhat I can do I will and more I will
p53079
aVThan for myself I dare Let that suffice you
p53080
aVIs my lord angry
p53081
aVHe went hence but now
p53082
aVAnd certainly in strange unquietness
p53083
aVCan he be angry I have seen the cannon
p53084
aVWhen it hath blown his ranks into the air
p53085
aVAnd like the devil from his very arm
p53086
aVPuffed his own brother and is he angry
p53087
aVSomething of moment then I will go meet him
p53088
aVThere\u2019s matter in \u2019t indeed if he be angry
p53089
aVI prithee do so
p53090
aVSomething sure of state
p53091
aVEither from Venice or some unhatched practice
p53092
aVMade demonstrable here in Cyprus to him
p53093
aVHath puddled his clear spirit and in such cases
p53094
aVMen\u2019s natures wrangle with inferior things
p53095
aVThough great ones are their object \u2019Tis even so
p53096
aVFor let our finger ache and it endues
p53097
aVOur other healthful members even to a sense
p53098
aVOf pain Nay we must think men are not gods
p53099
aVNor of them look for such observancy
p53100
aVAs fits the bridal Beshrew me much Emilia
p53101
aVI was unhandsome warrior as I am
p53102
aVArraigning his unkindness with my soul
p53103
aVBut now I find I had suborned the witness
p53104
aVAnd he\u2019s indicted falsely
p53105
aVPray heaven it be
p53106
aVState matters as you think and no conception
p53107
aVNor no jealous toy concerning you
p53108
aVAlas the day I never gave him cause
p53109
aVBut jealous souls will not be answered so
p53110
aVThey are not ever jealous for the cause
p53111
aVBut jealous for they\u2019re jealous It is a monster
p53112
aVBegot upon itself born on itself
p53113
aVHeaven keep that monster from Othello\u2019s mind
p53114
aVLady amen
p53115
aVI will go seek him Cassio walk hereabout
p53116
aVIf I do find him fit I\u2019ll move your suit
p53117

aVStrike off this score of absence Sweet Bianca
p53132
aVTake me this work out
p53133
aVO Cassio whence came this
p53134
aVThis is some token from a newer friend
p53135
aVTo the felt absence now I feel a cause
p53136
aVIs \u2019t come to this Well well
p53137
aVGo to woman
p53138
aVThrow your vile guesses in the devil\u2019s teeth
p53139
aVFrom whence you have them You are jealous now
p53140
aVThat this is from some mistress some remembrance
p53141
aVNo by my faith Bianca

aVWhy whose is it
p53143
aVI know not neither I found it in my chamber
p53144

aVLeave you Wherefore
p53148
aVI do attend here on the General

aVAnd think it no addition nor my wish

aVTo have him see me womaned
p53151
aVWhy I pray you
p53152
aVNot that I love you not

aVI pray you bring me on the way a little
p53155
aVAnd say if I shall see you soon at night
p53156
aV\u2019Tis but a little way that I can bring you
p53157
aVFor I attend here But I\u2019ll see you soon
p53158
aV\u2019Tis very good I must be circumstanced
p53159
aVWill you think so

aVThink so Iago

aVWhat
p53162
aVTo kiss in private
p53163
aVAn unauthorized kiss
p53164
aVOr to be naked with her friend in bed
p53165
aVAn hour or more not meaning any harm
p53166
aVNaked in bed Iago and not mean harm
p53167
aVIt is hypocrisy against the devil
p53168
aVThey that mean virtuously and yet do so
p53169
aVThe devil their virtue tempts and they tempt heaven
p53170
aVIf they do nothing \u2019tis a venial slip
p53171
aVBut if I give my wife a handkerchief
p53172
aVWhat then
p53173
aVWhy then \u2019tis hers my lord and being hers
p53174
aVShe may I think bestow \u2019t on any man
p53175
aVShe is protectress of her honor too
p53176
aVMay she give that
p53177
aVHer honor is an essence that\u2019s not seen
p53178
aVThey have it very oft that have it not
p53179
aVBut for the handkerchief
p53180
aVBy heaven I would most gladly have forgot it
p53181
aVThou saidst O it comes o\u2019er my memory

p53184
aVAy what of that
p53185
aVThat\u2019s not so good now
p53186
aVWhat

aVIf I had said I had seen him do you wrong
p53188
aVOr heard him say as knaves be such abroad
p53189
aVWho having by their own importunate suit
p53190
aVOr voluntary dotage of some mistress
p53191
aVConvincèd or supplied them cannot choose

aVBut they must blab
p53193
aVHath he said anything

aVHe hath my lord but be you well assured

aVNo more than he\u2019ll unswear

aVThe lethargy must have his quiet course
p53214
aVIf not he foams at mouth and by and by
p53215
aVBreaks out to savage madness Look he stirs
p53216
aVDo you withdraw yourself a little while

aVIf wives do fall Say that they slack their duties
p53627
aVAnd pour our treasures into foreign laps
p53628
aVOr else break out in peevish jealousies
p53629
aVThrowing restraint upon us Or say they strike us
p53630
aVOr scant our former having in despite
p53631
aVWhy we have galls and though we have some grace
p53632
aVYet have we some revenge Let husbands know
p53633
aVTheir wives have sense like them They see and smell
p53634
aVAnd have their palates both for sweet and sour
p53635
aVAs husbands have What is it that they do
p53636
aVWhen they change us for others Is it sport
p53637
aVI think it is And doth affection breed it
p53638
aVI think it doth Is \u2019t frailty that thus errs
p53639
aVIt is so too And have not we affections
p53640
aVDesires for sport and frailty as men have
p53641
aVThen let them use us well Else let them know
p53642
aVThe ills we do their ills instruct us so
p53643
aVGood night good night God me such uses send

aVNot to pick bad from bad but by bad mend

aVIt must not be If Cassio do remain

aVTo ask the reason why because we bid it
p54406
aVSay is it done
p54407
aVMy lord \u2019tis done
p54408
aVEnough
p54409
aVLet your breath cool yourself telling your haste
p54410
aVThaliard adieu Till Pericles be dead
p54411
aVMy heart can lend no succor to my head
p54412
aVLet none disturb us Attendant exits Why should this change of thoughts
p54413
aVThe sad companion dull-eyed Melancholy
p54414
aVBe my so used a guest as not an hour
p54415
aVIn the day\u2019s glorious walk or peaceful night
p54416
aVThe tomb where grief should sleep can breed me quiet
p54417
aVHere pleasures court mine eyes and mine eyes shun them
p54418
aVAnd danger which I feared is at Antioch
p54419
aVWhose arm seems far too short to hit me here
p54420
aVYet neither pleasure\u2019s art can joy my spirits
p54421
aVNor yet the other\u2019s distance comfort me
p54422
aVThen it is thus the passions of the mind
p54423
aVThat have their first conception by misdread
p54424
aVHave after-nourishment and life by care
p54425
aVAnd what was first but fear what might be done
p54426
aVGrows elder now and cares it be not done
p54427
aVAnd so with me The great Antiochus
p54428
aV\u2019Gainst whom I am too little to contend
p54429
aVSince he\u2019s so great can make his will his act
p54430
aVWill think me speaking though I swear to silence
p54431
aVNor boots it me to say I honor him
p54432
aVIf he suspect I may dishonor him
p54433
aVAnd what may make him blush in being known
p54434
aVHe\u2019ll stop the course by which it might be known
p54435
aVWith hostile forces he\u2019ll o\u2019er-spread the land
p54436
aVAnd with th\u2019 ostent of war will look so huge
p54437
aVAmazement shall drive courage from the state
p54438
aVOur men be vanquished ere they do resist
p54439
aVAnd subjects punished that ne\u2019er thought offense
p54440
aVWhich care of them not pity of myself
p54441
aVWho am no more but as the tops of trees
p54442
aVWhich fence the roots they grow by and defend them
p54443
aVMakes both my body pine and soul to languish
p54444
aVAnd punish that before that he would punish
p54445
aVJoy and all comfort in your sacred breast
p54446
aVAnd keep your mind till you return to us
p54447
aVPeaceful and comfortable
p54448
aVPeace peace and give experience tongue
p54449
aVThey do abuse the King that flatter him
p54450
aVFor flattery is the bellows blows up sin
p54451
aVThe thing the which is flattered but a spark
p54452
aVTo which that wind gives heat and stronger glowing
p54453
aVWhereas reproof obedient and in order
p54454
aVFits kings as they are men for they may err
p54455
aVWhen Signior Sooth here does proclaim peace
p54456
aVHe flatters you makes war upon your life
p54457
aVPrince pardon me or strike me if you please
p54458
aVI cannot be much lower than my knees
p54459
aVAll leave us else but let your cares o\u2019erlook
p54460
aVWhat shipping and what lading\u2019s in our haven
p54461
aVAnd then return to us
p54462
aVHelicanus
p54463
aVThou hast moved us What seest thou in our looks
p54464
aVAn angry brow dread lord
p54465
aVIf there be such a dart in princes\u2019 frowns
p54466
aVHow durst thy tongue move anger to our face
p54467
aVHow dares the plants look up to heaven
p54468
aVFrom whence they have their nourishment
p54469
aVThou knowest I have power to take thy life from thee
p54470
aVI have ground the ax myself
p54471
aVDo but you strike the blow
p54472
aVRise prithee rise
p54473
aVSit down Thou art no flatterer
p54474
aVI thank thee for \u2019t and heaven forbid
p54475
aVThat kings should let their ears hear their faults hid
p54476
aVFit counselor and servant for a prince
p54477
aVWho by thy wisdom makes a prince thy servant
p54478
aVWhat wouldst thou have me do
p54479
aVTo bear with patience such griefs
p54480
aVAs you yourself do lay upon yourself
p54481
aVThou speak\u2019st like a physician Helicanus
p54482
aVThat ministers a potion unto me
p54483
aVThat thou wouldst tremble to receive thyself
p54484
aVAttend me then I went to Antioch
p54485
aVWhere as thou know\u2019st against the face of death
p54486
aVI sought the purchase of a glorious beauty
p54487
aVFrom whence an issue I might propagate
p54488
aVAre arms to princes and bring joys to subjects
p54489
aVHer face was to mine eye beyond all wonder
p54490
aVThe rest hark in thine ear as black as incest
p54491
aVWhich by my knowledge found the sinful father
p54492
aVSeemed not to strike but smooth But thou know\u2019st this
p54493
aV\u2019Tis time to fear when tyrants seems to kiss
p54494
aVWhich fear so grew in me I hither fled
p54495
aVUnder the covering of a careful night
p54496
aVWho seemed my good protector and being here
p54497
aVBethought me what was past what might succeed
p54498
aVI knew him tyrannous and tyrants\u2019 fears
p54499
aVDecrease not but grow faster than the years
p54500
aVAnd should he doubt as no doubt he doth
p54501
aVThat I should open to the list\u2019ning air
p54502
aVHow many worthy princes\u2019 bloods were shed
p54503
aVTo keep his bed of blackness unlaid ope
p54504
aVTo lop that doubt he\u2019ll fill this land with arms
p54505
aVAnd make pretense of wrong that I have done him
p54506
aVWhen all for mine if I may call \u2019t offense
p54507
aVMust feel war\u2019s blow who spares not innocence
p54508
aVWhich love to all of which thyself art one
p54509
aVWho now reproved\u2019st me for \u2019t
p54510
aVAlas sir
p54511
aVDrew sleep out of mine eyes blood from my cheeks
p54512
aVMusings into my mind with thousand doubts
p54513
aVHow I might stop this tempest ere it came
p54514
aVAnd finding little comfort to relieve them
p54515
aVI thought it princely charity to grieve for them
p54516
aVWell my lord since you have given me leave to speak
p54517
aVFreely will I speak Antiochus you fear
p54518
aVAnd justly too I think you fear the tyrant
p54519
aVWho either by public war or private treason
p54520
aVWill take away your life
p54521
aVTherefore my lord go travel for a while
p54522
aVTill that his rage and anger be forgot
p54523
aVOr till the Destinies do cut his thread of life
p54524
aVYour rule direct to any If to me
p54525
aVDay serves not light more faithful than I\u2019ll be
p54526
aVI do not doubt thy faith
p54527
aVBut should he wrong my liberties in my absence
p54528
aVWe\u2019ll mingle our bloods together in the earth
p54529
aVFrom whence we had our being and our birth
p54530
aVTyre I now look from thee then and to Tarsus
p54531
aVIntend my travel where I\u2019ll hear from thee
p54532
aVAnd by whose letters I\u2019ll dispose myself
p54533
aVThe care I had and have of subjects\u2019 good
p54534
aVOn thee I lay whose wisdom\u2019s strength can bear it
p54535
aVI\u2019ll take thy word for faith not ask thine oath
p54536
aVWho shuns not to break one will crack both
p54537
aVBut in our orbs we\u2019ll live so round and safe
p54538
aVThat time of both this truth shall ne\u2019er convince
p54539
aVThou showed\u2019st a subject\u2019s shine I a true prince
p54540
aVYou shall not need my fellow peers of Tyre
p54541
aVFurther to question me of your king\u2019s departure
p54542
aVHis sealed commission left in trust with me
p54543
aVDoes speak sufficiently he\u2019s gone to travel
p54544
aVIf further yet you will be satisfied
p54545
aVWhy as it were unlicensed of your loves
p54546
aVHe would depart I\u2019ll give some light unto you
p54547
aVBeing at Antioch
p54548
aVRoyal Antiochus on what cause I know not
p54549
aVTook some displeasure at him at least he judged so
p54550
aVAnd doubting lest he had erred or sinned
p54551
aVTo show his sorrow he\u2019d correct himself
p54552
aVSo puts himself unto the shipman\u2019s toil
p54553
aVWith whom each minute threatens life or death
p54554
aVLord Thaliard from Antiochus is welcome
p54555
aVWe have no reason to desire it
p54556
aVCommended to our master not to us
p54557
aVYet ere you shall depart this we desire
p54558
aVAs friends to Antioch we may feast in Tyre
p54559
aVMy Dionyza shall we rest us here
p54560
aVAnd by relating tales of others\u2019 griefs
p54561
aVSee if \u2019twill teach us to forget our own
p54562
aVThat were to blow at fire in hope to quench it
p54563
aVFor who digs hills because they do aspire
p54564
aVThrows down one mountain to cast up a higher
p54565
aVO my distressèd lord even such our griefs are
p54566
aVHere they are but felt and seen with mischief\u2019s eyes
p54567
aVBut like to groves being topped they higher rise
p54568
aVO Dionyza
p54569
aVWho wanteth food and will not say he wants it
p54570
aVOr can conceal his hunger till he famish
p54571
aVOur tongues and sorrows do sound deep our woes
p54572
aVInto the air our eyes do weep till lungs
p54573
aVFetch breath that may proclaim them louder that
p54574
aVIf heaven slumber while their creatures want
p54575
aVThey may awake their helpers to comfort them
p54576
aVI\u2019ll then discourse our woes felt several years
p54577
aVAnd wanting breath to speak help me with tears
p54578
aVI\u2019ll do my best sir
p54579
aVThis Tarsus o\u2019er which I have the government
p54580
aVA city on whom Plenty held full hand
p54581
aVFor Riches strewed herself even in her streets
p54582
aVWhose towers bore heads so high they kissed the clouds
p54583
aVAnd strangers ne\u2019er beheld but wondered at
p54584
aVWhose men and dames so jetted and adorned
p54585
aVLike one another\u2019s glass to trim them by
p54586
aVTheir tables were stored full to glad the sight
p54587
aVAnd not so much to feed on as delight
p54588
aVAll poverty was scorned and pride so great
p54589
aVThe name of help grew odious to repeat
p54590
aVO \u2019tis too true
p54591
aVBut see what heaven can do by this our change
p54592
aVThese mouths who but of late earth sea and air
p54593
aVWere all too little to content and please
p54594
aVAlthough they gave their creatures in abundance
p54595
aVAs houses are defiled for want of use
p54596
aVThey are now starved for want of exercise
p54597
aVThose palates who not yet two savors younger
p54598
aVMust have inventions to delight the taste
p54599
aVWould now be glad of bread and beg for it
p54600
aVThose mothers who to nuzzle up their babes
p54601
aVThought naught too curious are ready now
p54602
aVTo eat those little darlings whom they loved
p54603
aVSo sharp are hunger\u2019s teeth that man and wife
p54604
aVDraw lots who first shall die to lengthen life
p54605
aVHere stands a lord and there a lady weeping
p54606
aVHere many sink yet those which see them fall
p54607
aVHave scarce strength left to give them burial
p54608
aVIs not this true
p54609
aVOur cheeks and hollow eyes do witness it
p54610
aVO let those cities that of Plenty\u2019s cup
p54611
aVAnd her prosperities so largely taste
p54612
aVWith their superfluous riots hear these tears
p54613
aVThe misery of Tarsus may be theirs
p54614
aVWhere\u2019s the Lord Governor
p54615
aVHere
p54616
aVSpeak out thy sorrows which thee bring\u2019st in haste
p54617
aVFor comfort is too far for us to expect
p54618
aVWe have descried upon our neighboring shore
p54619
aVA portly sail of ships make hitherward
p54620
aVI thought as much
p54621
aVOne sorrow never comes but brings an heir
p54622
aVThat may succeed as his inheritor
p54623
aVAnd so in ours Some neighboring nation
p54624
aVTaking advantage of our misery
p54625
aVHath stuffed the hollow vessels with their power
p54626
aVTo beat us down the which are down already
p54627
aVAnd make a conquest of unhappy men
p54628
aVWhereas no glory\u2019s got to overcome
p54629
aVThat\u2019s the least fear for by the semblance
p54630
aVOf their white flags displayed they bring us peace
p54631
aVAnd come to us as favorers not as foes
p54632
aVThou speak\u2019st like him\u2019s untutored to repeat
p54633
aVWho makes the fairest show means most deceit
p54634
aVBut bring they what they will and what they can
p54635
aVWhat need we fear
p54636
aVThe ground\u2019s the lowest and we are halfway there
p54637
aVGo tell their general we attend him here

aVTo know for what he comes and whence he comes
p54639
aVAnd what he craves

p54645
aVBe like a beacon fired t\u2019 amaze your eyes
p54646
aVWe have heard your miseries as far as Tyre
p54647
aVAnd seen the desolation of your streets
p54648
aVNor come we to add sorrow to your tears
p54649
aVBut to relieve them of their heavy load
p54650
aVAnd these our ships you happily may think
p54651
aVAre like the Trojan horse was stuffed within
p54652
aVWith bloody veins expecting overthrow
p54653
aVAre stored with corn to make your needy bread
p54654
aVAnd give them life whom hunger starved half dead

aVA model which heaven makes like to itself
p54782
aVAs jewels lose their glory if neglected
p54783
aVSo princes their renowns if not respected
p54784
aV\u2019Tis now your honor daughter to entertain
p54785
aVThe labor of each knight in his device
p54786
aVWhich to preserve mine honor I\u2019ll perform
p54787
aVWho is the first that doth prefer himself
p54788
aVA knight of Sparta my renownèd father
p54789
aVAnd the device he bears upon his shield
p54790
aVIs a black Ethiop reaching at the sun
p54791
aVThe word Lux tua vita mihi
p54792
aVHe loves you well that holds his life of you
p54793
aVWho is the second that presents himself
p54794
aVA prince of Macedon my royal father
p54795
aVAnd the device he bears upon his shield
p54796
aVIs an armed knight that\u2019s conquered by a lady

aVThe motto thus in Spanish Pue per doleera kee per forsa
p54798
aVAnd what\u2019s the third
p54799
aVThe third of Antioch
p54800
aVAnd his device a wreath of chivalry
p54801
aVThe word Me pompae provexit apex
p54802
aVWhat is the fourth
p54803
aVA burning torch that\u2019s turnèd upside down
p54804
aVThe word Qui me alit me extinguit
p54805
aVWhich shows that beauty hath his power and will
p54806
aVWhich can as well inflame as it can kill
p54807
aVThe fifth an hand environèd with clouds
p54808
aVHolding out gold that\u2019s by the touchstone tried
p54809
aVThe motto thus Sic spectanda fides
p54810
aVAnd what\u2019s the sixth and last the which the knight himself
p54811
aVWith such a graceful courtesy delivered
p54812
aVHe seems to be a stranger but his present is
p54813
aVA withered branch that\u2019s only green at top
p54814
aVThe motto In hac spe vivo
p54815
aVA pretty moral
p54816
aVFrom the dejected state wherein he is

aVHe hopes by you his fortunes yet may flourish
p54818
aVHe had need mean better than his outward show

aVHe well may be a stranger for he comes
p54823
aVTo an honored triumph strangely furnishèd

aVWere more than you expect or more than \u2019s fit

aVHe\u2019s but a country gentleman

aVHas done no more than other knights have done
p54866
aVHas broken a staff or so So let it pass
p54867
aVTo me he seems like diamond to glass
p54868
aVYon king\u2019s to me like to my father\u2019s picture
p54869
aVWhich tells in that glory once he was
p54870
aVHad princes sit like stars about his throne
p54871
aVAnd he the sun for them to reverence
p54872
aVNone that beheld him but like lesser lights
p54873
aVDid vail their crowns to his supremacy
p54874
aVWhere now his son\u2019s like a glowworm in the night
p54875
aVThe which hath fire in darkness none in light
p54876
aVWhereby I see that Time\u2019s the king of men
p54877
aVHe\u2019s both their parent and he is their grave
p54878
aVAnd gives them what he will not what they crave
p54879

p54883
aVWe drink this health to you
p54884
aVWe thank your Grace
p54885
aVYet pause awhile Yon knight doth sit too melancholy
p54886
aVAs if the entertainment in our court
p54887
aVHad not a show might countervail his worth
p54888
aVNote it not you Thaisa
p54889
aVWhat is \u2019t to me my father
p54890
aVO attend my daughter Princes in this
p54891
aVShould live like gods above who freely give
p54892
aVTo everyone that come to honor them
p54893
aVAnd princes not doing so are like to gnats
p54894
aVWhich make a sound but killed are wondered at
p54895
aVTherefore to make his entrance more sweet
p54896
aVHere say we drink this standing-bowl of wine to him
p54897
aVAlas my father it befits not me
p54898
aVUnto a stranger knight to be so bold
p54899
aVHe may my proffer take for an offense
p54900
aVSince men take women\u2019s gifts for impudence
p54901
aVHow
p54902
aVDo as I bid you or you\u2019ll move me else
p54903
aVNow by the gods he could not please me better
p54904
aVAnd furthermore tell him we desire to know of him

aVA gentleman of Tyre my name Pericles

aVMy education been in arts and arms
p54914
aVWho looking for adventures in the world
p54915
aVWas by the rough seas reft of ships and men
p54916
aVAnd after shipwrack driven upon this shore
p54917
aVHe thanks your Grace names himself Pericles
p54918
aVA gentleman of Tyre
p54919
aVWho only by misfortune of the seas
p54920
aVBereft of ships and men cast on this shore

aVAnd will awake him from his melancholy
p54923
aVCome gentlemen we sit too long on trifles

aVAnd waste the time which looks for other revels
p54925
aVEven in your armors as you are addressed
p54926
aVWill well become a soldiers\u2019 dance
p54927
aVI will not have excuse with saying this
p54928
aVLoud music is too harsh for ladies\u2019 heads
p54929
aVSince they love men in arms as well as beds
p54930
aVSo this was well asked \u2019twas so well performed
p54931
aVCome sir
p54932
aVHere\u2019s a lady that wants breathing too
p54933
aVAnd I have heard you knights of Tyre
p54934
aVAre excellent in making ladies trip
p54935
aVAnd that their measures are as excellent
p54936
aVIn those that practice them they are my lord
p54937
aVO that\u2019s as much as you would be denied
p54938
aVOf your fair courtesy
p54939
aVUnclasp unclasp
p54940
aVThanks gentlemen to all all have done well
p54941
aVTo Pericles But you the best Pages and lights to conduct
p54942
aVThese knights unto their several lodgings

aVWe have given order be next our own
p54945
aVI am at your Grace\u2019s pleasure
p54946
aVPrinces it is too late to talk of love
p54947
aVAnd that\u2019s the mark I know you level at
p54948
aVTherefore each one betake him to his rest
p54949
aVTomorrow all for speeding do their best
p54950
aVNo Escanes know this of me
p54951
aVAntiochus from incest lived not free
p54952
aVFor which the most high gods not minding longer
p54953
aVTo withhold the vengeance that they had in store
p54954
aVDue to this heinous capital offense
p54955
aVEven in the height and pride of all his glory
p54956
aVWhen he was seated in a chariot of
p54957
aVAn inestimable value and his daughter with him
p54958
aVA fire from heaven came and shriveled up
p54959
aVThose bodies even to loathing for they so stunk
p54960
aVThat all those eyes adored them ere their fall
p54961
aVScorn now their hand should give them burial
p54962
aV\u2019Twas very strange
p54963
aVAnd yet but justice for though this king were great
p54964
aVHis greatness was no guard to bar heaven\u2019s shaft
p54965
aVBut sin had his reward
p54966
aV\u2019Tis very true
p54967
aVSee not a man in private conference
p54968
aVOr counsel has respect with him but he
p54969
aVIt shall no longer grieve without reproof
p54970
aVAnd cursed be he that will not second it
p54971
aVFollow me then Lord Helicane a word
p54972
aVWith me And welcome Happy day my lords
p54973
aVKnow that our griefs are risen to the top
p54974
aVAnd now at length they overflow their banks
p54975
aVYour griefs For what Wrong not your prince you love
p54976
aVWrong not yourself then noble Helicane
p54977
aVBut if the Prince do live let us salute him
p54978
aVOr know what ground\u2019s made happy by his breath
p54979
aVIf in the world he live we\u2019ll seek him out
p54980
aVIf in his grave he rest we\u2019ll find him there
p54981
aVAnd be resolved he lives to govern us
p54982
aVOr dead give \u2019s cause to mourn his funeral
p54983
aVAnd leave us to our free election
p54984
aVWhose death\u2019s indeed the strongest in our censure
p54985
aVAnd knowing this kingdom is without a head
p54986
aVLike goodly buildings left without a roof
p54987
aVSoon fall to ruin your noble self
p54988
aVThat best know how to rule and how to reign
p54989
aVWe thus submit unto our sovereign
p54990
aVLive noble Helicane
p54991
aVTry honor\u2019s cause forbear your suffrages
p54992
aVIf that you love Prince Pericles forbear
p54993
aVTake I your wish I leap into the seas
p54994
aVWhere\u2019s hourly trouble for a minute\u2019s ease
p54995
aVA twelve-month longer let me entreat you
p54996
aVTo forbear the absence of your king
p54997
aVIf in which time expired he not return
p54998
aVI shall with agèd patience bear your yoke
p54999
aVBut if I cannot win you to this love
p55000
aVGo search like nobles like noble subjects
p55001
aVAnd in your search spend your adventurous worth
p55002
aVWhom if you find and win unto return
p55003
aVYou shall like diamonds sit about his crown
p55004
aVTo wisdom he\u2019s a fool that will not yield
p55005
aVAnd since Lord Helicane enjoineth us
p55006
aVWe with our travels will endeavor
p55007
aVThen you love us we you and we\u2019ll clasp hands
p55008
aVWhen peers thus knit a kingdom ever stands
p55009
aVGood morrow to the good Simonides
p55010
aVKnights from my daughter this I let you know
p55011
aVThat for this twelvemonth she\u2019ll not undertake

aVA married life Her reason to herself is only known
p55013
aVWhich from her by no means can I get
p55014
aVMay we not get access to her my lord
p55015
aVFaith by no means she hath so strictly tied her
p55016
aVTo her chamber that \u2019tis impossible
p55017
aVOne twelve moons more she\u2019ll wear Diana\u2019s livery
p55018
aVThis by the eye of Cynthia hath she vowed
p55019
aVAnd on her virgin honor will not break it
p55020
aVLoath to bid farewell we take our leaves
p55021
aVSo
p55022
aVThey are well dispatched Now to my daughter\u2019s letter

aVWhat\u2019s here

aVA stranger and distressèd gentleman

aVThat never aimed so high to love your daughter

aVThou hast bewitched my daughter and thou art
p55058
aVA villain

p55662
aVWell-sailing ships and bounteous winds have brought

p55666
aVLike motes and shadows see them move awhile
p55667
aVYour ears unto your eyes I\u2019ll reconcile
p55668
aVSee how belief may suffer by foul show
p55669
aVThis borrowed passion stands for true old woe
p55670
aVAnd Pericles in sorrow all devoured
p55671
aVWith sighs shot through and biggest tears o\u2019ershowered
p55672
aVLeaves Tarsus and again embarks He swears
p55673
aVNever to wash his face nor cut his hairs

aVMarina was she called and at her birth
p55684
aVThetis being proud swallowed some part o\u2019 th\u2019 earth

aVMake raging battery upon shores of flint
p55689
aVNo visor does become black villainy
p55690
aVSo well as soft and tender flattery
p55691
aVLet Pericles believe his daughter\u2019s dead
p55692
aVAnd bear his courses to be orderèd
p55693
aVBy Lady Fortune while our scene must play

aVIn Helicanus may you well descry
p56199
aVA figure of truth of faith of loyalty
p56200
aVIn reverend Cerimon there well appears
p56201
aVThe worth that learnèd charity aye wears
p56202
aVFor wicked Cleon and his wife when fame
p56203
aVHad spread his cursèd deed to the honored name
p56204
aVOf Pericles to rage the city turn
p56205
aVThat him and his they in his palace burn
p56206
aVThe gods for murder seemèd so content

aVNew joy wait on you Here our play has ending
p56210
aVOld John of Gaunt time-honored Lancaster

aVHast thou according to thy oath and band
p56212
aVBrought hither Henry Hereford thy bold son
p56213
aVHere to make good the boist\u2019rous late appeal
p56214
aVWhich then our leisure would not let us hear
p56215
aVAgainst the Duke of Norfolk Thomas Mowbray
p56216
aVI have my liege
p56217
aVTell me moreover hast thou sounded him
p56218
aVIf he appeal the Duke on ancient malice
p56219
aVOr worthily as a good subject should
p56220
aVOn some known ground of treachery in him
p56221
aVAs near as I could sift him on that argument
p56222
aVOn some apparent danger seen in him
p56223
aVAimed at your Highness no inveterate malice
p56224
aVThen call them to our presence
p56225
aVFace to face
p56226
aVAnd frowning brow to brow ourselves will hear
p56227
aVThe accuser and the accusèd freely speak
p56228
aVHigh stomached are they both and full of ire
p56229
aVIn rage deaf as the sea hasty as fire
p56230
aVMany years of happy days befall
p56231
aVMy gracious sovereign my most loving liege
p56232
aVEach day still better other\u2019s happiness
p56233
aVUntil the heavens envying earth\u2019s good hap
p56234
aVAdd an immortal title to your crown
p56235
aVWe thank you both Yet one but flatters us
p56236
aVAs well appeareth by the cause you come
p56237
aVNamely to appeal each other of high treason
p56238
aVCousin of Hereford what dost thou object
p56239
aVAgainst the Duke of Norfolk Thomas Mowbray
p56240
aVFirst heaven be the record to my speech
p56241
aVIn the devotion of a subject\u2019s love
p56242
aVTend\u2019ring the precious safety of my prince
p56243
aVAnd free from other misbegotten hate
p56244
aVCome I appellant to this princely presence
p56245
aVNow Thomas Mowbray do I turn to thee
p56246
aVAnd mark my greeting well for what I speak
p56247
aVMy body shall make good upon this earth
p56248
aVOr my divine soul answer it in heaven
p56249
aVThou art a traitor and a miscreant
p56250
aVToo good to be so and too bad to live
p56251
aVSince the more fair and crystal is the sky
p56252
aVThe uglier seem the clouds that in it fly
p56253
aVOnce more the more to aggravate the note
p56254
aVWith a foul traitor\u2019s name stuff I thy throat
p56255
aVAnd wish so please my sovereign ere I move
p56256
aVWhat my tongue speaks my right-drawn sword may prove
p56257
aVLet not my cold words here accuse my zeal
p56258
aV\u2019Tis not the trial of a woman\u2019s war
p56259
aVThe bitter clamor of two eager tongues
p56260
aVCan arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain
p56261
aVThe blood is hot that must be cooled for this
p56262
aVYet can I not of such tame patience boast
p56263
aVAs to be hushed and naught at all to say
p56264
aVFirst the fair reverence of your Highness curbs me
p56265
aVFrom giving reins and spurs to my free speech
p56266
aVWhich else would post until it had returned
p56267
aVThese terms of treason doubled down his throat
p56268
aVSetting aside his high blood\u2019s royalty
p56269
aVAnd let him be no kinsman to my liege
p56270
aVI do defy him and I spit at him
p56271
aVCall him a slanderous coward and a villain
p56272
aVWhich to maintain I would allow him odds
p56273
aVAnd meet him were I tied to run afoot
p56274
aVEven to the frozen ridges of the Alps
p56275
aVOr any other ground inhabitable
p56276
aVWherever Englishman durst set his foot
p56277
aVMeantime let this defend my loyalty
p56278
aVBy all my hopes most falsely doth he lie
p56279
aVPale trembling coward there I throw my gage
p56280
aVDisclaiming here the kindred of the King
p56281
aVAnd lay aside my high blood\u2019s royalty
p56282
aVWhich fear not reverence makes thee to except
p56283
aVIf guilty dread have left thee so much strength
p56284
aVAs to take up mine honor\u2019s pawn then stoop
p56285
aVBy that and all the rites of knighthood else
p56286
aVWill I make good against thee arm to arm
p56287
aVWhat I have spoke or thou canst worse devise
p56288
aVI take it up and by that sword I swear
p56289
aVWhich gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder
p56290
aVI\u2019ll answer thee in any fair degree
p56291
aVOr chivalrous design of knightly trial
p56292
aVAnd when I mount alive may I not light
p56293
aVIf I be traitor or unjustly fight
p56294
aVWhat doth our cousin lay to Mowbray\u2019s charge
p56295
aVIt must be great that can inherit us
p56296
aVSo much as of a thought of ill in him
p56297
aVLook what I speak my life shall prove it true
p56298
aVThat Mowbray hath received eight thousand nobles
p56299
aVIn name of lendings for your Highness\u2019 soldiers
p56300
aVThe which he hath detained for lewd employments
p56301
aVLike a false traitor and injurious villain
p56302
aVBesides I say and will in battle prove
p56303
aVOr here or elsewhere to the furthest verge
p56304
aVThat ever was surveyed by English eye
p56305
aVThat all the treasons for these eighteen years
p56306
aVComplotted and contrivèd in this land
p56307
aVFetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring
p56308
aVFurther I say and further will maintain
p56309
aVUpon his bad life to make all this good
p56310
aVThat he did plot the Duke of Gloucester\u2019s death
p56311
aVSuggest his soon-believing adversaries
p56312
aVAnd consequently like a traitor coward
p56313
aVSluiced out his innocent soul through streams of blood
p56314
aVWhich blood like sacrificing Abel\u2019s cries
p56315
aVEven from the tongueless caverns of the earth
p56316
aVTo me for justice and rough chastisement
p56317
aVAnd by the glorious worth of my descent
p56318
aVThis arm shall do it or this life be spent
p56319
aVHow high a pitch his resolution soars
p56320
aVThomas of Norfolk what sayst thou to this
p56321
aVO let my sovereign turn away his face
p56322
aVAnd bid his ears a little while be deaf
p56323
aVTill I have told this slander of his blood
p56324
aVHow God and good men hate so foul a liar
p56325
aVMowbray impartial are our eyes and ears
p56326
aVWere he my brother nay my kingdom\u2019s heir
p56327
aVAs he is but my father\u2019s brother\u2019s son
p56328
aVNow by my scepter\u2019s awe I make a vow
p56329
aVSuch neighbor nearness to our sacred blood
p56330
aVShould nothing privilege him nor partialize
p56331
aVThe unstooping firmness of my upright soul
p56332
aVHe is our subject Mowbray so art thou
p56333
aVFree speech and fearless I to thee allow
p56334
aVThen Bolingbroke as low as to thy heart
p56335
aVThrough the false passage of thy throat thou liest
p56336
aVThree parts of that receipt I had for Calais
p56337
aVDisbursed I duly to his Highness\u2019 soldiers
p56338
aVThe other part reserved I by consent
p56339
aVFor that my sovereign liege was in my debt
p56340
aVUpon remainder of a dear account
p56341
aVSince last I went to France to fetch his queen
p56342
aVNow swallow down that lie For Gloucester\u2019s death
p56343
aVI slew him not but to my own disgrace
p56344
aVNeglected my sworn duty in that case
p56345
aVFor you my noble Lord of Lancaster
p56346
aVThe honorable father to my foe
p56347
aVOnce did I lay an ambush for your life
p56348
aVA trespass that doth vex my grievèd soul
p56349
aVBut ere I last received the sacrament
p56350
aVI did confess it and exactly begged
p56351
aVYour Grace\u2019s pardon and I hope I had it
p56352
aVThis is my fault As for the rest appealed
p56353
aVIt issues from the rancor of a villain
p56354
aVA recreant and most degenerate traitor
p56355
aVWhich in myself I boldly will defend
p56356
aVAnd interchangeably hurl down my gage
p56357
aVUpon this overweening traitor\u2019s foot
p56358
aVTo prove myself a loyal gentleman
p56359
aVEven in the best blood chambered in his bosom
p56360
aVIn haste whereof most heartily I pray
p56361
aVYour Highness to assign our trial day
p56362
aVWrath-kindled gentlemen be ruled by me
p56363
aVLet\u2019s purge this choler without letting blood

p56618
aVAnd for our eyes do hate the dire aspect
p56619
aVOf civil wounds plowed up with neighbor\u2019s sword
p56620
aVAnd for we think the eagle-wingèd pride
p56621
aVOf sky-aspiring and ambitious thoughts
p56622
aVWith rival-hating envy set on you
p56623
aVTo wake our peace which in our country\u2019s cradle
p56624
aVDraws the sweet infant breath of gentle sleep

p56632
aVTill twice five summers have enriched our fields

p56635
aVYour will be done This must my comfort be

aVThat sun that warms you here shall shine on me

aVAnd those his golden beams to you here lent

p56639
aVNorfolk for thee remains a heavier doom
p56640
aVWhich I with some unwillingness pronounce

aVAs to be cast forth in the common air

aVThe language I have learnt these forty years
p56651

p56652
aVAnd now my tongue\u2019s use is to me no more
p56653
aVThan an unstringèd viol or a harp
p56654
aVOr like a cunning instrument cased up
p56655
aVOr being open put into his hands
p56656
aVThat knows no touch to tune the harmony
p56657
aVWithin my mouth you have enjailed my tongue
p56658
aVDoubly portcullised with my teeth and lips
p56659
aVAnd dull unfeeling barren ignorance
p56660
aVIs made my jailor to attend on me
p56661
aVI am too old to fawn upon a nurse
p56662
aVToo far in years to be a pupil now
p56663
aVWhat is thy sentence then but speechless death
p56664
aVWhich robs my tongue from breathing native breath
p56665
aVIt boots thee not to be compassionate
p56666
aVAfter our sentence plaining comes too late

aV\u2019Gainst us our state our subjects or our land
p56682
aVI swear
p56683
aVAnd I to keep all this
p56684
aVNorfolk so far as to mine enemy
p56685
aVBy this time had the King permitted us
p56686
aVOne of our souls had wandered in the air
p56687
aVBanished this frail sepulcher of our flesh
p56688
aVAs now our flesh is banished from this land
p56689
aVConfess thy treasons ere thou fly the realm
p56690
aVSince thou hast far to go bear not along

aVNo Bolingbroke if ever I were traitor
p56693
aVMy name be blotted from the book of life
p56694
aVAnd I from heaven banished as from hence

aVAnd all too soon I fear the King shall rue
p56697
aVFarewell my liege Now no way can I stray

aVSave back to England all the world\u2019s my way
p56699
aVUncle even in the glasses of thine eyes

aVI see thy grievèd heart Thy sad aspect

aVReturn with welcome home from banishment
p56704
aVHow long a time lies in one little word
p56705
aVFour lagging winters and four wanton springs
p56706
aVEnd in a word such is the breath of kings
p56707
aVI thank my liege that in regard of me
p56708
aVHe shortens four years of my son\u2019s exile
p56709
aVBut little vantage shall I reap thereby
p56710
aVFor ere the six years that he hath to spend
p56711
aVCan change their moons and bring their times about
p56712
aVMy oil-dried lamp and time-bewasted light
p56713
aVShall be extinct with age and endless night
p56714
aVMy inch of taper will be burnt and done
p56715
aVAnd blindfold death not let me see my son
p56716
aVWhy uncle thou hast many years to live
p56717
aVBut not a minute king that thou canst give
p56718
aVShorten my days thou canst with sullen sorrow
p56719
aVAnd pluck nights from me but not lend a morrow
p56720
aVThou canst help time to furrow me with age
p56721
aVBut stop no wrinkle in his pilgrimage
p56722
aVThy word is current with him for my death
p56723
aVBut dead thy kingdom cannot buy my breath
p56724
aVThy son is banished upon good advice
p56725
aVWhereto thy tongue a party verdict gave
p56726
aVWhy at our justice seem\u2019st thou then to lour
p56727
aVThings sweet to taste prove in digestion sour
p56728
aVYou urged me as a judge but I had rather
p56729
aVYou would have bid me argue like a father
p56730
aVO had it been a stranger not my child
p56731
aVTo smooth his fault I should have been more mild
p56732
aVA partial slander sought I to avoid
p56733
aVAnd in the sentence my own life destroyed
p56734
aVAlas I looked when some of you should say
p56735
aVI was too strict to make mine own away
p56736
aVBut you gave leave to my unwilling tongue
p56737
aVAgainst my will to do myself this wrong
p56738
aVCousin farewell And uncle bid him so
p56739
aVSix years we banish him and he shall go

aVCousin farewell What presence must not know
p56741
aVFrom where you do remain let paper show
p56742
aVMy lord no leave take I for I will ride
p56743
aVAs far as land will let me by your side
p56744
aVO to what purpose dost thou hoard thy words
p56745
aVThat thou returnest no greeting to thy friends

aVHis charters and his customary rights
p57065
aVLet not tomorrow then ensue today

aVBut lords we hear this fearful tempest sing
p57132
aVYet seek no shelter to avoid the storm
p57133
aVWe see the wind sit sore upon our sails
p57134
aVAnd yet we strike not but securely perish
p57135
aVWe see the very wrack that we must suffer
p57136
aVAnd unavoided is the danger now
p57137
aVFor suffering so the causes of our wrack
p57138
aVNot so Even through the hollow eyes of death
p57139

aVAre making hither with all due expedience
p57155
aVAnd shortly mean to touch our northern shore
p57156
aVPerhaps they had ere this but that they stay
p57157
aVThe first departing of the King for Ireland

aVIf then we shall shake off our slavish yoke

aVTo please the King I did to please myself
p57173
aVI cannot do it Yet I know no cause

aVWhy I should welcome such a guest as grief

aVSave bidding farewell to so sweet a guest
p57176
aVAs my sweet Richard Yet again methinks
p57177
aVSome unborn sorrow ripe in Fortune\u2019s womb
p57178
aVIs coming towards me and my inward soul
p57179
aVWith nothing trembles At some thing it grieves
p57180
aVMore than with parting from my lord the King
p57181
aVEach substance of a grief hath twenty shadows
p57182
aVWhich shows like grief itself but is not so
p57183
aVFor sorrow\u2019s eyes glazed with blinding tears
p57184
aVDivides one thing entire to many objects
p57185
aVLike perspectives which rightly gazed upon

aVShow nothing but confusion eyed awry

aVOf what it is not Then thrice-gracious queen

aVOr if it be \u2019tis with false sorrow\u2019s eye

aVIt may be so but yet my inward soul
p57196
aVPersuades me it is otherwise Howe\u2019er it be

aVMakes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink
p57200
aV\u2019Tis nothing but conceit my gracious lady
p57201
aV\u2019Tis nothing less Conceit is still derived
p57202
aVFrom some forefather grief Mine is not so

aVComes rushing on this woeful land at once
p57269
aVI know not what to do I would to God

aVSo my untruth had not provoked him to it
p57271
aVThe King had cut off my head with my brother\u2019s

aVThe wind sits fair for news to go for Ireland
p57292
aVBut none returns For us to levy power
p57293
aVProportionable to the enemy
p57294
aVIs all unpossible
p57295
aVBesides our nearness to the King in love
p57296
aVIs near the hate of those love not the King
p57297
aVAnd that is the wavering commons for their love
p57298
aVLies in their purses and whoso empties them
p57299
aVBy so much fills their hearts with deadly hate
p57300
aVWherein the King stands generally condemned
p57301
aVIf judgment lie in them then so do we

aVBecause we ever have been near the King

aVThe Earl of Wiltshire is already there
p57305
aVThither will I with you for little office

aVThat\u2019s as York thrives to beat back Bolingbroke
p57313
aVAlas poor duke the task he undertakes
p57314
aVIs numb\u2019ring sands and drinking oceans dry

aVWhere one on his side fights thousands will fly
p57316
aVFarewell at once for once for all and ever
p57317
aVWell we may meet again
p57318
aVI fear me never
p57319
aVHow far is it my lord to Berkeley now
p57320
aVBelieve me noble lord
p57321
aVI am a stranger here in Gloucestershire
p57322
aVThese high wild hills and rough uneven ways
p57323
aVDraws out our miles and makes them wearisome
p57324
aVAnd yet your fair discourse hath been as sugar
p57325
aVMaking the hard way sweet and delectable
p57326
aVBut I bethink me what a weary way
p57327
aVFrom Ravenspurgh to Cotshall will be found
p57328
aVIn Ross and Willoughby wanting your company
p57329
aVWhich I protest hath very much beguiled
p57330
aVThe tediousness and process of my travel
p57331
aVBut theirs is sweetened with the hope to have
p57332
aVThe present benefit which I possess
p57333
aVAnd hope to joy is little less in joy
p57334
aVThan hope enjoyed By this the weary lords
p57335
aVShall make their way seem short as mine hath done
p57336
aVBy sight of what I have your noble company
p57337
aVOf much less value is my company
p57338
aVThan your good words But who comes here
p57339
aVIt is my son young Harry Percy
p57340
aVSent from my brother Worcester whencesoever
p57341
aVHarry how fares your uncle
p57342
aVI had thought my lord to have learned his health of you
p57343
aVWhy is he not with the Queen
p57344
aVNo my good lord he hath forsook the court
p57345
aVBroken his staff of office and dispersed
p57346
aVThe Household of the King
p57347
aVWhat was his reason He was not so resolved
p57348
aVWhen last we spake together
p57349
aVBecause your Lordship was proclaimèd traitor
p57350
aVBut he my lord is gone to Ravenspurgh
p57351
aVTo offer service to the Duke of Hereford
p57352
aVAnd sent me over by Berkeley to discover
p57353
aVWhat power the Duke of York had levied there
p57354
aVThen with directions to repair to Ravenspurgh
p57355
aVHave you forgot the Duke of Hereford boy
p57356
aVNo my good lord for that is not forgot
p57357
aVWhich ne\u2019er I did remember To my knowledge
p57358
aVI never in my life did look on him
p57359
aVThen learn to know him now This is the Duke
p57360
aVMy gracious lord I tender you my service
p57361
aVSuch as it is being tender raw and young
p57362
aVWhich elder days shall ripen and confirm
p57363
aVTo more approvèd service and desert
p57364
aVI thank thee gentle Percy and be sure
p57365
aVI count myself in nothing else so happy
p57366
aVAs in a soul rememb\u2019ring my good friends
p57367
aVAnd as my fortune ripens with thy love
p57368
aVIt shall be still thy true love\u2019s recompense
p57369
aVMy heart this covenant makes my hand thus seals it
p57370
aVHow far is it to Berkeley and what stir
p57371
aVKeeps good old York there with his men of war
p57372
aVThere stands the castle by yon tuft of trees
p57373
aVManned with three hundred men as I have heard
p57374
aVAnd in it are the Lords of York Berkeley and Seymour
p57375
aVNone else of name and noble estimate
p57376
aVHere come the Lords of Ross and Willoughby
p57377
aVBloody with spurring fiery red with haste
p57378
aVWelcome my lords I wot your love pursues
p57379
aVA banished traitor All my treasury
p57380
aVIs yet but unfelt thanks which more enriched
p57381
aVShall be your love and labor\u2019s recompense
p57382
aVYour presence makes us rich most noble lord
p57383
aVAnd far surmounts our labor to attain it
p57384
aVEvermore thank\u2019s the exchequer of the poor
p57385
aVWhich till my infant fortune comes to years
p57386
aVStands for my bounty But who comes here
p57387
aVIt is my Lord of Berkeley as I guess
p57388
aVMy Lord of Hereford my message is to you
p57389
aVMy lord my answer is to Lancaster
p57390
aVAnd I am come to seek that name in England
p57391
aVAnd I must find that title in your tongue
p57392
aVBefore I make reply to aught you say
p57393
aVMistake me not my lord \u2019tis not my meaning
p57394
aVTo rase one title of your honor out
p57395
aVTo you my lord I come what lord you will
p57396
aVFrom the most gracious regent of this land
p57397
aVThe Duke of York to know what pricks you on
p57398
aVTo take advantage of the absent time
p57399
aVAnd fright our native peace with self-borne arms
p57400
aVI shall not need transport my words by you
p57401
aVHere comes his Grace in person
p57402
aVMy noble uncle
p57403
aVShow me thy humble heart and not thy knee
p57404
aVWhose duty is deceivable and false
p57405
aVMy gracious uncle
p57406
aVTut tut
p57407
aVGrace me no grace nor uncle me no uncle
p57408
aVI am no traitor\u2019s uncle and that word grace
p57409
aVIn an ungracious mouth is but profane
p57410
aVWhy have those banished and forbidden legs
p57411
aVDared once to touch a dust of England\u2019s ground
p57412
aVBut then more why why have they dared to march
p57413
aVSo many miles upon her peaceful bosom
p57414
aVFrighting her pale-faced villages with war
p57415
aVAnd ostentation of despisèd arms
p57416
aVCom\u2019st thou because the anointed king is hence
p57417
aVWhy foolish boy the King is left behind
p57418
aVAnd in my loyal bosom lies his power
p57419
aVWere I but now lord of such hot youth
p57420
aVAs when brave Gaunt thy father and myself
p57421
aVRescued the Black Prince that young Mars of men
p57422
aVFrom forth the ranks of many thousand French
p57423
aVO then how quickly should this arm of mine
p57424
aVNow prisoner to the palsy chastise thee
p57425
aVAnd minister correction to thy fault
p57426
aVMy gracious uncle let me know my fault
p57427
aVOn what condition stands it and wherein
p57428
aVEven in condition of the worst degree
p57429
aVIn gross rebellion and detested treason
p57430
aVThou art a banished man and here art come
p57431
aVBefore the expiration of thy time
p57432
aVIn braving arms against thy sovereign
p57433
aVAs I was banished I was banished Hereford
p57434
aVBut as I come I come for Lancaster
p57435
aVAnd noble uncle I beseech your Grace
p57436
aVLook on my wrongs with an indifferent eye
p57437
aVYou are my father for methinks in you
p57438
aVI see old Gaunt alive O then my father
p57439
aVWill you permit that I shall stand condemned
p57440
aVA wandering vagabond my rights and royalties
p57441
aVPlucked from my arms perforce and given away
p57442
aVTo upstart unthrifts Wherefore was I born
p57443
aVIf that my cousin king be king in England
p57444
aVIt must be granted I am Duke of Lancaster
p57445
aVYou have a son Aumerle my noble cousin
p57446
aVHad you first died and he been thus trod down
p57447
aVHe should have found his uncle Gaunt a father
p57448
aVTo rouse his wrongs and chase them to the bay
p57449
aVI am denied to sue my livery here
p57450
aVAnd yet my letters patents give me leave
p57451
aVMy father\u2019s goods are all distrained and sold
p57452
aVAnd these and all are all amiss employed
p57453
aVWhat would you have me do I am a subject
p57454
aVAnd I challenge law Attorneys are denied me
p57455
aVAnd therefore personally I lay my claim
p57456
aVTo my inheritance of free descent
p57457
aVThe noble duke hath been too much abused
p57458
aVIt stands your Grace upon to do him right
p57459
aVBase men by his endowments are made great
p57460
aVMy lords of England let me tell you this
p57461
aVI have had feeling of my cousin\u2019s wrongs
p57462
aVAnd labored all I could to do him right
p57463
aVBut in this kind to come in braving arms
p57464
aVBe his own carver and cut out his way
p57465
aVTo find out right with wrong it may not be
p57466
aVAnd you that do abet him in this kind
p57467
aVCherish rebellion and are rebels all
p57468
aVThe noble duke hath sworn his coming is
p57469
aVBut for his own and for the right of that
p57470
aVWe all have strongly sworn to give him aid
p57471
aVAnd let him never see joy that breaks that oath
p57472
aVWell well I see the issue of these arms
p57473
aVI cannot mend it I must needs confess
p57474
aVBecause my power is weak and all ill-left
p57475
aVBut if I could by Him that gave me life
p57476
aVI would attach you all and make you stoop
p57477
aVUnto the sovereign mercy of the King
p57478
aVBut since I cannot be it known unto you
p57479
aVI do remain as neuter So fare you well
p57480
aVUnless you please to enter in the castle
p57481
aVAnd there repose you for this night
p57482
aVAn offer uncle that we will accept
p57483
aVBut we must win your Grace to go with us
p57484
aVTo Bristow Castle which they say is held
p57485
aVBy Bushy Bagot and their complices
p57486
aVThe caterpillars of the commonwealth
p57487
aVWhich I have sworn to weed and pluck away
p57488
aVIt may be I will go with you but yet I\u2019ll pause
p57489
aVFor I am loath to break our country\u2019s laws
p57490
aVNor friends nor foes to me welcome you are
p57491
aVThings past redress are now with me past care
p57492
aVMy Lord of Salisbury we have stayed ten days
p57493
aVAnd hardly kept our countrymen together
p57494
aVAnd yet we hear no tidings from the King
p57495
aVTherefore we will disperse ourselves Farewell
p57496
aVStay yet another day thou trusty Welshman
p57497
aVThe King reposeth all his confidence in thee
p57498
aV\u2019Tis thought the King is dead We will not stay
p57499
aVThe bay trees in our country are all withered
p57500
aVAnd meteors fright the fixèd stars of heaven
p57501
aVThe pale-faced moon looks bloody on the Earth
p57502
aVAnd lean-looked prophets whisper fearful change
p57503
aVRich men look sad and ruffians dance and leap
p57504
aVThe one in fear to lose what they enjoy
p57505
aVThe other to enjoy by rage and war
p57506
aVThese signs forerun the death or fall of kings
p57507
aVFarewell Our countrymen are gone and fled
p57508
aVAs well assured Richard their king is dead
p57509
aVAh Richard With the eyes of heavy mind
p57510
aVI see thy glory like a shooting star
p57511
aVFall to the base earth from the firmament
p57512
aVThy sun sets weeping in the lowly west
p57513
aVWitnessing storms to come woe and unrest
p57514
aVThy friends are fled to wait upon thy foes
p57515
aVAnd crossly to thy good all fortune goes
p57516
aVBring forth these men
p57517
aVBushy and Green I will not vex your souls
p57518
aVSince presently your souls must part your bodies
p57519

aVAnd stained the beauty of a fair queen\u2019s cheeks
p57530
aVWith tears drawn from her eyes by your foul wrongs

aVMyself a prince by fortune of my birth

aVHave stooped my neck under your injuries
p57535
aVAnd sighed my English breath in foreign clouds
p57536
aVEating the bitter bread of banishment
p57537
aVWhilst you have fed upon my seigniories
p57538
aVDisparked my parks and felled my forest woods

aVCondemns you to the death See them delivered over
p57545
aVTo execution and the hand of death
p57546
aVMore welcome is the stroke of death to me

aVTo stand upon my kingdom once again
p57565
aVDear earth I do salute thee with my hand
p57566
aVThough rebels wound thee with their horses\u2019 hoofs

aVAnd heavy-gaited toads lie in their way
p57575
aVDoing annoyance to the treacherous feet
p57576
aVWhich with usurping steps do trample thee
p57577
aVYield stinging nettles to mine enemies
p57578
aVAnd when they from thy bosom pluck a flower
p57579
aVGuard it I pray thee with a lurking adder
p57580
aVWhose double tongue may with a mortal touch

aVAnd we will not heaven\u2019s offer we refuse
p57591
aVThe proffered means of succor and redress
p57592
aVHe means my lord that we are too remiss
p57593
aVWhilst Bolingbroke through our security
p57594
aVGrows strong and great in substance and in power
p57595
aVDiscomfortable cousin know\u2019st thou not
p57596
aVThat when the searching eye of heaven is hid
p57597
aVBehind the globe that lights the lower world
p57598
aVThen thieves and robbers range abroad unseen
p57599
aVIn murders and in outrage boldly here
p57600
aVBut when from under this terrestrial ball
p57601
aVHe fires the proud tops of the eastern pines
p57602
aVAnd darts his light through every guilty hole
p57603
aVThen murders treasons and detested sins
p57604
aVThe cloak of night being plucked from off their backs
p57605
aVStand bare and naked trembling at themselves
p57606
aVSo when this thief this traitor Bolingbroke
p57607
aVWho all this while hath reveled in the night
p57608
aVWhilst we were wand\u2019ring with the Antipodes
p57609
aVShall see us rising in our throne the east
p57610
aVHis treasons will sit blushing in his face
p57611
aVNot able to endure the sight of day
p57612
aVBut self-affrighted tremble at his sin
p57613
aVNot all the water in the rough rude sea
p57614
aVCan wash the balm off from an anointed king
p57615
aVThe breath of worldly men cannot depose
p57616
aVThe deputy elected by the Lord
p57617
aVFor every man that Bolingbroke hath pressed
p57618
aVTo lift shrewd steel against our golden crown
p57619
aVGod for His Richard hath in heavenly pay
p57620
aVA glorious angel Then if angels fight

aVAnd what loss is it to be rid of care
p57656
aVStrives Bolingbroke to be as great as we

aVGreater he shall not be If he serve God
p57658
aVWe\u2019ll serve Him too and be his fellow so

p57663
aVGlad am I that your Highness is so armed
p57664
aVTo bear the tidings of calamity
p57665
aVLike an unseasonable stormy day
p57666
aVWhich makes the silver rivers drown their shores
p57667
aVAs if the world were all dissolved to tears
p57668
aVSo high above his limits swells the rage
p57669
aVOf Bolingbroke covering your fearful land
p57670
aVWith hard bright steel and hearts harder than steel
p57671
aVWhitebeards have armed their thin and hairless scalps
p57672
aVAgainst thy Majesty boys with women\u2019s voices
p57673
aVStrive to speak big and clap their female joints
p57674
aVIn stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown
p57675
aVThy very beadsmen learn to bend their bows
p57676
aVOf double-fatal yew against thy state
p57677
aVYea distaff women manage rusty bills
p57678
aVAgainst thy seat Both young and old rebel

aVWhere is the Earl of Wiltshire Where is Bagot
p57682
aVWhat is become of Bushy Where is Green
p57683
aVThat they have let the dangerous enemy
p57684
aVMeasure our confines with such peaceful steps
p57685
aVIf we prevail their heads shall pay for it
p57686
aVI warrant they have made peace with Bolingbroke

aVSnakes in my heart blood warmed that sting my heart

aVWould they make peace Terrible hell

aVAnd yet not so for what can we bequeath
p57709
aVSave our deposèd bodies to the ground
p57710
aVOur lands our lives and all are Bolingbroke\u2019s
p57711
aVAnd nothing can we call our own but death
p57712
aVAnd that small model of the barren earth
p57713
aVWhich serves as paste and cover to our bones
p57714
aVFor God\u2019s sake let us sit upon the ground
p57715
aVAnd tell sad stories of the death of kings
p57716
aVHow some have been deposed some slain in war
p57717
aVSome haunted by the ghosts they have deposed
p57718
aVSome poisoned by their wives some sleeping killed
p57719
aVAll murdered For within the hollow crown
p57720
aVThat rounds the mortal temples of a king
p57721
aVKeeps Death his court and there the antic sits
p57722
aVScoffing his state and grinning at his pomp
p57723
aVAllowing him a breath a little scene
p57724
aVTo monarchize be feared and kill with looks
p57725
aVInfusing him with self and vain conceit
p57726
aVAs if this flesh which walls about our life
p57727
aVWere brass impregnable and humored thus
p57728
aVComes at the last and with a little pin
p57729
aVBores through his castle wall and farewell king
p57730
aVCover your heads and mock not flesh and blood
p57731
aVWith solemn reverence Throw away respect
p57732
aVTradition form and ceremonious duty

aVFor you have but mistook me all this while

aVI live with bread like you feel want
p57735
aVTaste grief need friends Subjected thus
p57736
aVHow can you say to me I am a king
p57737
aVMy lord wise men ne\u2019er sit and wail their woes
p57738
aVBut presently prevent the ways to wail
p57739
aVTo fear the foe since fear oppresseth strength
p57740
aVGives in your weakness strength unto your foe
p57741
aVAnd so your follies fight against yourself
p57742
aVFear and be slain no worse can come to fight
p57743
aVAnd fight and die is death destroying death
p57744
aVWhere fearing dying pays death servile breath
p57745
aVMy father hath a power Inquire of him
p57746
aVAnd learn to make a body of a limb
p57747
aVThou chid\u2019st me well Proud Bolingbroke I come
p57748
aVTo change blows with thee for our day of doom
p57749
aVThis ague fit of fear is overblown
p57750
aVAn easy task it is to win our own
p57751
aVSay Scroop where lies our uncle with his power
p57752
aVSpeak sweetly man although thy looks be sour
p57753
aVMen judge by the complexion of the sky
p57754
aVThe state and inclination of the day
p57755
aVSo may you by my dull and heavy eye
p57756
aVMy tongue hath but a heavier tale to say
p57757
aVI play the torturer by small and small
p57758
aVTo lengthen out the worst that must be spoken
p57759
aVYour uncle York is joined with Bolingbroke
p57760
aVAnd all your northern castles yielded up
p57761
aVAnd all your southern gentlemen in arms
p57762
aVUpon his party
p57763
aVThou hast said enough
p57764
aVTo Aumerle Beshrew thee cousin which didst lead me forth
p57765
aVOf that sweet way I was in to despair
p57766
aVWhat say you now What comfort have we now
p57767
aVBy heaven I\u2019ll hate him everlastingly
p57768
aVThat bids me be of comfort anymore
p57769
aVGo to Flint Castle There I\u2019ll pine away
p57770
aVA king woe\u2019s slave shall kingly woe obey
p57771
aVThat power I have discharge and let them go
p57772
aVTo ear the land that hath some hope to grow

aVFor I have none Let no man speak again
p57774
aVTo alter this for counsel is but vain
p57775
aVMy liege one word

aVThat wounds me with the flatteries of his tongue
p57778
aVDischarge my followers Let them hence away
p57779
aVFrom Richard\u2019s night to Bolingbroke\u2019s fair day
p57780
aVSo that by this intelligence we learn
p57781
aVThe Welshmen are dispersed and Salisbury
p57782
aVIs gone to meet the King who lately landed
p57783
aVWith some few private friends upon this coast
p57784
aVThe news is very fair and good my lord
p57785
aVRichard not far from hence hath hid his head
p57786
aVIt would beseem the Lord Northumberland
p57787
aVTo say King Richard Alack the heavy day
p57788
aVWhen such a sacred king should hide his head
p57789
aVYour Grace mistakes only to be brief
p57790
aVLeft I his title out
p57791
aVThe time hath been would you have been so brief with him
p57792
aVHe would have been so brief to shorten you
p57793
aVFor taking so the head your whole head\u2019s length
p57794
aVMistake not uncle further than you should
p57795
aVTake not good cousin further than you should
p57796
aVLest you mistake The heavens are over our heads
p57797
aVI know it uncle and oppose not myself
p57798
aVAgainst their will But who comes here
p57799
aVWelcome Harry What will not this castle yield
p57800
aVThe castle royally is manned my lord
p57801
aVAgainst thy entrance
p57802
aVRoyally Why it contains no king
p57803
aVYes my good lord
p57804
aVIt doth contain a king King Richard lies
p57805
aVWithin the limits of yon lime and stone
p57806
aVAnd with him are the Lord Aumerle Lord Salisbury
p57807
aVSir Stephen Scroop besides a clergyman

aVOf holy reverence who I cannot learn

aVInto his ruined ears and thus deliver
p57814
aVHenry Bolingbroke
p57815

p57816
aVAnd sends allegiance and true faith of heart

aVEven at his feet to lay my arms and power
p57819
aVProvided that my banishment repealed
p57820
aVAnd lands restored again be freely granted
p57821
aVIf not I\u2019ll use the advantage of my power
p57822
aVAnd lay the summer\u2019s dust with showers of blood
p57823
aVRained from the wounds of slaughtered Englishmen
p57824
aVThe which how far off from the mind of Bolingbroke
p57825
aVIt is such crimson tempest should bedrench
p57826
aVThe fresh green lap of fair King Richard\u2019s land
p57827
aVMy stooping duty tenderly shall show

aVGo signify as much while here we march

aVUpon the grassy carpet of this plain

aVLet\u2019s march without the noise of threat\u2019ning drum
p57831
aVThat from this castle\u2019s tottered battlements
p57832
aVOur fair appointments may be well perused
p57833
aVMethinks King Richard and myself should meet
p57834
aVWith no less terror than the elements
p57835
aVOf fire and water when their thund\u2019ring shock
p57836
aVAt meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven
p57837
aVBe he the fire I\u2019ll be the yielding water
p57838
aVThe rage be his whilst on the earth I rain
p57839
aVMy waters on the earth and not on him
p57840
aVMarch on and mark King Richard how he looks
p57841
aVSee see King Richard doth himself appear
p57842
aVAs doth the blushing discontented sun
p57843
aVFrom out the fiery portal of the east
p57844
aVWhen he perceives the envious clouds are bent
p57845
aVTo dim his glory and to stain the track
p57846
aVOf his bright passage to the occident
p57847
aVYet looks he like a king Behold his eye
p57848
aVAs bright as is the eagle\u2019s lightens forth
p57849
aVControlling majesty Alack alack for woe
p57850
aVThat any harm should stain so fair a show
p57851
aVWe are amazed and thus long have we stood
p57852
aVTo watch the fearful bending of thy knee
p57853
aVBecause we thought ourself thy lawful king
p57854
aVAn if we be how dare thy joints forget
p57855
aVTo pay their awful duty to our presence
p57856
aVIf we be not show us the hand of God
p57857
aVThat hath dismissed us from our stewardship
p57858
aVFor well we know no hand of blood and bone
p57859
aVCan gripe the sacred handle of our scepter
p57860
aVUnless he do profane steal or usurp
p57861
aVAnd though you think that all as you have done
p57862
aVHave torn their souls by turning them from us
p57863
aVAnd we are barren and bereft of friends
p57864
aVYet know my master God omnipotent
p57865
aVIs mustering in his clouds on our behalf
p57866
aVArmies of pestilence and they shall strike
p57867
aVYour children yet unborn and unbegot
p57868
aVThat lift your vassal hands against my head
p57869
aVAnd threat the glory of my precious crown
p57870
aVTell Bolingbroke for yon methinks he stands
p57871
aVThat every stride he makes upon my land
p57872
aVIs dangerous treason He is come to open
p57873
aVThe purple testament of bleeding war
p57874
aVBut ere the crown he looks for live in peace
p57875
aVTen thousand bloody crowns of mothers\u2019 sons
p57876
aVShall ill become the flower of England\u2019s face
p57877
aVChange the complexion of her maid-pale peace
p57878
aVTo scarlet indignation and bedew
p57879
aVHer pastures\u2019 grass with faithful English blood
p57880
aVThe King of heaven forbid our lord the King

aVThat stands upon your royal grandsire\u2019s bones
p57886
aVAnd by the royalties of both your bloods
p57887
aVCurrents that spring from one most gracious head

aVAnd by the worth and honor of himself
p57890
aVComprising all that may be sworn or said
p57891
aVHis coming hither hath no further scope
p57892
aVThan for his lineal royalties and to beg
p57893
aVEnfranchisement immediate on his knees
p57894
aVWhich on thy royal party granted once

aVMy crown I am but still my griefs are mine

aVPart of your cares you give me with your crown
p58299
aVYour cares set up do not pluck my cares down
p58300
aVMy care is loss of care by old care done

aVIf thy offenses were upon record
p58336
aVWould it not shame thee in so fair a troop
p58337
aVTo read a lecture of them If thou wouldst
p58338
aVThere shouldst thou find one heinous article
p58339
aVContaining the deposing of a king
p58340
aVAnd cracking the strong warrant of an oath
p58341
aVMarked with a blot damned in the book of heaven
p58342
aVNay all of you that stand and look upon me
p58343
aVWhilst that my wretchedness doth bait myself
p58344
aVThough some of you with Pilate wash your hands
p58345
aVShowing an outward pity yet you Pilates

aVHave here delivered me to my sour cross

aVAnd water cannot wash away your sin

aVMy lord dispatch Read o\u2019er these articles
p58349
aVMine eyes are full of tears I cannot see
p58350
aVAnd yet salt water blinds them not so much

aVBut they can see a sort of traitors here
p58352
aVNay if I turn mine eyes upon myself
p58353
aVI find myself a traitor with the rest
p58354
aVFor I have given here my soul\u2019s consent

aVNor no man\u2019s lord I have no name no title
p58361
aVNo not that name was given me at the font
p58362
aVBut \u2019tis usurped Alack the heavy day
p58363
aVThat I have worn so many winters out
p58364
aVAnd know not now what name to call myself
p58365
aVO that I were a mockery king of snow
p58366
aVStanding before the sun of Bolingbroke
p58367
aVTo melt myself away in water drops
p58368
aVGood king great king and yet not greatly good
p58369
aVAn if my word be sterling yet in England
p58370
aVLet it command a mirror hither straight
p58371
aVThat it may show me what a face I have
p58372
aVSince it is bankrupt of his majesty
p58373
aVGo some of you and fetch a looking-glass
p58374
aVRead o\u2019er this paper while the glass doth come

aVFiend thou torments me ere I come to hell

aVWhen I do see the very book indeed
p58380
aVWhere all my sins are writ and that\u2019s myself
p58381
aVGive me that glass and therein will I read
p58382
aVNo deeper wrinkles yet Hath sorrow struck
p58383
aVSo many blows upon this face of mine
p58384
aVAnd made no deeper wounds O flatt\u2019ring glass
p58385
aVLike to my followers in prosperity
p58386
aVThou dost beguile me Was this face the face
p58387
aVThat every day under his household roof
p58388
aVDid keep ten thousand men Was this the face
p58389
aVThat like the sun did make beholders wink
p58390
aVIs this the face which faced so many follies
p58391
aVThat was at last outfaced by Bolingbroke
p58392
aVA brittle glory shineth in this face
p58393
aVAs brittle as the glory is the face
p58394
aVFor there it is cracked in an hundred shivers
p58395
aVMark silent king the moral of this sport
p58396
aVHow soon my sorrow hath destroyed my face
p58397
aVThe shadow of your sorrow hath destroyed
p58398
aVThe shadow of your face
p58399
aVSay that again
p58400
aVThe shadow of my sorrow Ha let\u2019s see
p58401
aV\u2019Tis very true My grief lies all within
p58402
aVAnd these external manners of laments
p58403
aVAre merely shadows to the unseen grief
p58404
aVThat swells with silence in the tortured soul
p58405
aVThere lies the substance And I thank thee king
p58406
aVFor thy great bounty that not only giv\u2019st
p58407
aVMe cause to wail but teachest me the way
p58408
aVHow to lament the cause I\u2019ll beg one boon
p58409
aVAnd then be gone and trouble you no more
p58410
aVShall I obtain it
p58411
aVName it fair cousin
p58412
aVFair cousin I am greater than a king
p58413
aVFor when I was a king my flatterers

aVWere then but subjects Being now a subject
p58415
aVI have a king here to my flatterer
p58416
aVBeing so great I have no need to beg

p58431
aVYou holy clergymen is there no plot
p58432
aVTo rid the realm of this pernicious blot
p58433
aVMy lord
p58434
aVBefore I freely speak my mind herein
p58435
aVYou shall not only take the sacrament
p58436
aVTo bury mine intents but also to effect
p58437
aVWhatever I shall happen to devise

aVTo Julius Caesar\u2019s ill-erected tower
p58444
aVTo whose flint bosom my condemnèd lord
p58445
aVIs doomed a prisoner by proud Bolingbroke
p58446
aVHere let us rest if this rebellious earth

aVBut soft but see or rather do not see

aVMy fair rose wither yet look up behold
p58450
aVThat you in pity may dissolve to dew
p58451
aVAnd wash him fresh again with true-love tears

p58453
aVThou map of honor thou King Richard\u2019s tomb
p58454
aVAnd not King Richard Thou most beauteous inn
p58455
aVWhy should hard-favored grief be lodged in thee
p58456
aVWhen triumph is become an alehouse guest
p58457
aVJoin not with grief fair woman do not so
p58458
aVTo make my end too sudden Learn good soul
p58459
aVTo think our former state a happy dream
p58460
aVFrom which awaked the truth of what we are
p58461
aVShows us but this I am sworn brother sweet
p58462
aVTo grim necessity and he and I
p58463
aVWill keep a league till death Hie thee to France
p58464
aVAnd cloister thee in some religious house
p58465
aVOur holy lives must win a new world\u2019s crown
p58466
aVWhich our profane hours here have thrown down
p58467
aVWhat is my Richard both in shape and mind
p58468
aVTransformed and weakened Hath Bolingbroke
p58469
aVDeposed thine intellect Hath he been in thy heart
p58470
aVThe lion dying thrusteth forth his paw
p58471
aVAnd wounds the earth if nothing else with rage
p58472
aVTo be o\u2019er-powered and wilt thou pupil-like
p58473
aVTake the correction mildly kiss the rod
p58474
aVAnd fawn on rage with base humility
p58475
aVWhich art a lion and the king of beasts
p58476
aVA king of beasts indeed If aught but beasts
p58477
aVI had been still a happy king of men
p58478
aVGood sometime queen prepare thee hence for France
p58479
aVThink I am dead and that even here thou takest
p58480
aVAs from my deathbed thy last living leave
p58481
aVIn winter\u2019s tedious nights sit by the fire
p58482
aVWith good old folks and let them tell thee tales
p58483
aVOf woeful ages long ago betid
p58484
aVAnd ere thou bid good night to quite their griefs
p58485
aVTell thou the lamentable tale of me
p58486
aVAnd send the hearers weeping to their beds
p58487
aVForwhy the senseless brands will sympathize
p58488
aVThe heavy accent of thy moving tongue
p58489
aVAnd in compassion weep the fire out
p58490
aVAnd some will mourn in ashes some coal-black
p58491
aVFor the deposing of a rightful king
p58492
aVMy lord the mind of Bolingbroke is changed
p58493
aVYou must to Pomfret not unto the Tower
p58494
aVAnd madam there is order ta\u2019en for you
p58495
aVWith all swift speed you must away to France
p58496
aVNorthumberland thou ladder wherewithal
p58497
aVThe mounting Bolingbroke ascends my throne
p58498
aVThe time shall not be many hours of age
p58499
aVMore than it is ere foul sin gathering head
p58500
aVShall break into corruption Thou shalt think
p58501
aVThough he divide the realm and give thee half
p58502
aVIt is too little helping him to all
p58503
aVHe shall think that thou which knowest the way
p58504
aVTo plant unrightful kings wilt know again
p58505
aVBeing ne\u2019er so little urged another way
p58506
aVTo pluck him headlong from the usurped throne
p58507
aVThe love of wicked men converts to fear
p58508
aVThat fear to hate and hate turns one or both
p58509
aVTo worthy danger and deservèd death
p58510
aVMy guilt be on my head and there an end
p58511
aVTake leave and part for you must part forthwith
p58512
aVDoubly divorced Bad men you violate
p58513
aVA twofold marriage twixt my crown and me
p58514
aVAnd then betwixt me and my married wife
p58515
aVTo Queen Let me unkiss the oath twixt thee and me
p58516
aVAnd yet not so for with a kiss \u2019twas made
p58517
aVPart us Northumberland I towards the north
p58518
aVWhere shivering cold and sickness pines the clime
p58519
aVMy wife to France from whence set forth in pomp
p58520
aVShe came adornèd hither like sweet May
p58521
aVSent back like Hallowmas or short\u2019st of day
p58522
aVAnd must we be divided Must we part
p58523
aVAy hand from hand my love and heart from heart
p58524
aVBanish us both and send the King with me
p58525
aVThat were some love but little policy
p58526
aVThen whither he goes thither let me go
p58527
aVSo two together weeping make one woe
p58528
aVWeep thou for me in France I for thee here
p58529
aVBetter far off than near be ne\u2019er the near
p58530
aVGo count thy way with sighs I mine with groans
p58531
aVSo longest way shall have the longest moans
p58532
aVTwice for one step I\u2019ll groan the way being short
p58533
aVAnd piece the way out with a heavy heart
p58534
aVCome come in wooing sorrow let\u2019s be brief
p58535
aVSince wedding it there is such length in grief
p58536
aVOne kiss shall stop our mouths and dumbly part
p58537
aVThus give I mine and thus take I thy heart
p58538
aVGive me mine own again \u2019Twere no good part
p58539
aVTo take on me to keep and kill thy heart
p58540
aVSo now I have mine own again begone
p58541
aVThat I may strive to kill it with a groan
p58542
aVWe make woe wanton with this fond delay
p58543
aVOnce more adieu The rest let sorrow say
p58544
aVMy lord you told me you would tell the rest
p58545
aVWhen weeping made you break the story off
p58546
aVOf our two cousins coming into London
p58547
aVWhere did I leave
p58548
aVAt that sad stop my lord
p58549
aVWhere rude misgoverned hands from windows\u2019 tops
p58550
aVThrew dust and rubbish on King Richard\u2019s head
p58551
aVThen as I said the Duke great Bolingbroke
p58552
aVMounted upon a hot and fiery steed
p58553
aVWhich his aspiring rider seemed to know
p58554
aVWith slow but stately pace kept on his course
p58555
aVWhilst all tongues cried God save thee Bolingbroke
p58556
aVYou would have thought the very windows spake
p58557
aVSo many greedy looks of young and old
p58558
aVThrough casements darted their desiring eyes
p58559
aVUpon his visage and that all the walls
p58560
aVWith painted imagery had said at once
p58561
aVJesu preserve thee Welcome Bolingbroke
p58562
aVWhilst he from the one side to the other turning
p58563
aVBareheaded lower than his proud steed\u2019s neck
p58564
aVBespake them thus I thank you countrymen
p58565
aVAnd thus still doing thus he passed along
p58566
aVAlack poor Richard Where rode he the whilst
p58567
aVAs in a theater the eyes of men
p58568
aVAfter a well-graced actor leaves the stage
p58569
aVAre idly bent on him that enters next
p58570
aVThinking his prattle to be tedious
p58571
aVEven so or with much more contempt men\u2019s eyes
p58572
aVDid scowl on gentle Richard No man cried God save him
p58573
aVNo joyful tongue gave him his welcome home
p58574
aVBut dust was thrown upon his sacred head
p58575
aVWhich with such gentle sorrow he shook off
p58576
aVHis face still combating with tears and smiles
p58577
aVThe badges of his grief and patience
p58578
aVThat had not God for some strong purpose steeled
p58579
aVThe hearts of men they must perforce have melted
p58580
aVAnd barbarism itself have pitied him
p58581
aVBut heaven hath a hand in these events
p58582
aVTo whose high will we bound our calm contents
p58583
aVTo Bolingbroke are we sworn subjects now
p58584
aVWhose state and honor I for aye allow
p58585
aVHere comes my son Aumerle
p58586

p58687
aVAnd wear it as a favor and with that

aVHave I no friend will rid me of this living fear
p58821
aVWas it not so
p58822
aVThese were his very words
p58823
aVHave I no friend quoth he He spake it twice
p58824
aVAnd urged it twice together did he not
p58825
aVHe did
p58826
aVAnd speaking it he wishtly looked on me
p58827
aVAs who should say I would thou wert the man
p58828
aVThat would divorce this terror from my heart
p58829
aVMeaning the king at Pomfret Come let\u2019s go
p58830
aVI am the King\u2019s friend and will rid his foe
p58831
aVI have been studying how I may compare
p58832
aVThis prison where I live unto the world
p58833
aVAnd for because the world is populous
p58834
aVAnd here is not a creature but myself
p58835
aVI cannot do it Yet I\u2019ll hammer it out
p58836
aVMy brain I\u2019ll prove the female to my soul
p58837
aVMy soul the father and these two beget
p58838
aVA generation of still-breeding thoughts
p58839
aVAnd these same thoughts people this little world
p58840
aVIn humors like the people of this world
p58841
aVFor no thought is contented The better sort
p58842
aVAs thoughts of things divine are intermixed
p58843
aVWith scruples and do set the word itself
p58844
aVAgainst the word as thus Come little ones
p58845
aVAnd then again
p58846
aVIt is as hard to come as for a camel
p58847
aVTo thread the postern of a small needle\u2019s eye
p58848
aVThoughts tending to ambition they do plot
p58849
aVUnlikely wonders how these vain weak nails
p58850
aVMay tear a passage through the flinty ribs
p58851
aVOf this hard world my ragged prison walls
p58852
aVAnd for they cannot die in their own pride
p58853
aVThoughts tending to content flatter themselves
p58854
aVThat they are not the first of fortune\u2019s slaves
p58855
aVNor shall not be the last like silly beggars
p58856
aVWho sitting in the stocks refuge their shame
p58857
aVThat many have and others must sit there
p58858
aVAnd in this thought they find a kind of ease
p58859
aVBearing their own misfortunes on the back
p58860
aVOf such as have before endured the like
p58861
aVThus play I in one person many people
p58862
aVAnd none contented Sometimes am I king
p58863
aVThen treasons make me wish myself a beggar
p58864
aVAnd so I am then crushing penury
p58865
aVPersuades me I was better when a king
p58866
aVThen am I kinged again and by and by
p58867
aVThink that I am unkinged by Bolingbroke
p58868
aVAnd straight am nothing But whate\u2019er I be
p58869
aVNor I nor any man that but man is
p58870
aVWith nothing shall be pleased till he be eased
p58871
aVWith being nothing The music plays Music do I hear
p58872
aVHa ha keep time How sour sweet music is
p58873
aVWhen time is broke and no proportion kept
p58874
aVSo is it in the music of men\u2019s lives
p58875
aVAnd here have I the daintiness of ear
p58876
aVTo check time broke in a disordered string
p58877
aVBut for the concord of my state and time
p58878
aVHad not an ear to hear my true time broke
p58879
aVI wasted time and now doth time waste me
p58880
aVFor now hath time made me his numb\u2019ring clock
p58881
aVMy thoughts are minutes and with sighs they jar
p58882
aVTheir watches on unto mine eyes the outward watch
p58883
aVWhereto my finger like a dial\u2019s point
p58884
aVIs pointing still in cleansing them from tears
p58885
aVNow sir the sound that tells what hour it is
p58886
aVAre clamorous groans which strike upon my heart
p58887
aVWhich is the bell So sighs and tears and groans
p58888
aVShow minutes times and hours But my time
p58889
aVRuns posting on in Bolingbroke\u2019s proud joy
p58890
aVWhile I stand fooling here his jack of the clock
p58891
aVThis music mads me Let it sound no more
p58892
aVFor though it have holp madmen to their wits
p58893
aVIn me it seems it will make wise men mad
p58894
aVYet blessing on his heart that gives it me
p58895
aVFor \u2019tis a sign of love and love to Richard
p58896
aVIs a strange brooch in this all-hating world
p58897
aVHail royal prince
p58898
aVThanks noble peer
p58899
aVThe cheapest of us is ten groats too dear
p58900
aVWhat art thou and how comest thou hither
p58901
aVWhere no man never comes but that sad dog
p58902
aVThat brings me food to make misfortune live
p58903
aVI was a poor groom of thy stable king
p58904
aVWhen thou wert king who traveling towards York
p58905
aVWith much ado at length have gotten leave
p58906
aVTo look upon my sometime royal master\u2019s face
p58907
aVO how it earned my heart when I beheld
p58908
aVIn London streets that coronation day
p58909
aVWhen Bolingbroke rode on roan Barbary
p58910
aVThat horse that thou so often hast bestrid
p58911
aVThat horse that I so carefully have dressed
p58912
aVRode he on Barbary Tell me gentle friend
p58913
aVHow went he under him
p58914
aVSo proudly as if he disdained the ground
p58915
aVSo proud that Bolingbroke was on his back
p58916
aVThat jade hath eat bread from my royal hand
p58917
aVThis hand hath made him proud with clapping him
p58918
aVWould he not stumble Would he not fall down
p58919
aVSince pride must have a fall and break the neck
p58920
aVOf that proud man that did usurp his back
p58921
aVForgiveness horse Why do I rail on thee
p58922
aVSince thou created to be awed by man
p58923
aVWast born to bear I was not made a horse
p58924
aVAnd yet I bear a burden like an ass
p58925
aVSpurred galled and tired by jauncing Bolingbroke
p58926
aVFellow give place Here is no longer stay
p58927
aVIf thou love me \u2019tis time thou wert away
p58928
aVWhat my tongue dares not that my heart shall say
p58929
aVMy lord will \u2019t please you to fall to
p58930
aVTaste of it first as thou art wont to do
p58931
aVMy lord I dare not Sir Pierce of Exton

aVPatience is stale and I am weary of it
p58935
aVHelp help help
p58936
aVHow now what means death in this rude assault
p58937
aVVillain thy own hand yields thy death\u2019s instrument
p58938
aVGo thou and fill another room in hell

p58944
aVAs full of valor as of royal blood

aVFor now the devil that told me I did well

aVThe next news is I have to London sent

aVWe thank thee gentle Percy for thy pains
p58961
aVAnd to thy worth will add right worthy gains
p58962
aVMy lord I have from Oxford sent to London
p58963
aVThe heads of Brocas and Sir Bennet Seely
p58964
aVTwo of the dangerous consorted traitors
p58965
aVThat sought at Oxford thy dire overthrow
p58966
aVThy pains Fitzwater shall not be forgot
p58967
aVRight noble is thy merit well I wot
p58968
aVThe grand conspirator Abbot of Westminster
p58969
aVWith clog of conscience and sour melancholy

aVBut here is Carlisle living to abide

aVSo as thou liv\u2019st in peace die free from strife
p58977
aVFor though mine enemy thou hast ever been
p58978
aVHigh sparks of honor in thee have I seen
p58979
aVGreat king within this coffin I present
p58980
aVThy buried fear Herein all breathless lies
p58981
aVThe mightiest of thy greatest enemies
p58982
aVRichard of Bourdeaux by me hither brought
p58983
aVExton I thank thee not for thou hast wrought
p58984
aVA deed of slander with thy fatal hand
p58985
aVUpon my head and all this famous land
p58986
aVFrom your own mouth my lord did I this deed
p58987
aVThey love not poison that do poison need

aVNor do I thee Though I did wish him dead
p58989
aVI hate the murderer love him murderèd
p58990
aVThe guilt of conscience take thou for thy labor
p58991
aVBut neither my good word nor princely favor
p58992
aVWith Cain go wander through shades of night
p58993
aVAnd never show thy head by day nor light
p58994
aVLords I protest my soul is full of woe
p58995
aVThat blood should sprinkle me to make me grow
p58996
aVCome mourn with me for what I do lament
p58997
aVAnd put on sullen black incontinent
p58998
aVI\u2019ll make a voyage to the Holy Land
p58999
aVTo wash this blood off from my guilty hand
p59000
aVMarch sadly after Grace my mournings here
p59001
aVIn weeping after this untimely bier
p59002
aVNow is the winter of our discontent
p59003
aVMade glorious summer by this son of York
p59004
aVAnd all the clouds that loured upon our house
p59005
aVIn the deep bosom of the ocean buried
p59006
aVNow are our brows bound with victorious wreaths
p59007
aVOur bruisèd arms hung up for monuments
p59008
aVOur stern alarums changed to merry meetings
p59009
aVOur dreadful marches to delightful measures
p59010
aVGrim-visaged war hath smoothed his wrinkled front
p59011
aVAnd now instead of mounting barbèd steeds
p59012
aVTo fright the souls of fearful adversaries
p59013
aVHe capers nimbly in a lady\u2019s chamber
p59014
aVTo the lascivious pleasing of a lute
p59015
aVBut I that am not shaped for sportive tricks
p59016
aVNor made to court an amorous looking glass
p59017
aVI that am rudely stamped and want love\u2019s majesty
p59018
aVTo strut before a wanton ambling nymph
p59019
aVI that am curtailed of this fair proportion
p59020
aVCheated of feature by dissembling nature
p59021
aVDeformed unfinished sent before my time
p59022
aVInto this breathing world scarce half made up
p59023
aVAnd that so lamely and unfashionable
p59024
aVThat dogs bark at me as I halt by them
p59025
aVWhy I in this weak piping time of peace
p59026
aVHave no delight to pass away the time
p59027
aVUnless to see my shadow in the sun
p59028
aVAnd descant on mine own deformity
p59029
aVAnd therefore since I cannot prove a lover
p59030
aVTo entertain these fair well-spoken days
p59031
aVI am determinèd to prove a villain
p59032
aVAnd hate the idle pleasures of these days
p59033
aVPlots have I laid inductions dangerous
p59034
aVBy drunken prophecies libels and dreams
p59035
aVTo set my brother Clarence and the King
p59036
aVIn deadly hate the one against the other
p59037
aVAnd if King Edward be as true and just
p59038
aVAs I am subtle false and treacherous
p59039
aVThis day should Clarence closely be mewed up
p59040
aVAbout a prophecy which says that G
p59041
aVOf Edward\u2019s heirs the murderer shall be
p59042
aVDive thoughts down to my soul Here Clarence comes
p59043
aVBrother good day What means this armèd guard
p59044
aVThat waits upon your Grace
p59045
aVHis Majesty
p59046
aVTend\u2019ring my person\u2019s safety hath appointed
p59047
aVThis conduct to convey me to the Tower
p59048
aVUpon what cause
p59049
aVBecause my name is George
p59050
aVAlack my lord that fault is none of yours
p59051
aVHe should for that commit your godfathers
p59052
aVO belike his Majesty hath some intent
p59053
aVThat you should be new christened in the Tower
p59054
aVBut what\u2019s the matter Clarence May I know
p59055
aVYea Richard when I know for I protest
p59056
aVAs yet I do not But as I can learn
p59057
aVHe hearkens after prophecies and dreams
p59058
aVAnd from the crossrow plucks the letter G
p59059
aVAnd says a wizard told him that by G
p59060
aVHis issue disinherited should be
p59061
aVAnd for my name of George begins with G
p59062
aVIt follows in his thought that I am he
p59063
aVThese as I learn and such like toys as these
p59064
aVHath moved his Highness to commit me now
p59065
aVWhy this it is when men are ruled by women
p59066

aVMy Lady Grey his wife Clarence \u2019tis she

aVClarence hath not another day to live
p59153
aVWhich done God take King Edward to His mercy
p59154
aVAnd leave the world for me to bustle in

aVAnd was embarked to cross to Burgundy

aVAnd in my company my brother Gloucester
p59807
aVWho from my cabin tempted me to walk
p59808
aVUpon the hatches Thence we looked toward England

aVAnd cited up a thousand heavy times
p59810
aVDuring the wars of York and Lancaster
p59811
aVThat had befall\u2019n us As we paced along
p59812
aVUpon the giddy footing of the hatches

p59815
aVInto the tumbling billows of the main
p59816
aVO Lord methought what pain it was to drown
p59817
aVWhat dreadful noise of waters in my ears

p59820
aVA thousand men that fishes gnawed upon
p59821
aVWedges of gold great anchors heaps of pearl
p59822
aVInestimable stones unvalued jewels
p59823
aVAll scattered in the bottom of the sea
p59824
aVSome lay in dead men\u2019s skulls and in the holes
p59825
aVWhere eyes did once inhabit there were crept
p59826
aVAs \u2019twere in scorn of eyes reflecting gems
p59827
aVThat wooed the slimy bottom of the deep
p59828
aVAnd mocked the dead bones that lay scattered by
p59829
aVHad you such leisure in the time of death
p59830
aVTo gaze upon these secrets of the deep
p59831
aVMethought I had and often did I strive
p59832
aVTo yield the ghost but still the envious flood
p59833
aVStopped in my soul and would not let it forth
p59834
aVTo find the empty vast and wand\u2019ring air
p59835
aVBut smothered it within my panting bulk
p59836
aVWho almost burst to belch it in the sea
p59837
aVAwaked you not in this sore agony
p59838
aVNo no my dream was lengthened after life
p59839
aVO then began the tempest to my soul

aVI passed methought the melancholy flood
p59841
aVWith that sour ferryman which poets write of
p59842
aVUnto the kingdom of perpetual night
p59843
aVThe first that there did greet my stranger-soul
p59844
aVWas my great father-in-law renownèd Warwick
p59845
aVWho spake aloud What scourge for perjury
p59846
aVCan this dark monarchy afford false Clarence
p59847
aVAnd so he vanished Then came wand\u2019ring by
p59848
aVA shadow like an angel with bright hair
p59849
aVDabbled in blood and he shrieked out aloud
p59850
aVClarence is come false fleeting perjured Clarence
p59851
aVThat stabbed me in the field by Tewkesbury
p59852
aVSeize on him furies Take him unto torment
p59853
aVWith that methoughts a legion of foul fiends
p59854
aVEnvironed me and howlèd in mine ears
p59855
aVSuch hideous cries that with the very noise
p59856
aVI trembling waked and for a season after
p59857
aVCould not believe but that I was in hell
p59858
aVSuch terrible impression made my dream
p59859
aVNo marvel lord though it affrighted you
p59860
aVI am afraid methinks to hear you tell it
p59861
aVAh keeper keeper I have done these things
p59862
aVThat now give evidence against my soul
p59863
aVFor Edward\u2019s sake and see how he requites me
p59864
aVO God if my deep prayers cannot appease thee
p59865
aVBut thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds
p59866
aVYet execute thy wrath in me alone
p59867
aVO spare my guiltless wife and my poor children
p59868
aVKeeper I prithee sit by me awhile
p59869
aVMy soul is heavy and I fain would sleep
p59870
aVI will my lord God give your Grace good rest
p59871
aVSorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours
p59872
aVMakes the night morning and the noontide night
p59873
aVPrinces have but their titles for their glories
p59874
aVAn outward honor for an inward toil
p59875
aVAnd for unfelt imaginations
p59876
aVThey often feel a world of restless cares
p59877
aVSo that between their titles and low name
p59878
aVThere\u2019s nothing differs but the outward fame
p59879
aVHo who\u2019s here
p59880
aVWhat wouldst thou fellow And how cam\u2019st thou hither
p59881
aVWhat so brief
p59882
aVI am in this commanded to deliver
p59883
aVThe noble Duke of Clarence to your hands
p59884
aVI will not reason what is meant hereby
p59885
aVBecause I will be guiltless from the meaning
p59886
aVThere lies the Duke asleep and there the keys
p59887
aVI\u2019ll to the King and signify to him
p59888
aVThat thus I have resigned to you my charge
p59889
aVWhere art thou keeper Give me a cup of wine
p59890
aVYou shall have wine enough my lord anon
p59891
aVIn God\u2019s name what art thou
p59892
aVA man as you are
p59893
aVBut not as I am royal
p59894
aVNor you as we are loyal
p59895
aVThy voice is thunder but thy looks are humble
p59896
aVMy voice is now the King\u2019s my looks mine own
p59897
aVHow darkly and how deadly dost thou speak
p59898
aVYour eyes do menace me Why look you pale
p59899
aVWho sent you hither Wherefore do you come
p59900
aVTo to to
p59901
aVTo murder me
p59902
aVAy ay
p59903
aVYou scarcely have the hearts to tell me so

aVOffended us you have not but the King
p59907
aVI shall be reconciled to him again
p59908
aVNever my lord Therefore prepare to die
p59909
aVAre you drawn forth among a world of men
p59910
aVTo slay the innocent What is my offense
p59911
aVWhere is the evidence that doth accuse me
p59912
aVWhat lawful quest have given their verdict up
p59913
aVUnto the frowning judge Or who pronounced
p59914
aVThe bitter sentence of poor Clarence\u2019 death
p59915
aVBefore I be convict by course of law
p59916
aVTo threaten me with death is most unlawful
p59917
aVI charge you as you hope to have redemption
p59918
aVBy Christ\u2019s dear blood shed for our grievous sins
p59919
aVThat you depart and lay no hands on me
p59920
aVThe deed you undertake is damnable
p59921
aVWhat we will do we do upon command
p59922
aVAnd he that hath commanded is our king
p59923
aVErroneous vassals the great King of kings
p59924
aVHath in the table of His law commanded
p59925
aVThat thou shalt do no murder Will you then
p59926
aVSpurn at His edict and fulfill a man\u2019s
p59927
aVTake heed for He holds vengeance in His hand
p59928
aVTo hurl upon their heads that break His law
p59929
aVAnd that same vengeance doth He hurl on thee
p59930
aVFor false forswearing and for murder too
p59931
aVThou didst receive the sacrament to fight
p59932
aVIn quarrel of the House of Lancaster
p59933
aVAnd like a traitor to the name of God
p59934
aVDidst break that vow and with thy treacherous blade
p59935
aVUnrippedst the bowels of thy sovereign\u2019s son
p59936
aVWhom thou wast sworn to cherish and defend
p59937
aVHow canst thou urge God\u2019s dreadful law to us
p59938
aVWhen thou hast broke it in such dear degree
p59939
aVAlas For whose sake did I that ill deed
p59940
aVFor Edward for my brother for his sake
p59941
aVHe sends you not to murder me for this
p59942
aVFor in that sin he is as deep as I
p59943
aVIf God will be avengèd for the deed
p59944
aVO know you yet He doth it publicly
p59945
aVTake not the quarrel from His powerful arm
p59946
aVHe needs no indirect or lawless course
p59947
aVTo cut off those that have offended Him
p59948
aVWho made thee then a bloody minister
p59949
aVWhen gallant-springing brave Plantagenet
p59950
aVThat princely novice was struck dead by thee

aVMy brother\u2019s love the devil and my rage

aVIf you are hired for meed go back again
p59957
aVAnd I will send you to my brother Gloucester
p59958
aVWho shall reward you better for my life
p59959
aVThan Edward will for tidings of my death
p59960
aVYou are deceived Your brother Gloucester hates you
p59961
aVO no he loves me and he holds me dear

aVGo you to him from me

p59964
aVTell him when that our princely father York
p59965
aVBlessed his three sons with his victorious arm

aVHe little thought of this divided friendship
p59967
aVBid Gloucester think of this and he will weep
p59968
aVAy millstones as he lessoned us to weep
p59969
aVO do not slander him for he is kind
p59970
aVRight as snow in harvest Come you deceive yourself
p59971
aV\u2019Tis he that sends us to destroy you here
p59972
aVIt cannot be for he bewept my fortune
p59973
aVAnd hugged me in his arms and swore with sobs
p59974
aVThat he would labor my delivery
p59975
aVWhy so he doth when he delivers you
p59976
aVFrom this Earth\u2019s thralldom to the joys of heaven
p59977
aVMake peace with God for you must die my lord
p59978
aVHave you that holy feeling in your souls
p59979
aVTo counsel me to make my peace with God

aVThat you will war with God by murd\u2019ring me
p59982
aVO sirs consider they that set you on
p59983
aVTo do this deed will hate you for the deed
p59984

aVRelent and save your souls
p59986
aVWhich of you if you were a prince\u2019s son
p59987
aVBeing pent from liberty as I am now

aVAnd cry O Clarence my unhappy son
p60160
aVWhy do you look on us and shake your head
p60161
aVAnd call us orphans wretches castaways
p60162
aVIf that our noble father were alive
p60163
aVMy pretty cousins you mistake me both

aVI do lament the sickness of the King

aVAnd so will I
p60172
aVPeace children peace The King doth love you well

aVGrandam we can for my good uncle Gloucester
p60176
aVTold me the King provoked to it by the Queen

aVAnd when my uncle told me so he wept
p60179
aVAnd pitied me and kindly kissed my cheek
p60180
aVBade me rely on him as on my father
p60181
aVAnd he would love me dearly as a child
p60182
aVAh that deceit should steal such gentle shape
p60183
aVAnd with a virtuous visor hide deep vice
p60184
aVHe is my son ay and therein my shame

aVThink you my uncle did dissemble grandam

aVI cannot think it Hark what noise is this
p60189
aVAh who shall hinder me to wail and weep
p60190
aVTo chide my fortune and torment myself
p60191
aVI\u2019ll join with black despair against my soul
p60192
aVAnd to myself become an enemy
p60193
aVWhat means this scene of rude impatience
p60194
aVTo make an act of tragic violence
p60195
aVEdward my lord thy son our king is dead
p60196
aVWhy grow the branches when the root is gone
p60197
aVWhy wither not the leaves that want their sap

aVAs I had title in thy noble husband
p60204
aVI have bewept a worthy husband\u2019s death
p60205
aVAnd lived with looking on his images
p60206
aVBut now two mirrors of his princely semblance

p60208
aVAnd I for comfort have but one false glass

aVThat grieves me when I see my shame in him
p60210
aVThou art a widow yet thou art a mother
p60211
aVAnd hast the comfort of thy children left
p60212
aVBut death hath snatched my husband from mine arms

aVTo overgo thy woes and drown thy cries

aVMay send forth plenteous tears to drown the world
p60226
aVAh for my husband for my dear lord Edward
p60227
aVAh for our father for our dear lord Clarence
p60228
aVAlas for both both mine Edward and Clarence

aVTheir woes are parceled mine is general

aVAlas you three on me threefold distressed

aVPour all your tears I am your sorrow\u2019s nurse
p60243
aVAnd I will pamper it with lamentation
p60244
aVComfort dear mother God is much displeased
p60245
aVThat you take with unthankfulness His doing
p60246
aVIn common worldly things \u2019tis called ungrateful
p60247
aVWith dull unwillingness to repay a debt
p60248
aVWhich with a bounteous hand was kindly lent
p60249
aVMuch more to be thus opposite with heaven
p60250
aVFor it requires the royal debt it lent you
p60251
aVMadam bethink you like a careful mother
p60252
aVOf the young prince your son Send straight for him
p60253
aVLet him be crowned In him your comfort lives

aVAnd plant your joys in living Edward\u2019s throne
p60256
aVSister have comfort All of us have cause
p60257
aVTo wail the dimming of our shining star
p60258
aVBut none can help our harms by wailing them
p60259
aVMadam my mother I do cry you mercy
p60260
aVI did not see your Grace Humbly on my knee
p60261
aVI crave your blessing
p60262
aVGod bless thee and put meekness in thy breast
p60263
aVLove charity obedience and true duty
p60264
aVAmen Aside And make me die a good old man
p60265
aVThat is the butt end of a mother\u2019s blessing
p60266
aVI marvel that her Grace did leave it out
p60267
aVYou cloudy princes and heart-sorrowing peers
p60268
aVThat bear this heavy mutual load of moan
p60269
aVNow cheer each other in each other\u2019s love
p60270
aVThough we have spent our harvest of this king
p60271
aVWe are to reap the harvest of his son
p60272
aVThe broken rancor of your high-swoll\u2019n hates
p60273
aVBut lately splintered knit and joined together
p60274
aVMust gently be preserved cherished and kept
p60275
aVMeseemeth good that with some little train
p60276
aVForthwith from Ludlow the young prince be fet
p60277
aVHither to London to be crowned our king
p60278
aVWhy with some little train my lord of Buckingham
p60279
aVMarry my lord lest by a multitude
p60280
aVThe new-healed wound of malice should break out
p60281
aVWhich would be so much the more dangerous
p60282
aVBy how much the estate is green and yet ungoverned
p60283
aVWhere every horse bears his commanding rein
p60284
aVAnd may direct his course as please himself
p60285
aVAs well the fear of harm as harm apparent
p60286
aVIn my opinion ought to be prevented
p60287
aVI hope the King made peace with all of us
p60288
aVAnd the compact is firm and true in me
p60289
aVAnd so in me and so I think in all
p60290
aVYet since it is but green it should be put
p60291
aVTo no apparent likelihood of breach
p60292
aVWhich haply by much company might be urged
p60293
aVTherefore I say with noble Buckingham
p60294
aVThat it is meet so few should fetch the Prince
p60295
aVAnd so say I
p60296
aVThen be it so and go we to determine
p60297
aVWho they shall be that straight shall post to Ludlow
p60298
aVMadam and you my sister will you go
p60299
aVTo give your censures in this business
p60300
aVMy lord whoever journeys to the Prince
p60301
aVFor God\u2019s sake let not us two stay at home
p60302
aVFor by the way I\u2019ll sort occasion
p60303
aVAs index to the story we late talked of
p60304
aVTo part the Queen\u2019s proud kindred from the Prince
p60305
aVMy other self my council\u2019s consistory
p60306
aVMy oracle my prophet my dear cousin
p60307
aVI as a child will go by thy direction
p60308
aVToward Ludlow then for we\u2019ll not stay behind
p60309
aVGood morrow neighbor whither away so fast
p60310
aVI promise you I scarcely know myself
p60311
aVHear you the news abroad
p60312
aVYes that the King is dead
p60313
aVIll news by \u2019r Lady Seldom comes the better
p60314
aVI fear I fear \u2019twill prove a giddy world
p60315
aVNeighbors God speed
p60316
aVGive you good morrow sir
p60317
aVDoth the news hold of good King Edward\u2019s death
p60318
aVAy sir it is too true God help the while
p60319
aVThen masters look to see a troublous world
p60320
aVNo no by God\u2019s good grace his son shall reign
p60321
aVWoe to that land that\u2019s governed by a child
p60322
aVIn him there is a hope of government
p60323
aVWhich in his nonage council under him
p60324
aVAnd in his full and ripened years himself
p60325
aVNo doubt shall then and till then govern well
p60326
aVSo stood the state when Henry the Sixth
p60327
aVWas crowned in Paris but at nine months old
p60328
aVStood the state so No no good friends God wot
p60329
aVFor then this land was famously enriched
p60330
aVWith politic grave counsel then the King
p60331
aVHad virtuous uncles to protect his Grace
p60332
aVWhy so hath this both by his father and mother
p60333
aVBetter it were they all came by his father
p60334
aVOr by his father there were none at all
p60335
aVFor emulation who shall now be nearest
p60336
aVWill touch us all too near if God prevent not
p60337
aVO full of danger is the Duke of Gloucester
p60338
aVAnd the Queen\u2019s sons and brothers haught and proud
p60339
aVAnd were they to be ruled and not to rule
p60340
aVThis sickly land might solace as before
p60341
aVCome come we fear the worst All will be well
p60342
aVWhen clouds are seen wise men put on their cloaks
p60343
aVWhen great leaves fall then winter is at hand
p60344
aVWhen the sun sets who doth not look for night
p60345
aVUntimely storms makes men expect a dearth
p60346
aVAll may be well but if God sort it so
p60347
aV\u2019Tis more than we deserve or I expect
p60348
aVTruly the hearts of men are full of fear
p60349
aVYou cannot reason almost with a man
p60350
aVThat looks not heavily and full of dread
p60351
aVBefore the days of change still is it so
p60352
aVBy a divine instinct men\u2019s minds mistrust
p60353
aVEnsuing danger as by proof we see
p60354
aVThe water swell before a boist\u2019rous storm
p60355
aVBut leave it all to God Whither away
p60356
aVMarry we were sent for to the Justices
p60357
aVAnd so was I I\u2019ll bear you company
p60358
aVLast night I hear they lay at Stony Stratford
p60359
aVAnd at Northampton they do rest tonight
p60360
aVTomorrow or next day they will be here
p60361
aVI long with all my heart to see the Prince
p60362
aVI hope he is much grown since last I saw him
p60363
aVBut I hear no they say my son of York
p60364
aVHas almost overta\u2019en him in his growth
p60365
aVAy mother but I would not have it so
p60366
aVWhy my good cousin It is good to grow
p60367
aVGrandam one night as we did sit at supper
p60368
aVMy uncle Rivers talked how I did grow
p60369
aVMore than my brother Ay quoth my uncle Gloucester
p60370
aVSmall herbs have grace great weeds do grow apace
p60371
aVAnd since methinks I would not grow so fast
p60372
aVBecause sweet flowers are slow and weeds make haste
p60373
aVGood faith good faith the saying did not hold
p60374
aVIn him that did object the same to thee
p60375
aVHe was the wretched\u2019st thing when he was young
p60376
aVSo long a-growing and so leisurely
p60377
aVThat if his rule were true he should be gracious
p60378
aVAnd so no doubt he is my gracious madam
p60379
aVI hope he is but yet let mothers doubt
p60380
aVNow by my troth if I had been remembered
p60381
aVI could have given my uncle\u2019s Grace a flout
p60382
aVTo touch his growth nearer than he touched mine
p60383
aVHow my young York I prithee let me hear it
p60384
aVMarry they say my uncle grew so fast
p60385
aVThat he could gnaw a crust at two hours old
p60386
aV\u2019Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth
p60387
aVGrandam this would have been a biting jest
p60388
aVI prithee pretty York who told thee this
p60389
aVGrandam his nurse
p60390
aVHis nurse Why she was dead ere thou wast born
p60391
aVIf \u2019twere not she I cannot tell who told me
p60392
aVA parlous boy Go to you are too shrewd
p60393
aVGood madam be not angry with the child
p60394
aVPitchers have ears
p60395
aVHere comes a messenger What news
p60396
aVSuch news my lord as grieves me to report
p60397
aVHow doth the Prince

p60402
aVWho hath committed them

aVThe mighty dukes Gloucester and Buckingham
p60404
aVFor what offense
p60405
aVThe sum of all I can I have disclosed
p60406
aVWhy or for what the nobles were committed
p60407
aVIs all unknown to me my gracious lord
p60408
aVAy me I see the ruin of my house
p60409
aVThe tiger now hath seized the gentle hind
p60410
aVInsulting tyranny begins to jut
p60411
aVUpon the innocent and aweless throne
p60412
aVWelcome destruction blood and massacre
p60413
aVI see as in a map the end of all
p60414
aVAccursèd and unquiet wrangling days
p60415
aVHow many of you have mine eyes beheld
p60416
aVMy husband lost his life to get the crown
p60417
aVAnd often up and down my sons were tossed
p60418
aVFor me to joy and weep their gain and loss
p60419
aVAnd being seated and domestic broils
p60420
aVClean overblown themselves the conquerors
p60421
aVMake war upon themselves brother to brother
p60422
aVBlood to blood self against self O preposterous
p60423
aVAnd frantic outrage end thy damnèd spleen
p60424
aVOr let me die to look on Earth no more
p60425
aVCome come my boy We will to sanctuary

aVAs well I tender you and all of yours
p60434
aVGo I\u2019ll conduct you to the sanctuary
p60435
aVWelcome sweet prince to London to your chamber
p60436
aVWelcome dear cousin my thoughts\u2019 sovereign
p60437
aVThe weary way hath made you melancholy
p60438
aVNo uncle but our crosses on the way
p60439
aVHave made it tedious wearisome and heavy
p60440
aVI want more uncles here to welcome me
p60441
aVSweet prince the untainted virtue of your years
p60442
aVHath not yet dived into the world\u2019s deceit
p60443
aVNor more can you distinguish of a man
p60444
aVThan of his outward show which God He knows
p60445
aVSeldom or never jumpeth with the heart
p60446
aVThose uncles which you want were dangerous
p60447
aVYour Grace attended to their sugared words
p60448
aVBut looked not on the poison of their hearts
p60449
aVGod keep you from them and from such false friends
p60450
aVGod keep me from false friends but they were none
p60451
aVMy lord the Mayor of London comes to greet you
p60452
aVGod bless your Grace with health and happy days
p60453
aVI thank you good my lord and thank you all
p60454
aVI thought my mother and my brother York
p60455
aVWould long ere this have met us on the way
p60456
aVFie what a slug is Hastings that he comes not
p60457
aVTo tell us whether they will come or no
p60458
aVAnd in good time here comes the sweating lord
p60459
aVWelcome my lord What will our mother come
p60460
aVOn what occasion God He knows not I
p60461
aVThe Queen your mother and your brother York
p60462
aVHave taken sanctuary The tender prince
p60463
aVWould fain have come with me to meet your Grace
p60464
aVBut by his mother was perforce withheld
p60465
aVFie what an indirect and peevish course
p60466
aVIs this of hers Lord Cardinal will your Grace
p60467
aVPersuade the Queen to send the Duke of York
p60468
aVUnto his princely brother presently
p60469
aVIf she deny Lord Hastings go with him
p60470
aVAnd from her jealous arms pluck him perforce
p60471
aVMy lord of Buckingham if my weak oratory
p60472
aVCan from his mother win the Duke of York
p60473
aVAnon expect him here but if she be obdurate
p60474
aVTo mild entreaties God in heaven forbid
p60475
aVWe should infringe the holy privilege
p60476
aVOf blessèd sanctuary Not for all this land
p60477
aVWould I be guilty of so deep a sin
p60478
aVYou are too senseless obstinate my lord
p60479
aVToo ceremonious and traditional
p60480
aVWeigh it but with the grossness of this age
p60481
aVYou break not sanctuary in seizing him
p60482
aVThe benefit thereof is always granted
p60483
aVTo those whose dealings have deserved the place
p60484
aVAnd those who have the wit to claim the place
p60485
aVThis prince hath neither claimed it nor deserved it
p60486
aVAnd therefore in mine opinion cannot have it
p60487
aVThen taking him from thence that is not there
p60488
aVYou break no privilege nor charter there
p60489
aVOft have I heard of sanctuary men
p60490
aVBut sanctuary children never till now
p60491
aVMy lord you shall o\u2019errule my mind for once
p60492
aVCome on Lord Hastings will you go with me
p60493
aVI go my lord
p60494
aVGood lords make all the speedy haste you may
p60495
aVSay uncle Gloucester if our brother come
p60496
aVWhere shall we sojourn till our coronation
p60497
aVWhere it seems best unto your royal self
p60498
aVIf I may counsel you some day or two
p60499
aVYour Highness shall repose you at the Tower
p60500
aVThen where you please and shall be thought most fit
p60501
aVFor your best health and recreation
p60502
aVI do not like the Tower of any place
p60503
aVDid Julius Caesar build that place my lord
p60504
aVHe did my gracious lord begin that place
p60505
aVWhich since succeeding ages have re-edified
p60506
aVIs it upon record or else reported
p60507
aVSuccessively from age to age he built it
p60508
aVUpon record my gracious lord
p60509
aVBut say my lord it were not registered
p60510
aVMethinks the truth should live from age to age
p60511
aVAs \u2019twere retailed to all posterity
p60512
aVEven to the general all-ending day
p60513
aVSo wise so young they say do never live long
p60514
aVWhat say you uncle
p60515
aVI say without characters fame lives long
p60516
aVAside Thus like the formal Vice Iniquity
p60517
aVI moralize two meanings in one word
p60518
aVThat Julius Caesar was a famous man
p60519
aVWith what his valor did enrich his wit
p60520
aVHis wit set down to make his valor live
p60521
aVDeath makes no conquest of this conqueror
p60522
aVFor now he lives in fame though not in life
p60523
aVI\u2019ll tell you what my cousin Buckingham
p60524
aVWhat my gracious lord
p60525
aVAn if I live until I be a man
p60526
aVI\u2019ll win our ancient right in France again
p60527
aVOr die a soldier as I lived a king
p60528
aVShort summers lightly have a forward spring
p60529
aVNow in good time here comes the Duke of York
p60530
aVRichard of York how fares our loving brother
p60531
aVWell my dread lord so must I call you now
p60532
aVAy brother to our grief as it is yours
p60533
aVToo late he died that might have kept that title
p60534
aVWhich by his death hath lost much majesty
p60535
aVHow fares our cousin noble lord of York
p60536
aVI thank you gentle uncle O my lord
p60537
aVYou said that idle weeds are fast in growth
p60538
aVThe Prince my brother hath outgrown me far
p60539
aVHe hath my lord
p60540
aVAnd therefore is he idle
p60541
aVO my fair cousin I must not say so
p60542
aVThen he is more beholding to you than I
p60543
aVHe may command me as my sovereign
p60544
aVBut you have power in me as in a kinsman
p60545
aVI pray you uncle give me this dagger
p60546
aVMy dagger little cousin With all my heart
p60547
aVA beggar brother
p60548
aVOf my kind uncle that I know will give
p60549
aVAnd being but a toy which is no grief to give
p60550
aVA greater gift than that I\u2019ll give my cousin
p60551
aVA greater gift O that\u2019s the sword to it
p60552
aVAy gentle cousin were it light enough
p60553
aVO then I see you will part but with light gifts
p60554
aVIn weightier things you\u2019ll say a beggar nay
p60555
aVIt is too heavy for your Grace to wear
p60556
aVI weigh it lightly were it heavier
p60557
aVWhat would you have my weapon little lord
p60558
aVI would that I might thank you as you call me
p60559
aVHow
p60560
aVLittle
p60561
aVMy lord of York will still be cross in talk
p60562
aVUncle your Grace knows how to bear with him
p60563
aVYou mean to bear me not to bear with me
p60564
aVUncle my brother mocks both you and me
p60565
aVBecause that I am little like an ape
p60566
aVHe thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders
p60567
aVWith what a sharp-provided wit he reasons
p60568
aVTo mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle
p60569
aVHe prettily and aptly taunts himself
p60570
aVSo cunning and so young is wonderful
p60571
aVMy lord will \u2019t please you pass along
p60572
aVMyself and my good cousin Buckingham
p60573
aVWill to your mother to entreat of her
p60574
aVTo meet you at the Tower and welcome you
p60575
aVWhat will you go unto the Tower my lord
p60576
aVMy Lord Protector needs will have it so
p60577
aVI shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower
p60578
aVWhy what should you fear
p60579
aVMarry my uncle Clarence\u2019 angry ghost
p60580
aVMy grandam told me he was murdered there
p60581
aVI fear no uncles dead
p60582
aVNor none that live I hope
p60583
aVAn if they live I hope I need not fear
p60584
aVTo York But come my lord With a heavy heart
p60585
aVThinking on them go I unto the Tower
p60586
aVThink you my lord this little prating York
p60587
aVWas not incensèd by his subtle mother
p60588
aVTo taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously
p60589
aVNo doubt no doubt O \u2019tis a parlous boy
p60590
aVBold quick ingenious forward capable

aVHe is all the mother\u2019s from the top to toe
p60592
aVWell let them rest Come hither Catesby
p60593
aVThou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend
p60594
aVAs closely to conceal what we impart
p60595
aVThou knowest our reasons urged upon the way
p60596
aVWhat thinkest thou Is it not an easy matter
p60597
aVTo make William Lord Hastings of our mind
p60598
aVFor the installment of this noble duke
p60599
aVIn the seat royal of this famous isle
p60600
aVHe for his father\u2019s sake so loves the Prince
p60601
aVThat he will not be won to aught against him
p60602
aVWhat think\u2019st thou then of Stanley Will not he
p60603
aVHe will do all in all as Hastings doth
p60604
aVWell then no more but this go gentle Catesby
p60605
aVAnd as it were far off sound thou Lord Hastings
p60606
aVHow he doth stand affected to our purpose
p60607
aVAnd summon him tomorrow to the Tower
p60608
aVTo sit about the coronation
p60609
aVIf thou dost find him tractable to us
p60610
aVEncourage him and tell him all our reasons
p60611
aVIf he be leaden icy cold unwilling
p60612
aVBe thou so too and so break off the talk
p60613
aVAnd give us notice of his inclination
p60614
aVFor we tomorrow hold divided councils
p60615
aVWherein thyself shalt highly be employed
p60616
aVCommend me to Lord William Tell him Catesby
p60617
aVHis ancient knot of dangerous adversaries

p60619
aVAnd bid my lord for joy of this good news
p60620
aVGive Mistress Shore one gentle kiss the more
p60621
aVGood Catesby go effect this business soundly
p60622
aVMy good lords both with all the heed I can
p60623
aVShall we hear from you Catesby ere we sleep
p60624
aVYou shall my lord
p60625
aVAt Crosby House there shall you find us both
p60626
aVNow my lord what shall we do if we perceive
p60627
aVLord Hastings will not yield to our complots
p60628
aVChop off his head Something we will determine
p60629
aVAnd look when I am king claim thou of me
p60630
aVThe earldom of Hereford and all the movables
p60631
aVWhereof the King my brother was possessed
p60632
aVI\u2019ll claim that promise at your Grace\u2019s hand
p60633
aVAnd look to have it yielded with all kindness
p60634
aVCome let us sup betimes that afterwards
p60635
aVWe may digest our complots in some form
p60636
aVMy lord my lord
p60637
aVWho knocks
p60638
aVOne from the Lord Stanley
p60639
aVWhat is \u2019t o\u2019clock
p60640
aVUpon the stroke of four
p60641
aVCannot my Lord Stanley sleep these tedious nights
p60642
aVSo it appears by that I have to say
p60643
aVFirst he commends him to your noble self
p60644
aVWhat then
p60645
aVThen certifies your Lordship that this night
p60646
aVHe dreamt the boar had razèd off his helm
p60647
aVBesides he says there are two councils kept
p60648
aVAnd that may be determined at the one
p60649
aVWhich may make you and him to rue at th\u2019 other
p60650
aVTherefore he sends to know your Lordship\u2019s pleasure
p60651
aVIf you will presently take horse with him
p60652
aVAnd with all speed post with him toward the north
p60653
aVTo shun the danger that his soul divines
p60654
aVGo fellow go Return unto thy lord
p60655
aVBid him not fear the separated council
p60656
aVHis Honor and myself are at the one
p60657
aVAnd at the other is my good friend Catesby
p60658
aVWhere nothing can proceed that toucheth us
p60659
aVWhereof I shall not have intelligence
p60660
aVTell him his fears are shallow without instance
p60661
aVAnd for his dreams I wonder he\u2019s so simple
p60662
aVTo trust the mock\u2019ry of unquiet slumbers
p60663
aVTo fly the boar before the boar pursues
p60664
aVWere to incense the boar to follow us
p60665
aVAnd make pursuit where he did mean no chase
p60666
aVGo bid thy master rise and come to me
p60667
aVAnd we will both together to the Tower
p60668
aVWhere he shall see the boar will use us kindly
p60669
aVI\u2019ll go my lord and tell him what you say
p60670
aVMany good morrows to my noble lord
p60671
aVGood morrow Catesby You are early stirring
p60672
aVWhat news what news in this our tott\u2019ring state
p60673
aVIt is a reeling world indeed my lord
p60674
aVAnd I believe will never stand upright
p60675
aVTill Richard wear the garland of the realm
p60676
aVHow wear the garland Dost thou mean the crown
p60677
aVAy my good lord
p60678
aVI\u2019ll have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders
p60679
aVBefore I\u2019ll see the crown so foul misplaced
p60680
aVBut canst thou guess that he doth aim at it
p60681
aVAy on my life and hopes to find you forward
p60682
aVUpon his party for the gain thereof
p60683
aVAnd thereupon he sends you this good news
p60684
aVThat this same very day your enemies
p60685
aVThe kindred of the Queen must die at Pomfret
p60686
aVIndeed I am no mourner for that news
p60687
aVBecause they have been still my adversaries
p60688
aVBut that I\u2019ll give my voice on Richard\u2019s side
p60689
aVTo bar my master\u2019s heirs in true descent
p60690
aVGod knows I will not do it to the death
p60691
aVGod keep your Lordship in that gracious mind
p60692
aVBut I shall laugh at this a twelve-month hence
p60693
aVThat they which brought me in my master\u2019s hate
p60694
aVI live to look upon their tragedy
p60695
aVWell Catesby ere a fortnight make me older
p60696
aVI\u2019ll send some packing that yet think not on \u2019t
p60697
aV\u2019Tis a vile thing to die my gracious lord
p60698
aVWhen men are unprepared and look not for it
p60699
aVO monstrous monstrous And so falls it out
p60700
aVWith Rivers Vaughan Grey and so \u2019twill do
p60701
aVWith some men else that think themselves as safe
p60702
aVAs thou and I who as thou know\u2019st are dear
p60703
aVTo princely Richard and to Buckingham
p60704
aVThe Princes both make high account of you
p60705
aVAside For they account his head upon the Bridge
p60706
aVI know they do and I have well deserved it
p60707
aVCome on come on Where is your boar-spear man
p60708
aVFear you the boar and go so unprovided
p60709
aVMy lord good morrow Good morrow Catesby
p60710
aVYou may jest on but by the Holy Rood
p60711
aVI do not like these several councils I
p60712
aVMy lord I hold my life as dear as you do yours
p60713
aVAnd never in my days I do protest
p60714
aVWas it so precious to me as \u2019tis now
p60715
aVThink you but that I know our state secure
p60716
aVI would be so triumphant as I am
p60717
aVThe lords at Pomfret when they rode from London
p60718
aVWere jocund and supposed their states were sure
p60719
aVAnd they indeed had no cause to mistrust
p60720
aVBut yet you see how soon the day o\u2019ercast
p60721
aVThis sudden stab of rancor I misdoubt
p60722
aVPray God I say I prove a needless coward
p60723
aVWhat shall we toward the Tower The day is spent
p60724
aVCome come Have with you Wot you what my lord
p60725
aVToday the lords you talked of are beheaded
p60726
aVThey for their truth might better wear their heads
p60727
aVThan some that have accused them wear their hats
p60728
aVBut come my lord let\u2019s away
p60729
aVGo on before I\u2019ll talk with this good fellow
p60730

aVThe better that your Lordship please to ask
p60732
aVI tell thee man \u2019tis better with me now
p60733
aVThan when thou met\u2019st me last where now we meet
p60734
aVThen was I going prisoner to the Tower
p60735
aVBy the suggestion of the Queen\u2019s allies
p60736
aVBut now I tell thee keep it to thyself
p60737
aVThis day those enemies are put to death
p60738
aVAnd I in better state than e\u2019er I was

p60749
aVYour Honor hath no shriving work in hand
p60750
aVGood faith and when I met this holy man
p60751
aVThe men you talk of came into my mind
p60752

p60759
aVSir Richard Ratcliffe let me tell thee this
p60760
aVToday shalt thou behold a subject die
p60761
aVFor truth for duty and for loyalty
p60762
aVGod bless the Prince from all the pack of you
p60763
aVA knot you are of damnèd bloodsuckers

aVYou live that shall cry woe for this hereafter
p60765
aVDispatch The limit of your lives is out
p60766
aVO Pomfret Pomfret O thou bloody prison
p60767
aVFatal and ominous to noble peers
p60768
aVWithin the guilty closure of thy walls
p60769
aVRichard the Second here was hacked to death
p60770
aVAnd for more slander to thy dismal seat
p60771
aVWe give to thee our guiltless blood to drink
p60772
aVNow Margaret\u2019s curse is fall\u2019n upon our heads
p60773
aVWhen she exclaimed on Hastings you and I
p60774
aVFor standing by when Richard stabbed her son
p60775
aVThen cursed she Richard Then cursed she Buckingham
p60776
aVThen cursed she Hastings O remember God
p60777
aVTo hear her prayer for them as now for us
p60778
aVAnd for my sister and her princely sons
p60779
aVBe satisfied dear God with our true blood
p60780
aVWhich as thou know\u2019st unjustly must be spilt
p60781
aVMake haste The hour of death is expiate
p60782
aVCome Grey Come Vaughan Let us here embrace
p60783
aVFarewell until we meet again in heaven
p60784
aVNow noble peers the cause why we are met
p60785
aVIs to determine of the coronation
p60786
aVIn God\u2019s name speak When is the royal day
p60787
aVIs all things ready for the royal time
p60788
aVIt is and wants but nomination
p60789
aVTomorrow then I judge a happy day
p60790
aVWho knows the Lord Protector\u2019s mind herein
p60791
aVWho is most inward with the noble duke
p60792
aVYour Grace we think should soonest know his mind
p60793
aVWe know each other\u2019s faces for our hearts
p60794
aVHe knows no more of mine than I of yours
p60795
aVOr I of his my lord than you of mine
p60796
aVLord Hastings you and he are near in love
p60797
aVI thank his Grace I know he loves me well
p60798
aVBut for his purpose in the coronation
p60799
aVI have not sounded him nor he delivered
p60800
aVHis gracious pleasure any way therein
p60801
aVBut you my honorable lords may name the time
p60802
aVAnd in the Duke\u2019s behalf I\u2019ll give my voice
p60803
aVWhich I presume he\u2019ll take in gentle part
p60804
aVIn happy time here comes the Duke himself
p60805
aVMy noble lords and cousins all good morrow
p60806
aVI have been long a sleeper but I trust
p60807
aVMy absence doth neglect no great design
p60808
aVWhich by my presence might have been concluded
p60809
aVHad you not come upon your cue my lord
p60810
aVWilliam Lord Hastings had pronounced your part
p60811
aVI mean your voice for crowning of the King
p60812
aVThan my Lord Hastings no man might be bolder
p60813
aVHis Lordship knows me well and loves me well
p60814
aVMy lord of Ely when I was last in Holborn
p60815
aVI saw good strawberries in your garden there
p60816
aVI do beseech you send for some of them
p60817
aVMarry and will my lord with all my heart
p60818
aVCousin of Buckingham a word with you
p60819
aVCatesby hath sounded Hastings in our business
p60820
aVAnd finds the testy gentleman so hot
p60821
aVThat he will lose his head ere give consent
p60822
aVHis master\u2019s child as worshipfully he terms it
p60823
aVShall lose the royalty of England\u2019s throne
p60824
aVWithdraw yourself awhile I\u2019ll go with you
p60825
aVWe have not yet set down this day of triumph
p60826
aVTomorrow in my judgment is too sudden
p60827
aVFor I myself am not so well provided
p60828
aVAs else I would be were the day prolonged
p60829
aVWhere is my lord the Duke of Gloucester
p60830
aVI have sent for these strawberries
p60831
aVHis Grace looks cheerfully and smooth this morning
p60832
aVThere\u2019s some conceit or other likes him well
p60833
aVWhen that he bids good morrow with such spirit
p60834
aVI think there\u2019s never a man in Christendom
p60835
aVCan lesser hide his love or hate than he
p60836
aVFor by his face straight shall you know his heart
p60837
aVWhat of his heart perceive you in his face
p60838
aVBy any livelihood he showed today
p60839
aVMarry that with no man here he is offended
p60840
aVFor were he he had shown it in his looks
p60841
aVI pray you all tell me what they deserve
p60842
aVThat do conspire my death with devilish plots
p60843
aVOf damnèd witchcraft and that have prevailed
p60844
aVUpon my body with their hellish charms
p60845
aVThe tender love I bear your Grace my lord
p60846
aVMakes me most forward in this princely presence
p60847
aVTo doom th\u2019 offenders whosoe\u2019er they be
p60848
aVI say my lord they have deservèd death
p60849
aVThen be your eyes the witness of their evil
p60850
aVLook how I am bewitched Behold mine arm
p60851
aVIs like a blasted sapling withered up
p60852
aVAnd this is Edward\u2019s wife that monstrous witch
p60853
aVConsorted with that harlot strumpet Shore
p60854
aVThat by their witchcraft thus have markèd me
p60855
aVIf they have done this deed my noble lord
p60856
aVIf Thou protector of this damnèd strumpet
p60857
aVTalk\u2019st thou to me of ifs Thou art a traitor
p60858
aVOff with his head Now by Saint Paul I swear
p60859
aVI will not dine until I see the same
p60860
aVLovell and Ratcliffe look that it be done
p60861
aVThe rest that love me rise and follow me
p60862
aVWoe woe for England Not a whit for me
p60863
aVFor I too fond might have prevented this
p60864
aVStanley did dream the boar did raze his helm
p60865
aVAnd I did scorn it and disdain to fly
p60866
aVThree times today my foot-cloth horse did stumble
p60867
aVAnd started when he looked upon the Tower
p60868
aVAs loath to bear me to the slaughterhouse
p60869
aVO now I need the priest that spake to me
p60870
aVI now repent I told the pursuivant
p60871
aVAs too triumphing how mine enemies
p60872
aVToday at Pomfret bloodily were butchered
p60873
aVAnd I myself secure in grace and favor
p60874
aVO Margaret Margaret now thy heavy curse
p60875
aVIs lighted on poor Hastings\u2019 wretched head
p60876
aVCome come dispatch The Duke would be at dinner
p60877
aVMake a short shrift He longs to see your head
p60878
aVO momentary grace of mortal men
p60879
aVWhich we more hunt for than the grace of God
p60880
aVWho builds his hope in air of your good looks
p60881
aVLives like a drunken sailor on a mast
p60882
aVReady with every nod to tumble down
p60883
aVInto the fatal bowels of the deep
p60884
aVCome come dispatch \u2019Tis bootless to exclaim
p60885
aVO bloody Richard Miserable England
p60886
aVI prophesy the fearfull\u2019st time to thee
p60887
aVThat ever wretched age hath looked upon
p60888
aVCome lead me to the block Bear him my head
p60889
aVThey smile at me who shortly shall be dead
p60890
aVCome cousin canst thou quake and change thy color
p60891
aVMurder thy breath in middle of a word
p60892
aVAnd then again begin and stop again
p60893
aVAs if thou were distraught and mad with terror
p60894
aVTut I can counterfeit the deep tragedian
p60895
aVSpeak and look back and pry on every side
p60896
aVTremble and start at wagging of a straw
p60897
aVIntending deep suspicion Ghastly looks
p60898
aVAre at my service like enforcèd smiles
p60899
aVAnd both are ready in their offices
p60900
aVAt any time to grace my stratagems
p60901
aVBut what is Catesby gone
p60902
aVHe is and see he brings the Mayor along
p60903
aVLord Mayor
p60904
aVLook to the drawbridge there
p60905
aVHark a drum
p60906
aVCatesby o\u2019erlook the walls
p60907
aVLord Mayor the reason we have sent
p60908
aVLook back Defend thee Here are enemies
p60909
aVGod and our innocence defend and guard us
p60910
aVBe patient They are friends Ratcliffe and Lovell
p60911
aVHere is the head of that ignoble traitor
p60912
aVThe dangerous and unsuspected Hastings
p60913
aVSo dear I loved the man that I must weep
p60914
aVI took him for the plainest harmless creature
p60915
aVThat breathed upon the Earth a Christian
p60916
aVMade him my book wherein my soul recorded
p60917
aVThe history of all her secret thoughts
p60918
aVSo smooth he daubed his vice with show of virtue
p60919
aVThat his apparent open guilt omitted
p60920
aVI mean his conversation with Shore\u2019s wife
p60921
aVHe lived from all attainder of suspects
p60922
aVWell well he was the covert\u2019st sheltered traitor
p60923
aVThat ever lived
p60924
aVWould you imagine or almost believe
p60925
aVWere \u2019t not that by great preservation
p60926
aVWe live to tell it that the subtle traitor
p60927
aVThis day had plotted in the council house
p60928
aVTo murder me and my good lord of Gloucester
p60929
aVHad he done so
p60930
aVWhat think you we are Turks or infidels
p60931
aVOr that we would against the form of law
p60932
aVProceed thus rashly in the villain\u2019s death
p60933
aVBut that the extreme peril of the case
p60934
aVThe peace of England and our persons\u2019 safety
p60935
aVEnforced us to this execution
p60936
aVNow fair befall you He deserved his death
p60937
aVAnd your good Graces both have well proceeded
p60938
aVTo warn false traitors from the like attempts
p60939
aVI never looked for better at his hands
p60940
aVAfter he once fell in with Mistress Shore
p60941
aVYet had we not determined he should die
p60942
aVUntil your Lordship came to see his end
p60943
aVWhich now the loving haste of these our friends
p60944
aVSomething against our meanings have prevented
p60945
aVBecause my lord I would have had you heard
p60946
aVThe traitor speak and timorously confess
p60947
aVThe manner and the purpose of his treasons
p60948
aVThat you might well have signified the same
p60949
aVUnto the citizens who haply may
p60950
aVMisconster us in him and wail his death
p60951
aVBut my good lord your Graces\u2019 words shall serve
p60952
aVAs well as I had seen and heard him speak
p60953
aVAnd do not doubt right noble princes both
p60954
aVBut I\u2019ll acquaint our duteous citizens
p60955
aVWith all your just proceedings in this case
p60956
aVAnd to that end we wished your Lordship here
p60957
aVT\u2019 avoid the censures of the carping world
p60958
aVWhich since you come too late of our intent
p60959
aVYet witness what you hear we did intend
p60960
aVAnd so my good Lord Mayor we bid farewell
p60961
aVGo after after cousin Buckingham
p60962
aVThe Mayor towards Guildhall hies him in all post
p60963
aVThere at your meetest vantage of the time
p60964
aVInfer the bastardy of Edward\u2019s children
p60965
aVTell them how Edward put to death a citizen
p60966
aVOnly for saying he would make his son
p60967
aVHeir to the Crown meaning indeed his house
p60968
aVWhich by the sign thereof was termèd so
p60969
aVMoreover urge his hateful luxury
p60970
aVAnd bestial appetite in change of lust
p60971
aVWhich stretched unto their servants daughters wives
p60972
aVEven where his raging eye or savage heart
p60973
aVWithout control lusted to make a prey
p60974
aVNay for a need thus far come near my person
p60975
aVTell them when that my mother went with child
p60976
aVOf that insatiate Edward noble York
p60977
aVMy princely father then had wars in France
p60978
aVAnd by true computation of the time
p60979
aVFound that the issue was not his begot
p60980
aVWhich well appearèd in his lineaments
p60981
aVBeing nothing like the noble duke my father
p60982
aVYet touch this sparingly as \u2019twere far off
p60983
aVBecause my lord you know my mother lives
p60984
aVDoubt not my lord I\u2019ll play the orator
p60985
aVAs if the golden fee for which I plead
p60986
aVWere for myself And so my lord adieu
p60987
aVIf you thrive well bring them to Baynard\u2019s Castle
p60988
aVWhere you shall find me well accompanied
p60989
aVWith reverend fathers and well-learnèd bishops
p60990
aVI go and towards three or four o\u2019clock
p60991
aVLook for the news that the Guildhall affords
p60992
aVGo Lovell with all speed to Doctor Shaa
p60993
aVTo Ratcliffe Go thou to Friar Penker Bid them both
p60994
aVMeet me within this hour at Baynard\u2019s Castle
p60995
aVNow will I go to take some privy order
p60996
aVTo draw the brats of Clarence out of sight
p60997
aVAnd to give order that no manner person
p60998
aVHave any time recourse unto the Princes

aVHere is the indictment of the good Lord Hastings
p61000
aVWhich in a set hand fairly is engrossed
p61001
aVThat it may be today read o\u2019er in Paul\u2019s
p61002
aVAnd mark how well the sequel hangs together
p61003
aVEleven hours I have spent to write it over
p61004
aVFor yesternight by Catesby was it sent me
p61005
aVThe precedent was full as long a-doing
p61006
aVAnd yet within these five hours Hastings lived
p61007
aVUntainted unexamined free at liberty
p61008
aVHere\u2019s a good world the while Who is so gross
p61009
aVThat cannot see this palpable device
p61010
aVYet who so bold but says he sees it not
p61011
aVBad is the world and all will come to naught
p61012
aVWhen such ill dealing must be seen in thought
p61013
aVHow now how now What say the citizens
p61014
aVNow by the holy mother of our Lord
p61015
aVThe citizens are mum say not a word
p61016
aVTouched you the bastardy of Edward\u2019s children
p61017
aVI did with his contract with Lady Lucy
p61018
aVAnd his contract by deputy in France
p61019
aVTh\u2019 unsatiate greediness of his desire
p61020
aVAnd his enforcement of the city wives
p61021
aVHis tyranny for trifles his own bastardy
p61022
aVAs being got your father then in France
p61023
aVAnd his resemblance being not like the Duke
p61024
aVWithal I did infer your lineaments
p61025
aVBeing the right idea of your father
p61026
aVBoth in your form and nobleness of mind
p61027
aVLaid open all your victories in Scotland
p61028
aVYour discipline in war wisdom in peace
p61029
aVYour bounty virtue fair humility
p61030
aVIndeed left nothing fitting for your purpose
p61031
aVUntouched or slightly handled in discourse
p61032
aVAnd when mine oratory drew toward end
p61033
aVI bid them that did love their country\u2019s good
p61034
aVCry God save Richard England\u2019s royal king
p61035
aVAnd did they so
p61036
aVNo So God help me they spake not a word
p61037
aVBut like dumb statues or breathing stones
p61038
aVStared each on other and looked deadly pale
p61039
aVWhich when I saw I reprehended them
p61040
aVAnd asked the Mayor what meant this willful silence
p61041
aVHis answer was the people were not used
p61042
aVTo be spoke to but by the Recorder
p61043
aVThen he was urged to tell my tale again
p61044
aVThus saith the Duke Thus hath the Duke inferred
p61045
aVBut nothing spoke in warrant from himself
p61046
aVWhen he had done some followers of mine own
p61047
aVAt lower end of the hall hurled up their caps
p61048
aVAnd some ten voices cried God save King Richard
p61049
aVAnd thus I took the vantage of those few
p61050
aVThanks gentle citizens and friends quoth I
p61051
aVThis general applause and cheerful shout
p61052
aVArgues your wisdoms and your love to Richard
p61053
aVAnd even here brake off and came away
p61054
aVWhat tongueless blocks were they Would they not speak
p61055
aVWill not the Mayor then and his brethren come
p61056
aVThe Mayor is here at hand Intend some fear
p61057
aVBe not you spoke with but by mighty suit
p61058
aVAnd look you get a prayer book in your hand
p61059
aVAnd stand between two churchmen good my lord
p61060
aVFor on that ground I\u2019ll make a holy descant
p61061
aVAnd be not easily won to our requests
p61062
aVPlay the maid\u2019s part still answer nay and take it
p61063
aVI go An if you plead as well for them
p61064
aVAs I can say nay to thee for myself
p61065
aVNo doubt we bring it to a happy issue
p61066
aVGo go up to the leads The Lord Mayor knocks
p61067
aVWelcome my lord I dance attendance here
p61068
aVI think the Duke will not be spoke withal
p61069
aVNow Catesby what says your lord to my request
p61070
aVHe doth entreat your Grace my noble lord
p61071
aVTo visit him tomorrow or next day
p61072
aVHe is within with two right reverend fathers
p61073
aVDivinely bent to meditation
p61074
aVAnd in no worldly suits would he be moved
p61075
aVTo draw him from his holy exercise
p61076
aVReturn good Catesby to the gracious duke
p61077
aVTell him myself the Mayor and aldermen
p61078
aVIn deep designs in matter of great moment
p61079
aVNo less importing than our general good
p61080
aVAre come to have some conference with his Grace
p61081
aVI\u2019ll signify so much unto him straight
p61082
aVAh ha my lord this prince is not an Edward
p61083
aVHe is not lolling on a lewd love-bed
p61084
aVBut on his knees at meditation
p61085
aVNot dallying with a brace of courtesans
p61086
aVBut meditating with two deep divines
p61087
aVNot sleeping to engross his idle body
p61088
aVBut praying to enrich his watchful soul
p61089
aVHappy were England would this virtuous prince
p61090
aVTake on his Grace the sovereignty thereof
p61091
aVBut sure I fear we shall not win him to it
p61092
aVMarry God defend his Grace should say us nay
p61093
aVI fear he will Here Catesby comes again
p61094
aVNow Catesby what says his Grace
p61095
aVHe wonders to what end you have assembled
p61096
aVSuch troops of citizens to come to him
p61097
aVHis Grace not being warned thereof before
p61098
aVHe fears my lord you mean no good to him
p61099
aVSorry I am my noble cousin should
p61100
aVSuspect me that I mean no good to him
p61101
aVBy heaven we come to him in perfect love
p61102
aVAnd so once more return and tell his Grace
p61103
aVWhen holy and devout religious men
p61104
aVAre at their beads \u2019tis much to draw them thence
p61105
aVSo sweet is zealous contemplation
p61106
aVSee where his Grace stands \u2019tween two clergymen
p61107
aVTwo props of virtue for a Christian prince
p61108
aVTo stay him from the fall of vanity
p61109
aVAnd see a book of prayer in his hand
p61110
aVTrue ornaments to know a holy man
p61111
aVFamous Plantagenet most gracious prince
p61112
aVLend favorable ear to our requests
p61113
aVAnd pardon us the interruption
p61114
aVOf thy devotion and right Christian zeal
p61115
aVMy lord there needs no such apology
p61116
aVI do beseech your Grace to pardon me
p61117
aVWho earnest in the service of my God
p61118
aVDeferred the visitation of my friends
p61119
aVBut leaving this what is your Grace\u2019s pleasure
p61120
aVEven that I hope which pleaseth God above
p61121
aVAnd all good men of this ungoverned isle
p61122
aVI do suspect I have done some offense
p61123
aVThat seems disgracious in the city\u2019s eye
p61124
aVAnd that you come to reprehend my ignorance
p61125
aVYou have my lord Would it might please your Grace
p61126
aVOn our entreaties to amend your fault
p61127
aVElse wherefore breathe I in a Christian land
p61128
aVKnow then it is your fault that you resign
p61129
aVThe supreme seat the throne majestical
p61130
aVThe sceptered office of your ancestors
p61131
aVYour state of fortune and your due of birth
p61132
aVThe lineal glory of your royal house
p61133
aVTo the corruption of a blemished stock
p61134
aVWhiles in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts
p61135
aVWhich here we waken to our country\u2019s good
p61136
aVThe noble isle doth want her proper limbs
p61137
aVHer face defaced with scars of infamy
p61138
aVHer royal stock graft with ignoble plants
p61139
aVAnd almost shouldered in the swallowing gulf
p61140
aVOf dark forgetfulness and deep oblivion
p61141
aVWhich to recure we heartily solicit
p61142
aVYour gracious self to take on you the charge
p61143
aVAnd kingly government of this your land
p61144
aVNot as Protector steward substitute
p61145
aVOr lowly factor for another\u2019s gain
p61146
aVBut as successively from blood to blood
p61147
aVYour right of birth your empery your own
p61148
aVFor this consorted with the citizens
p61149
aVYour very worshipful and loving friends
p61150
aVAnd by their vehement instigation
p61151
aVIn this just cause come I to move your Grace
p61152
aVI cannot tell if to depart in silence
p61153
aVOr bitterly to speak in your reproof
p61154
aVBest fitteth my degree or your condition
p61155
aVIf not to answer you might haply think
p61156
aVTongue-tied ambition not replying yielded
p61157
aVTo bear the golden yoke of sovereignty
p61158
aVWhich fondly you would here impose on me
p61159
aVIf to reprove you for this suit of yours
p61160
aVSo seasoned with your faithful love to me
p61161
aVThen on the other side I checked my friends
p61162
aVTherefore to speak and to avoid the first
p61163
aVAnd then in speaking not to incur the last
p61164
aVDefinitively thus I answer you
p61165
aVYour love deserves my thanks but my desert
p61166
aVUnmeritable shuns your high request
p61167
aVFirst if all obstacles were cut away
p61168
aVAnd that my path were even to the crown
p61169
aVAs the ripe revenue and due of birth
p61170
aVYet so much is my poverty of spirit
p61171
aVSo mighty and so many my defects
p61172
aVThat I would rather hide me from my greatness
p61173
aVBeing a bark to brook no mighty sea
p61174
aVThan in my greatness covet to be hid
p61175
aVAnd in the vapor of my glory smothered
p61176
aVBut God be thanked there is no need of me
p61177
aVAnd much I need to help you were there need
p61178
aVThe royal tree hath left us royal fruit
p61179
aVWhich mellowed by the stealing hours of time
p61180
aVWill well become the seat of majesty
p61181
aVAnd make no doubt us happy by his reign
p61182
aVOn him I lay that you would lay on me
p61183
aVThe right and fortune of his happy stars
p61184
aVWhich God defend that I should wring from him
p61185
aVMy lord this argues conscience in your Grace
p61186
aVBut the respects thereof are nice and trivial
p61187
aVAll circumstances well considerèd
p61188
aVYou say that Edward is your brother\u2019s son
p61189
aVSo say we too but not by Edward\u2019s wife
p61190
aVFor first was he contract to Lady Lucy
p61191
aVYour mother lives a witness to his vow
p61192
aVAnd afterward by substitute betrothed
p61193
aVTo Bona sister to the King of France
p61194
aVThese both put off a poor petitioner
p61195
aVA care-crazed mother to a many sons
p61196
aVA beauty-waning and distressèd widow
p61197
aVEven in the afternoon of her best days
p61198
aVMade prize and purchase of his wanton eye
p61199
aVSeduced the pitch and height of his degree
p61200
aVTo base declension and loathed bigamy
p61201
aVBy her in his unlawful bed he got
p61202
aVThis Edward whom our manners call the Prince
p61203
aVMore bitterly could I expostulate
p61204
aVSave that for reverence to some alive
p61205
aVI give a sparing limit to my tongue
p61206
aVThen good my lord take to your royal self
p61207
aVThis proffered benefit of dignity
p61208
aVIf not to bless us and the land withal
p61209
aVYet to draw forth your noble ancestry
p61210
aVFrom the corruption of abusing times
p61211
aVUnto a lineal true-derivèd course
p61212
aVDo good my lord Your citizens entreat you
p61213
aVRefuse not mighty lord this proffered love
p61214
aVO make them joyful Grant their lawful suit
p61215
aVAlas why would you heap this care on me
p61216
aVI am unfit for state and majesty
p61217
aVI do beseech you take it not amiss
p61218
aVI cannot nor I will not yield to you
p61219
aVIf you refuse it as in love and zeal
p61220
aVLoath to depose the child your brother\u2019s son
p61221
aVAs well we know your tenderness of heart
p61222
aVAnd gentle kind effeminate remorse
p61223
aVWhich we have noted in you to your kindred
p61224
aVAnd equally indeed to all estates
p61225
aVYet know whe\u2019er you accept our suit or no
p61226
aVYour brother\u2019s son shall never reign our king
p61227
aVBut we will plant some other in the throne
p61228
aVTo the disgrace and downfall of your house
p61229
aVAnd in this resolution here we leave you
p61230
aVCome citizens Zounds I\u2019ll entreat no more
p61231
aVO do not swear my lord of Buckingham
p61232
aVCall him again sweet prince Accept their suit
p61233
aVIf you deny them all the land will rue it
p61234
aVWill you enforce me to a world of cares
p61235
aVCall them again I am not made of stones
p61236
aVBut penetrable to your kind entreaties
p61237
aVAlbeit against my conscience and my soul
p61238
aVCousin of Buckingham and sage grave men
p61239
aVSince you will buckle Fortune on my back
p61240
aVTo bear her burden whe\u2019er I will or no
p61241
aVI must have patience to endure the load
p61242
aVBut if black scandal or foul-faced reproach
p61243
aVAttend the sequel of your imposition
p61244
aVYour mere enforcement shall acquittance me
p61245
aVFrom all the impure blots and stains thereof
p61246
aVFor God doth know and you may partly see
p61247
aVHow far I am from the desire of this
p61248
aVGod bless your Grace We see it and will say it
p61249
aVIn saying so you shall but say the truth
p61250
aVThen I salute you with this royal title

aVRichmond When last I was at Exeter
p61470
aVThe Mayor in courtesy showed me the castle
p61471
aVAnd called it Rougemont at which name I started

aVBecause a bard of Ireland told me once

aVI should not live long after I saw Richmond
p61474
aVMy lord
p61475
aVAy what\u2019s o\u2019clock

aVAnd is it thus Repays he my deep service
p61488
aVWith such contempt Made I him king for this
p61489

p61490
aVTo Brecknock while my fearful head is on
p61491
aVThe tyrannous and bloody act is done
p61492
aVThe most arch deed of piteous massacre
p61493
aVThat ever yet this land was guilty of
p61494
aVDighton and Forrest who I did suborn
p61495
aVTo do this piece of ruthless butchery
p61496
aVAlbeit they were fleshed villains bloody dogs
p61497
aVMelted with tenderness and mild compassion
p61498
aVWept like two children in their deaths\u2019 sad story
p61499
aVO thus quoth Dighton lay the gentle babes
p61500
aVThus thus quoth Forrest girdling one another
p61501
aVWithin their alabaster innocent arms
p61502
aVTheir lips were four red roses on a stalk
p61503
aVAnd in their summer beauty kissed each other
p61504
aVA book of prayers on their pillow lay
p61505
aVWhich once quoth Forrest almost changed my mind
p61506
aVBut O the devil There the villain stopped
p61507
aVWhen Dighton thus told on We smotherèd
p61508
aVThe most replenishèd sweet work of nature
p61509
aVThat from the prime creation e\u2019er she framed
p61510
aVHence both are gone with conscience and remorse
p61511
aVThey could not speak and so I left them both
p61512
aVTo bear this tidings to the bloody king

aVAnd here he comes All health my sovereign lord

p61519
aVI did my lord
p61520
aVAnd buried gentle Tyrrel
p61521
aVThe chaplain of the Tower hath buried them
p61522
aVBut where to say the truth I do not know
p61523
aVCome to me Tyrrel soon at after-supper
p61524
aVWhen thou shalt tell the process of their death
p61525
aVMeantime but think how I may do thee good
p61526
aVAnd be inheritor of thy desire
p61527
aVFarewell till then
p61528
aVI humbly take my leave
p61529
aVThe son of Clarence have I pent up close
p61530
aVHis daughter meanly have I matched in marriage
p61531
aVThe sons of Edward sleep in Abraham\u2019s bosom
p61532
aVAnd Anne my wife hath bid this world goodnight
p61533
aVNow for I know the Breton Richmond aims

aVAnd by that knot looks proudly on the crown

aVTo her go I a jolly thriving wooer

aVGood or bad news that thou com\u2019st in so bluntly
p61539
aVBad news my lord Morton is fled to Richmond
p61540
aVAnd Buckingham backed with the hardy Welshmen
p61541
aVIs in the field and still his power increaseth
p61542
aVEly with Richmond troubles me more near
p61543
aVThan Buckingham and his rash-levied strength
p61544
aVCome I have learned that fearful commenting
p61545
aVIs leaden servitor to dull delay
p61546
aVDelay leads impotent and snail-paced beggary

aVSo now prosperity begins to mellow
p61552
aVAnd drop into the rotten mouth of death
p61553
aVHere in these confines slyly have I lurked
p61554
aVTo watch the waning of mine enemies
p61555

aVBy thee old Capulet and Montague
p62634
aVHave thrice disturbed the quiet of our streets
p62635
aVAnd made Verona\u2019s ancient citizens
p62636
aVCast by their grave-beseeming ornaments
p62637
aVTo wield old partisans in hands as old
p62638
aVCankered with peace to part your cankered hate

aVTo know our farther pleasure in this case
p62645
aVTo old Free-town our common judgment-place

p62647
aVWho set this ancient quarrel new abroach
p62648
aVSpeak nephew were you by when it began
p62649
aVHere were the servants of your adversary
p62650
aVAnd yours close fighting ere I did approach
p62651
aVI drew to part them In the instant came
p62652
aVThe fiery Tybalt with his sword prepared
p62653
aVWhich as he breathed defiance to my ears
p62654
aVHe swung about his head and cut the winds
p62655
aVWho nothing hurt withal hissed him in scorn
p62656
aVWhile we were interchanging thrusts and blows
p62657
aVCame more and more and fought on part and part
p62658
aVTill the Prince came who parted either part
p62659
aVO where is Romeo Saw you him today
p62660
aVRight glad I am he was not at this fray
p62661
aVMadam an hour before the worshiped sun
p62662
aVPeered forth the golden window of the east
p62663
aVA troubled mind drove me to walk abroad
p62664
aVWhere underneath the grove of sycamore
p62665
aVThat westward rooteth from this city side
p62666
aVSo early walking did I see your son
p62667
aVTowards him I made but he was \u2019ware of me
p62668
aVAnd stole into the covert of the wood
p62669
aVI measuring his affections by my own
p62670
aVWhich then most sought where most might not be found
p62671
aVBeing one too many by my weary self
p62672
aVPursued my humor not pursuing his
p62673
aVAnd gladly shunned who gladly fled from me
p62674
aVMany a morning hath he there been seen
p62675
aVWith tears augmenting the fresh morning\u2019s dew
p62676
aVAdding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs
p62677
aVBut all so soon as the all-cheering sun
p62678
aVShould in the farthest east begin to draw
p62679
aVThe shady curtains from Aurora\u2019s bed
p62680
aVAway from light steals home my heavy son
p62681
aVAnd private in his chamber pens himself
p62682
aVShuts up his windows locks fair daylight out
p62683
aVAnd makes himself an artificial night
p62684
aVBlack and portentous must this humor prove
p62685
aVUnless good counsel may the cause remove
p62686
aVMy noble uncle do you know the cause
p62687
aVI neither know it nor can learn of him
p62688
aVHave you importuned him by any means
p62689
aVBoth by myself and many other friends
p62690
aVBut he his own affections\u2019 counselor
p62691
aVIs to himself I will not say how true
p62692
aVBut to himself so secret and so close
p62693
aVSo far from sounding and discovery
p62694
aVAs is the bud bit with an envious worm
p62695
aVEre he can spread his sweet leaves to the air
p62696
aVOr dedicate his beauty to the same
p62697
aVCould we but learn from whence his sorrows grow
p62698
aVWe would as willingly give cure as know
p62699
aVSee where he comes So please you step aside
p62700
aVI\u2019ll know his grievance or be much denied
p62701
aVI would thou wert so happy by thy stay
p62702
aVTo hear true shrift Come madam let\u2019s away

aVIt was What sadness lengthens Romeo\u2019s hours
p62709
aVNot having that which having makes them short
p62710
aVOut of her favor where I am in love
p62711
aVAlas that love so gentle in his view
p62712
aVShould be so tyrannous and rough in proof
p62713
aVAlas that love whose view is muffled still
p62714
aVShould without eyes see pathways to his will
p62715
aVWhere shall we dine O me What fray was here
p62716
aVYet tell me not for I have heard it all
p62717
aVHere\u2019s much to do with hate but more with love

p62720
aVO heavy lightness serious vanity
p62721
aVMisshapen chaos of well-seeming forms

aVGood heart at what

aVAt thy good heart\u2019s oppression
p62729
aVWhy such is love\u2019s transgression
p62730
aVGriefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast
p62731
aVWhich thou wilt propagate to have it pressed
p62732
aVWith more of thine This love that thou hast shown
p62733
aVDoth add more grief to too much of mine own
p62734
aVLove is a smoke made with the fume of sighs
p62735
aVBeing purged a fire sparkling in lovers\u2019 eyes
p62736
aVBeing vexed a sea nourished with loving tears
p62737
aVWhat is it else A madness most discreet

p62754
aVWith Cupid\u2019s arrow She hath Dian\u2019s wit
p62755
aVAnd in strong proof of chastity well armed
p62756
aVFrom love\u2019s weak childish bow she lives uncharmed
p62757
aVShe will not stay the siege of loving terms
p62758
aVNor bide th\u2019 encounter of assailing eyes
p62759
aVNor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold
p62760
aVO she is rich in beauty only poor
p62761
aVThat when she dies with beauty dies her store
p62762
aVThen she hath sworn that she will still live chaste
p62763
aVShe hath and in that sparing makes huge waste
p62764
aVFor beauty starved with her severity
p62765
aVCuts beauty off from all posterity
p62766
aVShe is too fair too wise wisely too fair
p62767
aVTo merit bliss by making me despair
p62768
aVShe hath forsworn to love and in that vow
p62769
aVDo I live dead that live to tell it now

aVO teach me how I should forget to think
p62772
aVBy giving liberty unto thine eyes
p62773
aVExamine other beauties
p62774
aV\u2019Tis the way
p62775
aVTo call hers exquisite in question more
p62776
aVThese happy masks that kiss fair ladies\u2019 brows
p62777
aVBeing black puts us in mind they hide the fair
p62778
aVHe that is strucken blind cannot forget
p62779
aVThe precious treasure of his eyesight lost
p62780
aVShow me a mistress that is passing fair
p62781
aVWhat doth her beauty serve but as a note
p62782
aVWhere I may read who passed that passing fair
p62783
aVFarewell Thou canst not teach me to forget
p62784
aVI\u2019ll pay that doctrine or else die in debt
p62785
aVBut Montague is bound as well as I
p62786
aVIn penalty alike and \u2019tis not hard I think
p62787
aVFor men so old as we to keep the peace
p62788
aVOf honorable reckoning are you both
p62789
aVAnd pity \u2019tis you lived at odds so long

aVLet two more summers wither in their pride
p62795
aVEre we may think her ripe to be a bride
p62796
aVYounger than she are happy mothers made
p62797
aVAnd too soon marred are those so early made
p62798
aVEarth hath swallowed all my hopes but she
p62799
aVShe\u2019s the hopeful lady of my earth
p62800
aVBut woo her gentle Paris get her heart

p62977
aVTo soar with his light feathers and so bound
p62978
aVI cannot bound a pitch above dull woe
p62979
aVUnder love\u2019s heavy burden do I sink
p62980
aVAnd to sink in it should you burden love

aVAnd we mean well in going to this masque
p63007
aVBut \u2019tis no wit to go
p63008
aVWhy may one ask
p63009
aVI dreamt a dream tonight
p63010
aVAnd so did I
p63011
aVWell what was yours
p63012
aVThat dreamers often lie
p63013
aVIn bed asleep while they do dream things true
p63014
aVO then I see Queen Mab hath been with you
p63015
aVShe is the fairies\u2019 midwife and she comes
p63016
aVIn shape no bigger than an agate stone
p63017
aVOn the forefinger of an alderman
p63018
aVDrawn with a team of little atomi
p63019
aVOver men\u2019s noses as they lie asleep
p63020
aVHer wagon spokes made of long spinners\u2019 legs
p63021
aVThe cover of the wings of grasshoppers
p63022
aVHer traces of the smallest spider web
p63023
aVHer collars of the moonshine\u2019s wat\u2019ry beams
p63024
aVHer whip of cricket\u2019s bone the lash of film
p63025
aVHer wagoner a small gray-coated gnat
p63026
aVNot half so big as a round little worm
p63027
aVPricked from the lazy finger of a maid
p63028
aVHer chariot is an empty hazelnut
p63029
aVMade by the joiner squirrel or old grub
p63030
aVTime out o\u2019 mind the fairies\u2019 coachmakers
p63031
aVAnd in this state she gallops night by night
p63032
aVThrough lovers\u2019 brains and then they dream of love
p63033
aVOn courtiers\u2019 knees that dream on cur\u2019sies straight
p63034
aVO\u2019er lawyers\u2019 fingers who straight dream on fees
p63035
aVO\u2019er ladies\u2019 lips who straight on kisses dream
p63036
aVWhich oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues
p63037
aVBecause their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are
p63038
aVSometime she gallops o\u2019er a courtier\u2019s nose
p63039
aVAnd then dreams he of smelling out a suit
p63040
aVAnd sometime comes she with a tithe-pig\u2019s tail
p63041
aVTickling a parson\u2019s nose as he lies asleep
p63042
aVThen he dreams of another benefice
p63043
aVSometime she driveth o\u2019er a soldier\u2019s neck
p63044
aVAnd then dreams he of cutting foreign throats
p63045
aVOf breaches ambuscadoes Spanish blades
p63046
aVOf healths five fathom deep and then anon
p63047
aVDrums in his ear at which he starts and wakes
p63048
aVAnd being thus frighted swears a prayer or two
p63049
aVAnd sleeps again This is that very Mab
p63050
aVThat plats the manes of horses in the night
p63051
aVAnd bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs
p63052
aVWhich once untangled much misfortune bodes
p63053
aVThis is the hag when maids lie on their backs
p63054
aVThat presses them and learns them first to bear
p63055
aVMaking them women of good carriage
p63056
aVThis is she
p63057
aVPeace peace Mercutio peace
p63058
aVThou talk\u2019st of nothing
p63059
aVTrue I talk of dreams
p63060
aVWhich are the children of an idle brain
p63061
aVBegot of nothing but vain fantasy
p63062
aVWhich is as thin of substance as the air
p63063
aVAnd more inconstant than the wind who woos
p63064
aVEven now the frozen bosom of the north
p63065
aVAnd being angered puffs away from thence
p63066
aVTurning his side to the dew-dropping south
p63067
aVThis wind you talk of blows us from ourselves
p63068
aVSupper is done and we shall come too late
p63069
aVI fear too early for my mind misgives
p63070
aVSome consequence yet hanging in the stars
p63071
aVShall bitterly begin his fearful date
p63072
aVWith this night\u2019s revels and expire the term
p63073
aVOf a despisèd life closed in my breast
p63074
aVBy some vile forfeit of untimely death
p63075
aVBut he that hath the steerage of my course

aVWhat\u2019s Montague It is nor hand nor foot
p63316
aVNor arm nor face O be some other name
p63317
aVBelonging to a man
p63318
aVWhat\u2019s in a name That which we call a rose
p63319
aVBy any other word would smell as sweet
p63320
aVSo Romeo would were he not Romeo called
p63321
aVRetain that dear perfection which he owes
p63322
aVWithout that title Romeo doff thy name
p63323
aVAnd for thy name which is no part of thee
p63324
aVTake all myself
p63325
aVI take thee at thy word
p63326
aVCall me but love and I\u2019ll be new baptized
p63327
aVHenceforth I never will be Romeo
p63328
aVWhat man art thou that thus bescreened in night
p63329
aVSo stumblest on my counsel
p63330
aVBy a name
p63331
aVI know not how to tell thee who I am
p63332
aVMy name dear saint is hateful to myself
p63333
aVBecause it is an enemy to thee
p63334
aVHad I it written I would tear the word
p63335
aVMy ears have yet not drunk a hundred words
p63336
aVOf thy tongue\u2019s uttering yet I know the sound
p63337
aVArt thou not Romeo and a Montague
p63338
aVNeither fair maid if either thee dislike
p63339
aVHow camest thou hither tell me and wherefore
p63340
aVThe orchard walls are high and hard to climb
p63341
aVAnd the place death considering who thou art
p63342
aVIf any of my kinsmen find thee here
p63343
aVWith love\u2019s light wings did I o\u2019erperch these walls
p63344
aVFor stony limits cannot hold love out
p63345
aVAnd what love can do that dares love attempt
p63346
aVTherefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me
p63347
aVIf they do see thee they will murder thee
p63348
aVAlack there lies more peril in thine eye
p63349
aVThan twenty of their swords Look thou but sweet
p63350
aVAnd I am proof against their enmity
p63351
aVI would not for the world they saw thee here
p63352
aVI have night\u2019s cloak to hide me from their eyes
p63353
aVAnd but thou love me let them find me here
p63354
aVMy life were better ended by their hate
p63355
aVThan death proroguèd wanting of thy love
p63356
aVBy whose direction found\u2019st thou out this place
p63357
aVBy love that first did prompt me to inquire
p63358
aVHe lent me counsel and I lent him eyes
p63359
aVI am no pilot yet wert thou as far
p63360
aVAs that vast shore washed with the farthest sea
p63361
aVI should adventure for such merchandise
p63362
aVThou knowest the mask of night is on my face
p63363
aVElse would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
p63364
aVFor that which thou hast heard me speak tonight
p63365
aVFain would I dwell on form fain fain deny
p63366
aVWhat I have spoke But farewell compliment
p63367
aVDost thou love me I know thou wilt say Ay
p63368
aVAnd I will take thy word Yet if thou swear\u2019st
p63369
aVThou mayst prove false At lovers\u2019 perjuries
p63370
aVThey say Jove laughs O gentle Romeo
p63371
aVIf thou dost love pronounce it faithfully
p63372
aVOr if thou thinkest I am too quickly won
p63373
aVI\u2019ll frown and be perverse and say thee nay
p63374
aVSo thou wilt woo but else not for the world
p63375
aVIn truth fair Montague I am too fond
p63376
aVAnd therefore thou mayst think my havior light
p63377
aVBut trust me gentleman I\u2019ll prove more true
p63378
aVThan those that have more coying to be strange
p63379
aVI should have been more strange I must confess
p63380
aVBut that thou overheard\u2019st ere I was ware
p63381
aVMy true-love passion Therefore pardon me
p63382
aVAnd not impute this yielding to light love
p63383
aVWhich the dark night hath so discoverèd
p63384
aVLady by yonder blessèd moon I vow
p63385
aVThat tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops
p63386
aVO swear not by the moon th\u2019 inconstant moon
p63387
aVThat monthly changes in her circled orb
p63388
aVLest that thy love prove likewise variable
p63389
aVWhat shall I swear by
p63390
aVDo not swear at all
p63391
aVOr if thou wilt swear by thy gracious self
p63392
aVWhich is the god of my idolatry
p63393
aVAnd I\u2019ll believe thee
p63394
aVIf my heart\u2019s dear love
p63395
aVWell do not swear Although I joy in thee
p63396
aVI have no joy of this contract tonight
p63397
aVIt is too rash too unadvised too sudden
p63398
aVToo like the lightning which doth cease to be
p63399
aVEre one can say It lightens Sweet good night
p63400
aVThis bud of love by summer\u2019s ripening breath
p63401
aVMay prove a beauteous flower when next we meet
p63402
aVGood night good night As sweet repose and rest
p63403
aVCome to thy heart as that within my breast
p63404
aVO wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied
p63405
aVWhat satisfaction canst thou have tonight
p63406
aVTh\u2019 exchange of thy love\u2019s faithful vow for mine
p63407
aVI gave thee mine before thou didst request it
p63408
aVAnd yet I would it were to give again
p63409
aVWouldst thou withdraw it For what purpose love
p63410
aVBut to be frank and give it thee again
p63411
aVAnd yet I wish but for the thing I have
p63412
aVMy bounty is as boundless as the sea
p63413
aVMy love as deep The more I give to thee
p63414
aVThe more I have for both are infinite
p63415
aVI hear some noise within Dear love adieu
p63416
aVAnon good nurse Sweet Montague be true
p63417
aVStay but a little I will come again
p63418
aVO blessèd blessèd night I am afeard
p63419
aVBeing in night all this is but a dream
p63420
aVToo flattering sweet to be substantial
p63421
aVThree words dear Romeo and good night indeed
p63422
aVIf that thy bent of love be honorable
p63423
aVThy purpose marriage send me word tomorrow
p63424
aVBy one that I\u2019ll procure to come to thee
p63425
aVWhere and what time thou wilt perform the rite
p63426
aVAnd all my fortunes at thy foot I\u2019ll lay
p63427
aVAnd follow thee my lord throughout the world
p63428
aVI come anon But if thou meanest not well
p63429
aVI do beseech thee
p63430
aVBy and by I come
p63431
aVTo cease thy strife and leave me to my grief
p63432
aVTomorrow will I send
p63433
aVSo thrive my soul
p63434
aVA thousand times good night
p63435
aVA thousand times the worse to want thy light
p63436
aVLove goes toward love as schoolboys from their books
p63437
aVBut love from love toward school with heavy looks
p63438
aVHist Romeo hist O for a falc\u2019ner\u2019s voice
p63439
aVTo lure this tassel-gentle back again
p63440
aVBondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud
p63441
aVElse would I tear the cave where Echo lies
p63442
aVAnd make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine
p63443
aVWith repetition of My Romeo
p63444
aVIt is my soul that calls upon my name
p63445
aVHow silver-sweet sound lovers\u2019 tongues by night
p63446
aVLike softest music to attending ears
p63447
aVRomeo
p63448
aVMy dear
p63449
aVWhat o\u2019clock tomorrow
p63450
aVShall I send to thee
p63451
aVBy the hour of nine
p63452
aVI will not fail \u2019Tis twenty year till then
p63453
aVI have forgot why I did call thee back
p63454
aVLet me stand here till thou remember it
p63455
aVI shall forget to have thee still stand there
p63456
aVRememb\u2019ring how I love thy company
p63457
aVAnd I\u2019ll still stay to have thee still forget
p63458
aVForgetting any other home but this
p63459
aV\u2019Tis almost morning I would have thee gone
p63460
aVAnd yet no farther than a wanton\u2019s bird
p63461
aVThat lets it hop a little from his hand
p63462
aVLike a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves
p63463
aVAnd with a silken thread plucks it back again
p63464
aVSo loving-jealous of his liberty
p63465
aVI would I were thy bird
p63466
aVSweet so would I
p63467
aVYet I should kill thee with much cherishing
p63468
aVGood night good night Parting is such sweet sorrow
p63469
aVThat I shall say Good night till it be morrow
p63470
aVSleep dwell upon thine eyes peace in thy breast
p63471
aVWould I were sleep and peace so sweet to rest
p63472
aVHence will I to my ghostly friar\u2019s close cell
p63473
aVHis help to crave and my dear hap to tell
p63474
aVThe gray-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night
p63475
aVCheck\u2019ring the eastern clouds with streaks of light
p63476
aVAnd fleckled darkness like a drunkard reels
p63477
aVFrom forth day\u2019s path and Titan\u2019s fiery wheels
p63478
aVNow ere the sun advance his burning eye
p63479
aVThe day to cheer and night\u2019s dank dew to dry
p63480
aVI must upfill this osier cage of ours
p63481
aVWith baleful weeds and precious-juicèd flowers
p63482
aVThe Earth that\u2019s nature\u2019s mother is her tomb
p63483
aVWhat is her burying grave that is her womb
p63484
aVAnd from her womb children of divers kind
p63485
aVWe sucking on her natural bosom find
p63486
aVMany for many virtues excellent
p63487
aVNone but for some and yet all different
p63488
aVO mickle is the powerful grace that lies
p63489
aVIn plants herbs stones and their true qualities
p63490
aVFor naught so vile that on the Earth doth live
p63491
aVBut to the Earth some special good doth give
p63492
aVNor aught so good but strained from that fair use
p63493
aVRevolts from true birth stumbling on abuse
p63494
aVVirtue itself turns vice being misapplied
p63495
aVAnd vice sometime by action dignified
p63496
aVWithin the infant rind of this weak flower
p63497
aVPoison hath residence and medicine power
p63498
aVFor this being smelt with that part cheers each part
p63499
aVBeing tasted stays all senses with the heart
p63500
aVTwo such opposèd kings encamp them still
p63501
aVIn man as well as herbs grace and rude will
p63502
aVAnd where the worser is predominant
p63503
aVFull soon the canker death eats up that plant
p63504
aVGood morrow father
p63505
aVBenedicite
p63506
aVWhat early tongue so sweet saluteth me
p63507
aVYoung son it argues a distempered head
p63508
aVSo soon to bid Good morrow to thy bed
p63509
aVCare keeps his watch in every old man\u2019s eye
p63510
aVAnd where care lodges sleep will never lie
p63511
aVBut where unbruisèd youth with unstuffed brain
p63512
aVDoth couch his limbs there golden sleep doth reign
p63513
aVTherefore thy earliness doth me assure
p63514
aVThou art uproused with some distemp\u2019rature
p63515
aVOr if not so then here I hit it right
p63516
aVOur Romeo hath not been in bed tonight
p63517
aVThat last is true The sweeter rest was mine
p63518
aVGod pardon sin Wast thou with Rosaline
p63519
aVWith Rosaline my ghostly father No
p63520
aVI have forgot that name and that name\u2019s woe
p63521
aVThat\u2019s my good son But where hast thou been then
p63522
aVI\u2019ll tell thee ere thou ask it me again
p63523
aVI have been feasting with mine enemy
p63524
aVWhere on a sudden one hath wounded me
p63525
aVThat\u2019s by me wounded Both our remedies
p63526
aVWithin thy help and holy physic lies
p63527
aVI bear no hatred blessèd man for lo
p63528
aVMy intercession likewise steads my foe
p63529
aVBe plain good son and homely in thy drift
p63530
aVRiddling confession finds but riddling shrift
p63531
aVThen plainly know my heart\u2019s dear love is set
p63532
aVOn the fair daughter of rich Capulet
p63533
aVAs mine on hers so hers is set on mine
p63534
aVAnd all combined save what thou must combine
p63535
aVBy holy marriage When and where and how
p63536
aVWe met we wooed and made exchange of vow
p63537
aVI\u2019ll tell thee as we pass but this I pray
p63538
aVThat thou consent to marry us today
p63539
aVHoly Saint Francis what a change is here
p63540
aVIs Rosaline that thou didst love so dear
p63541
aVSo soon forsaken Young men\u2019s love then lies
p63542
aVNot truly in their hearts but in their eyes
p63543
aVJesu Maria what a deal of brine
p63544
aVHath washed thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline
p63545
aVHow much salt water thrown away in waste
p63546
aVTo season love that of it doth not taste
p63547
aVThe sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears
p63548
aVThy old groans yet ringing in mine ancient ears
p63549
aVLo here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
p63550
aVOf an old tear that is not washed off yet
p63551
aVIf e\u2019er thou wast thyself and these woes thine
p63552
aVThou and these woes were all for Rosaline
p63553
aVAnd art thou changed Pronounce this sentence then
p63554
aVWomen may fall when there\u2019s no strength in men
p63555
aVThou chid\u2019st me oft for loving Rosaline
p63556
aVFor doting not for loving pupil mine
p63557
aVAnd bad\u2019st me bury love
p63558
aVNot in a grave
p63559
aVTo lay one in another out to have
p63560
aVI pray thee chide me not Her I love now
p63561
aVDoth grace for grace and love for love allow
p63562
aVThe other did not so
p63563
aVO she knew well
p63564
aVThy love did read by rote that could not spell
p63565
aVBut come young waverer come go with me
p63566
aVIn one respect I\u2019ll thy assistant be
p63567
aVFor this alliance may so happy prove
p63568
aVTo turn your households\u2019 rancor to pure love
p63569
aVO let us hence I stand on sudden haste
p63570
aVWisely and slow They stumble that run fast
p63571
aVWhere the devil should this Romeo be
p63572
aVCame he not home tonight
p63573
aVNot to his father\u2019s I spoke with his man
p63574
aVWhy that same pale hard-hearted wench that Rosaline
p63575
aVTorments him so that he will sure run mad
p63576
aVTybalt the kinsman to old Capulet
p63577
aVHath sent a letter to his father\u2019s house
p63578
aVAn old hare hoar
p63579
aVAnd an old hare hoar
p63580
aVIs very good meat in Lent
p63581
aVBut a hare that is hoar
p63582
aVIs too much for a score
p63583
aVWhen it hoars ere it be spent
p63584
aVBid her devise
p63585
aVSome means to come to shrift this afternoon
p63586
aVAnd there she shall at Friar Lawrence\u2019 cell
p63587
aVBe shrived and married Here is for thy pains
p63588
aVThis afternoon sir Well she shall be there
p63589
aVAnd stay good nurse behind the abbey wall
p63590
aVWithin this hour my man shall be with thee
p63591
aVAnd bring thee cords made like a tackled stair
p63592
aVWhich to the high topgallant of my joy

aVThe clock struck nine when I did send the Nurse
p63602
aVIn half an hour she promised to return

aVPerchance she cannot meet him That\u2019s not so
p63604

p63605
aVWhich ten times faster glides than the sun\u2019s beams
p63606
aVDriving back shadows over louring hills

aVTherefore do nimble-pinioned doves draw Love
p63608
aVAnd therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings
p63609
aVNow is the sun upon the highmost hill
p63610
aVOf this day\u2019s journey and from nine till twelve
p63611
aVIs three long hours yet she is not come
p63612
aVHad she affections and warm youthful blood
p63613
aVShe would be as swift in motion as a ball
p63614
aVMy words would bandy her to my sweet love
p63615
aVAnd his to me
p63616
aVBut old folks many feign as they were dead
p63617
aVUnwieldy slow heavy and pale as lead
p63618
aVO God she comes O honey nurse what news

aVNow good sweet nurse O Lord why lookest thou sad
p63621
aVThough news be sad yet tell them merrily
p63622
aVIf good thou shamest the music of sweet news
p63623
aVBy playing it to me with so sour a face
p63624
aVI am aweary Give me leave awhile

aVDo you not see that I am out of breath
p63630
aVHow art thou out of breath when thou hast breath
p63631
aVTo say to me that thou art out of breath
p63632
aVThe excuse that thou dost make in this delay
p63633
aVIs longer than the tale thou dost excuse
p63634
aVIs thy news good or bad Answer to that
p63635
aVSay either and I\u2019ll stay the circumstance
p63636
aVLet me be satisfied is \u2019t good or bad

aVIt beats as it would fall in twenty pieces

aVMy back o\u2019 t\u2019 other side Ah my back my back

aVTo catch my death with jaunting up and down

aVI\u2019 faith I am sorry that thou art not well
p63645
aVSweet sweet sweet nurse tell me what says my love
p63646
aVWhere is my mother Why she is within
p63647
aVWhere should she be How oddly thou repliest
p63648
aVYour love says like an honest gentleman
p63649
aVWhere is your mother
p63650
aVO God\u2019s lady dear
p63651
aVAre you so hot Marry come up I trow
p63652
aVIs this the poultice for my aching bones
p63653
aVHenceforward do your messages yourself
p63654
aVHere\u2019s such a coil Come what says Romeo
p63655
aVHave you got leave to go to shrift today
p63656
aVThen hie you hence to Friar Lawrence\u2019 cell
p63657
aVThere stays a husband to make you a wife
p63658
aVNow comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks
p63659
aVThey\u2019ll be in scarlet straight at any news
p63660
aVHie you to church I must another way
p63661
aVTo fetch a ladder by the which your love
p63662
aVMust climb a bird\u2019s nest soon when it is dark
p63663
aVI am the drudge and toil in your delight
p63664
aVBut you shall bear the burden soon at night
p63665
aVGo I\u2019ll to dinner Hie you to the cell
p63666
aVHie to high fortune Honest nurse farewell
p63667
aVSo smile the heavens upon this holy act
p63668
aVThat after-hours with sorrow chide us not
p63669
aVAmen amen But come what sorrow can
p63670
aVIt cannot countervail the exchange of joy
p63671
aVThat one short minute gives me in her sight
p63672
aVDo thou but close our hands with holy words
p63673
aVThen love-devouring death do what he dare
p63674
aVIt is enough I may but call her mine
p63675
aVThese violent delights have violent ends
p63676
aVAnd in their triumph die like fire and powder
p63677
aVWhich as they kiss consume The sweetest honey
p63678
aVIs loathsome in his own deliciousness
p63679
aVAnd in the taste confounds the appetite
p63680
aVTherefore love moderately Long love doth so
p63681
aVToo swift arrives as tardy as too slow
p63682
aVHere comes the lady O so light a foot
p63683
aVWill ne\u2019er wear out the everlasting flint
p63684
aVA lover may bestride the gossamers
p63685
aVThat idles in the wanton summer air
p63686
aVAnd yet not fall so light is vanity
p63687
aVGood even to my ghostly confessor
p63688
aVRomeo shall thank thee daughter for us both
p63689
aVAs much to him else is his thanks too much
p63690
aVAh Juliet if the measure of thy joy
p63691
aVBe heaped like mine and that thy skill be more
p63692
aVTo blazon it then sweeten with thy breath

p64452
aVMarry I will and this is wisely done
p64453
aVAncient damnation O most wicked fiend
p64454
aVIs it more sin to wish me thus forsworn
p64455
aVOr to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
p64456
aVWhich she hath praised him with above compare
p64457
aVSo many thousand times Go counselor
p64458
aVThou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain
p64459
aVI\u2019ll to the Friar to know his remedy
p64460
aVIf all else fail myself have power to die
p64461
aVOn Thursday sir The time is very short
p64462
aVMy father Capulet will have it so
p64463
aVAnd I am nothing slow to slack his haste
p64464
aVYou say you do not know the lady\u2019s mind
p64465
aVUneven is the course I like it not
p64466
aVImmoderately she weeps for Tybalt\u2019s death
p64467
aVAnd therefore have I little talk of love
p64468
aVFor Venus smiles not in a house of tears
p64469
aVNow sir her father counts it dangerous
p64470
aVThat she do give her sorrow so much sway
p64471
aVAnd in his wisdom hastes our marriage
p64472
aVTo stop the inundation of her tears
p64473
aVWhich too much minded by herself alone
p64474
aVMay be put from her by society
p64475
aVNow do you know the reason of this haste
p64476
aVI would I knew not why it should be slowed
p64477
aVLook sir here comes the lady toward my cell
p64478
aVHappily met my lady and my wife
p64479
aVThat may be sir when I may be a wife
p64480
aVThat may be must be love on Thursday next
p64481
aVWhat must be shall be
p64482
aVThat\u2019s a certain text
p64483
aVCome you to make confession to this father
p64484
aVTo answer that I should confess to you
p64485
aVDo not deny to him that you love me
p64486
aVI will confess to you that I love him
p64487
aVSo will you I am sure that you love me
p64488
aVIf I do so it will be of more price
p64489
aVBeing spoke behind your back than to your face
p64490
aVPoor soul thy face is much abused with tears
p64491
aVThe tears have got small victory by that
p64492
aVFor it was bad enough before their spite
p64493
aVThou wrong\u2019st it more than tears with that report
p64494
aVThat is no slander sir which is a truth
p64495
aVAnd what I spake I spake it to my face
p64496
aVThy face is mine and thou hast slandered it
p64497
aVIt may be so for it is not mine own
p64498
aVAre you at leisure holy father now
p64499
aVOr shall I come to you at evening Mass
p64500
aVMy leisure serves me pensive daughter now
p64501
aVMy lord we must entreat the time alone
p64502
aVGod shield I should disturb devotion
p64503
aVJuliet on Thursday early will I rouse you
p64504
aVTill then adieu and keep this holy kiss
p64505
aVO shut the door and when thou hast done so
p64506
aVCome weep with me past hope past care past help
p64507
aVO Juliet I already know thy grief
p64508
aVIt strains me past the compass of my wits
p64509
aVI hear thou must and nothing may prorogue it
p64510
aVOn Thursday next be married to this County
p64511
aVTell me not friar that thou hearest of this
p64512
aVUnless thou tell me how I may prevent it
p64513
aVIf in thy wisdom thou canst give no help
p64514
aVDo thou but call my resolution wise
p64515
aVAnd with this knife I\u2019ll help it presently
p64516
aVGod joined my heart and Romeo\u2019s thou our hands
p64517
aVAnd ere this hand by thee to Romeo\u2019s sealed
p64518
aVShall be the label to another deed
p64519
aVOr my true heart with treacherous revolt
p64520
aVTurn to another this shall slay them both
p64521
aVTherefore out of thy long-experienced time
p64522
aVGive me some present counsel or behold
p64523
aV\u2019Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
p64524
aVShall play the umpire arbitrating that
p64525
aVWhich the commission of thy years and art
p64526
aVCould to no issue of true honor bring
p64527
aVBe not so long to speak I long to die
p64528
aVIf what thou speak\u2019st speak not of remedy
p64529
aVHold daughter I do spy a kind of hope
p64530
aVWhich craves as desperate an execution
p64531
aVAs that is desperate which we would prevent
p64532
aVIf rather than to marry County Paris
p64533
aVThou hast the strength of will to slay thyself
p64534
aVThen is it likely thou wilt undertake
p64535
aVA thing like death to chide away this shame
p64536
aVThat cop\u2019st with death himself to \u2019scape from it
p64537
aVAnd if thou darest I\u2019ll give thee remedy
p64538
aVO bid me leap rather than marry Paris
p64539
aVFrom off the battlements of any tower
p64540
aVOr walk in thievish ways or bid me lurk
p64541
aVWhere serpents are Chain me with roaring bears
p64542
aVOr hide me nightly in a charnel house
p64543
aVO\u2019ercovered quite with dead men\u2019s rattling bones
p64544
aVWith reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls
p64545
aVOr bid me go into a new-made grave
p64546
aVAnd hide me with a dead man in his shroud
p64547
aVThings that to hear them told have made me tremble
p64548
aVAnd I will do it without fear or doubt
p64549
aVTo live an unstained wife to my sweet love
p64550
aVHold then Go home be merry give consent
p64551
aVTo marry Paris Wednesday is tomorrow
p64552
aVTomorrow night look that thou lie alone
p64553
aVLet not the Nurse lie with thee in thy chamber
p64554
aVTake thou this vial being then in bed
p64555
aVAnd this distilling liquor drink thou off
p64556
aVWhen presently through all thy veins shall run
p64557
aVA cold and drowsy humor for no pulse
p64558
aVShall keep his native progress but surcease
p64559
aVNo warmth no breath shall testify thou livest
p64560
aVThe roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
p64561
aVTo paly ashes thy eyes\u2019 windows fall
p64562
aVLike death when he shuts up the day of life
p64563
aVEach part deprived of supple government
p64564
aVShall stiff and stark and cold appear like death
p64565
aVAnd in this borrowed likeness of shrunk death
p64566
aVThou shalt continue two and forty hours
p64567
aVAnd then awake as from a pleasant sleep
p64568
aVNow when the bridegroom in the morning comes
p64569
aVTo rouse thee from thy bed there art thou dead
p64570
aVThen as the manner of our country is
p64571
aVIn thy best robes uncovered on the bier
p64572
aVThou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
p64573
aVWhere all the kindred of the Capulets lie
p64574
aVIn the meantime against thou shalt awake
p64575
aVShall Romeo by my letters know our drift
p64576
aVAnd hither shall he come and he and I
p64577
aVWill watch thy waking and that very night
p64578
aVShall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua
p64579
aVAnd this shall free thee from this present shame
p64580
aVIf no inconstant toy nor womanish fear
p64581
aVAbate thy valor in the acting it
p64582
aVGive me give me O tell not me of fear
p64583
aVHold get you gone Be strong and prosperous
p64584
aVIn this resolve I\u2019ll send a friar with speed

p64655
aVBecause he married me before to Romeo
p64656
aVI fear it is And yet methinks it should not
p64657
aVFor he hath still been tried a holy man
p64658
aVHow if when I am laid into the tomb
p64659
aVI wake before the time that Romeo
p64660
aVCome to redeem me There\u2019s a fearful point
p64661
aVShall I not then be stifled in the vault
p64662
aVTo whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in
p64663
aVAnd there die strangled ere my Romeo comes
p64664
aVOr if I live is it not very like
p64665
aVThe horrible conceit of death and night
p64666
aVTogether with the terror of the place
p64667
aVAs in a vault an ancient receptacle
p64668
aVWhere for this many hundred years the bones
p64669
aVOf all my buried ancestors are packed
p64670
aVWhere bloody Tybalt yet but green in earth
p64671
aVLies fest\u2019ring in his shroud where as they say
p64672
aVAt some hours in the night spirits resort
p64673
aVAlack alack is it not like that I
p64674
aVSo early waking what with loathsome smells
p64675
aVAnd shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth
p64676
aVThat living mortals hearing them run mad
p64677
aVO if I wake shall I not be distraught
p64678
aVEnvironèd with all these hideous fears
p64679
aVAnd madly play with my forefathers\u2019 joints
p64680
aVAnd pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud
p64681
aVAnd in this rage with some great kinsman\u2019s bone
p64682
aVAs with a club dash out my desp\u2019rate brains
p64683
aVO look methinks I see my cousin\u2019s ghost

aVHow doth my Juliet That I ask again
p64840
aVFor nothing can be ill if she be well
p64841
aVThen she is well and nothing can be ill
p64842
aVHer body sleeps in Capels\u2019 monument
p64843
aVAnd her immortal part with angels lives
p64844
aVI saw her laid low in her kindred\u2019s vault
p64845
aVAnd presently took post to tell it you
p64846
aVO pardon me for bringing these ill news
p64847
aVSince you did leave it for my office sir

p64860
aVWell Juliet I will lie with thee tonight
p64861
aVLet\u2019s see for means O mischief thou art swift
p64862
aVTo enter in the thoughts of desperate men
p64863
aVI do remember an apothecary
p64864
aVAnd hereabouts he dwells which late I noted
p64865
aVIn tattered weeds with overwhelming brows
p64866
aVCulling of simples Meager were his looks
p64867
aVSharp misery had worn him to the bones
p64868
aVAnd in his needy shop a tortoise hung
p64869
aVAn alligator stuffed and other skins
p64870
aVOf ill-shaped fishes and about his shelves
p64871
aVA beggarly account of empty boxes
p64872
aVGreen earthen pots bladders and musty seeds
p64873
aVRemnants of packthread and old cakes of roses
p64874
aVWere thinly scattered to make up a show
p64875
aVNoting this penury to myself I said
p64876
aVAn if a man did need a poison now
p64877
aVWhose sale is present death in Mantua
p64878
aVHere lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him
p64879
aVO this same thought did but forerun my need
p64880
aVAnd this same needy man must sell it me
p64881
aVAs I remember this should be the house
p64882
aVBeing holiday the beggar\u2019s shop is shut
p64883
aVWhat ho Apothecary
p64884
aVWho calls so loud
p64885
aVCome hither man I see that thou art poor
p64886
aVHold there is forty ducats Let me have
p64887
aVA dram of poison such soon-speeding gear
p64888
aVAs will disperse itself through all the veins
p64889
aVThat the life-weary taker may fall dead
p64890
aVAnd that the trunk may be discharged of breath
p64891
aVAs violently as hasty powder fired
p64892
aVDoth hurry from the fatal cannon\u2019s womb
p64893
aVSuch mortal drugs I have but Mantua\u2019s law
p64894
aVIs death to any he that utters them
p64895
aVArt thou so bare and full of wretchedness
p64896
aVAnd fearest to die Famine is in thy cheeks
p64897
aVNeed and oppression starveth in thy eyes

aVContempt and beggary hangs upon thy back
p64899
aVThe world is not thy friend nor the world\u2019s law
p64900
aVThe world affords no law to make thee rich

p64906
aVOf twenty men it would dispatch you straight
p64907
aVThere is thy gold worse poison to men\u2019s souls
p64908
aVDoing more murder in this loathsome world
p64909
aVThan these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell
p64910
aVI sell thee poison thou hast sold me none
p64911
aVFarewell buy food and get thyself in flesh
p64912
aVCome cordial and not poison go with me
p64913
aVTo Juliet\u2019s grave for there must I use thee
p64914
aVHoly Franciscan friar brother ho
p64915
aVThis same should be the voice of Friar John
p64916
aVWelcome from Mantua What says Romeo
p64917
aVOr if his mind be writ give me his letter
p64918
aVGoing to find a barefoot brother out
p64919
aVOne of our order to associate me
p64920
aVHere in this city visiting the sick
p64921
aVAnd finding him the searchers of the town
p64922
aVSuspecting that we both were in a house
p64923
aVWhere the infectious pestilence did reign
p64924
aVSealed up the doors and would not let us forth
p64925
aVSo that my speed to Mantua there was stayed
p64926
aVWho bare my letter then to Romeo
p64927
aVI could not send it here it is again
p64928
aVNor get a messenger to bring it thee
p64929
aVSo fearful were they of infection
p64930
aVUnhappy fortune By my brotherhood
p64931
aVThe letter was not nice but full of charge
p64932
aVOf dear import and the neglecting it
p64933
aVMay do much danger Friar John go hence
p64934
aVGet me an iron crow and bring it straight
p64935
aVUnto my cell
p64936
aVBrother I\u2019ll go and bring it thee
p64937
aVNow must I to the monument alone
p64938
aVWithin this three hours will fair Juliet wake
p64939
aVShe will beshrew me much that Romeo
p64940
aVHath had no notice of these accidents
p64941
aVBut I will write again to Mantua
p64942
aVAnd keep her at my cell till Romeo come
p64943
aVPoor living corse closed in a dead man\u2019s tomb
p64944
aVGive me thy torch boy Hence and stand aloof
p64945
aVYet put it out for I would not be seen
p64946
aVUnder yond yew trees lay thee all along
p64947
aVHolding thy ear close to the hollow ground
p64948
aVSo shall no foot upon the churchyard tread
p64949
aVBeing loose unfirm with digging up of graves
p64950
aVBut thou shalt hear it Whistle then to me
p64951
aVAs signal that thou hearest something approach

p64969
aVWhate\u2019er thou hearest or seest stand all aloof
p64970
aVAnd do not interrupt me in my course
p64971
aVWhy I descend into this bed of death
p64972
aVIs partly to behold my lady\u2019s face
p64973
aVBut chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
p64974
aVA precious ring a ring that I must use
p64975
aVIn dear employment Therefore hence begone
p64976
aVBut if thou jealous dost return to pry

aVIn what I farther shall intend to do
p64978
aVBy heaven I will tear thee joint by joint
p64979
aVAnd strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs
p64980
aVThe time and my intents are savage-wild
p64981
aVMore fierce and more inexorable far
p64982
aVThan empty tigers or the roaring sea
p64983
aVI will be gone sir and not trouble you
p64984
aVSo shalt thou show me friendship Take thou that
p64985
aVLive and be prosperous and farewell good fellow
p64986
aVFor all this same I\u2019ll hide me hereabout

p64988
aVThou detestable maw thou womb of death
p64989
aVGorged with the dearest morsel of the earth
p64990
aVThus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open
p64991
aVAnd in despite I\u2019ll cram thee with more food
p64992
aVThis is that banished haughty Montague
p64993
aVThat murdered my love\u2019s cousin with which grief
p64994
aVIt is supposèd the fair creature died
p64995
aVAnd here is come to do some villainous shame
p64996
aVTo the dead bodies I will apprehend him

aVHe told me Paris should have married Juliet

p65175
aVThen say at once what thou dost know in this
p65176
aVI will be brief for my short date of breath
p65177
aVIs not so long as is a tedious tale
p65178
aVRomeo there dead was husband to that Juliet
p65179
aVAnd she there dead that Romeo\u2019s faithful wife
p65180
aVI married them and their stol\u2019n marriage day
p65181
aVWas Tybalt\u2019s doomsday whose untimely death
p65182
aVBanished the new-made bridegroom from this city
p65183
aVFor whom and not for Tybalt Juliet pined
p65184
aVYou to remove that siege of grief from her
p65185
aVBetrothed and would have married her perforce
p65186
aVTo County Paris Then comes she to me
p65187
aVAnd with wild looks bid me devise some mean
p65188
aVTo rid her from this second marriage
p65189
aVOr in my cell there would she kill herself
p65190
aVThen gave I her so tutored by my art
p65191
aVA sleeping potion which so took effect
p65192
aVAs I intended for it wrought on her
p65193
aVThe form of death Meantime I writ to Romeo
p65194
aVThat he should hither come as this dire night
p65195
aVTo help to take her from her borrowed grave
p65196
aVBeing the time the potion\u2019s force should cease
p65197
aVBut he which bore my letter Friar John
p65198
aVWas stayed by accident and yesternight
p65199
aVReturned my letter back Then all alone
p65200
aVAt the prefixèd hour of her waking
p65201
aVCame I to take her from her kindred\u2019s vault
p65202
aVMeaning to keep her closely at my cell
p65203
aVTill I conveniently could send to Romeo
p65204
aVBut when I came some minute ere the time
p65205
aVOf her awakening here untimely lay
p65206
aVThe noble Paris and true Romeo dead
p65207
aVShe wakes and I entreated her come forth
p65208
aVAnd bear this work of heaven with patience
p65209
aVBut then a noise did scare me from the tomb
p65210
aVAnd she too desperate would not go with me
p65211
aVBut as it seems did violence on herself
p65212
aVAll this I know and to the marriage
p65213
aVHer nurse is privy And if aught in this
p65214
aVMiscarried by my fault let my old life
p65215
aVBe sacrificed some hour before his time
p65216
aVUnto the rigor of severest law
p65217
aVWe still have known thee for a holy man
p65218
aVWhere\u2019s Romeo\u2019s man What can he say to this
p65219
aVI brought my master news of Juliet\u2019s death
p65220
aVAnd then in post he came from Mantua
p65221
aVTo this same place to this same monument
p65222
aVThis letter he early bid me give his father
p65223
aVAnd threatened me with death going in the vault
p65224
aVIf I departed not and left him there
p65225
aVGive me the letter I will look on it
p65226
aVWhere is the County\u2019s page that raised the watch
p65227
aVSirrah what made your master in this place
p65228
aVHe came with flowers to strew his lady\u2019s grave
p65229
aVAnd bid me stand aloof and so I did
p65230
aVAnon comes one with light to ope the tomb
p65231
aVAnd by and by my master drew on him
p65232
aVAnd then I ran away to call the watch
p65233
aVThis letter doth make good the Friar\u2019s words
p65234
aVTheir course of love the tidings of her death
p65235
aVAnd here he writes that he did buy a poison
p65236
aVOf a poor \u2019pothecary and therewithal
p65237
aVCame to this vault to die and lie with Juliet
p65238
aVWhere be these enemies Capulet Montague
p65239
aVSee what a scourge is laid upon your hate
p65240
aVThat heaven finds means to kill your joys with love
p65241
aVAnd I for winking at your discords too
p65242
aVHave lost a brace of kinsmen All are punished
p65243
aVO brother Montague give me thy hand
p65244
aVThis is my daughter\u2019s jointure for no more
p65245
aVCan I demand
p65246
aVBut I can give thee more
p65247
aVFor I will ray her statue in pure gold
p65248
aVThat whiles Verona by that name is known
p65249
aVThere shall no figure at such rate be set
p65250
aVAs that of true and faithful Juliet
p65251
aVAs rich shall Romeo\u2019s by his lady\u2019s lie
p65252
aVPoor sacrifices of our enmity
p65253
aVA glooming peace this morning with it brings
p65254
aVThe sun for sorrow will not show his head
p65255
aVGo hence to have more talk of these sad things
p65256
aVSome shall be pardoned and some punishèd
p65257
aVFor never was a story of more woe
p65258
aVThan this of Juliet and her Romeo
p65259
aVHuntsman I charge thee tender well my hounds
p65260
aVBreathe Merriman the poor cur is embossed
p65261
aVAnd couple Clowder with the deep-mouthed brach
p65262
aVSaw\u2019st thou not boy how Silver made it good
p65263
aVAt the hedge corner in the coldest fault
p65264
aVI would not lose the dog for twenty pound
p65265
aVWhy Bellman is as good as he my lord
p65266
aVHe cried upon it at the merest loss
p65267
aVAnd twice today picked out the dullest scent
p65268
aVTrust me I take him for the better dog
p65269
aVThou art a fool If Echo were as fleet
p65270
aVI would esteem him worth a dozen such
p65271
aVBut sup them well and look unto them all
p65272
aVTomorrow I intend to hunt again
p65273
aVWhat\u2019s here One dead or drunk See doth he breathe
p65274
aVHe breathes my lord Were he not warmed with ale
p65275
aVThis were a bed but cold to sleep so soundly
p65276
aVO monstrous beast how like a swine he lies
p65277
aVGrim death how foul and loathsome is thine image
p65278
aVSirs I will practice on this drunken man

aVWhat think you if he were conveyed to bed
p65280
aVWrapped in sweet clothes rings put upon his fingers
p65281
aVA most delicious banquet by his bed
p65282
aVAnd brave attendants near him when he wakes
p65283
aVWould not the beggar then forget himself
p65284
aVBelieve me lord I think he cannot choose
p65285
aVIt would seem strange unto him when he waked
p65286
aVEven as a flatt\u2019ring dream or worthless fancy
p65287
aVThen take him up and manage well the jest
p65288
aVCarry him gently to my fairest chamber
p65289
aVAnd hang it round with all my wanton pictures
p65290
aVBalm his foul head in warm distillèd waters
p65291
aVAnd burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet
p65292
aVProcure me music ready when he wakes
p65293
aVTo make a dulcet and a heavenly sound
p65294
aVAnd if he chance to speak be ready straight
p65295
aVAnd with a low submissive reverence
p65296
aVSay What is it your Honor will command
p65297
aVLet one attend him with a silver basin
p65298
aVFull of rosewater and bestrewed with flowers
p65299
aVAnother bear the ewer the third a diaper
p65300
aVAnd say Will \u2019t please your Lordship cool your hands
p65301
aVSomeone be ready with a costly suit
p65302
aVAnd ask him what apparel he will wear
p65303
aVAnother tell him of his hounds and horse
p65304
aVAnd that his lady mourns at his disease
p65305
aVPersuade him that he hath been lunatic
p65306
aVAnd when he says he is say that he dreams
p65307
aVFor he is nothing but a mighty lord
p65308
aVThis do and do it kindly gentle sirs
p65309
aVIt will be pastime passing excellent
p65310
aVIf it be husbanded with modesty
p65311
aVMy lord I warrant you we will play our part
p65312
aVAs he shall think by our true diligence
p65313
aVHe is no less than what we say he is
p65314
aVTake him up gently and to bed with him
p65315
aVAnd each one to his office when he wakes
p65316
aVSirrah go see what trumpet \u2019tis that sounds
p65317
aVBelike some noble gentleman that means

aVSo please your Lordship to accept our duty

aVWith all my heart This fellow I remember
p65327
aVSince once he played a farmer\u2019s eldest son
p65328
aV\u2019Twas where you wooed the gentlewoman so well
p65329
aVI have forgot your name but sure that part
p65330
aVWas aptly fitted and naturally performed
p65331
aVI think \u2019twas Soto that your Honor means
p65332
aV\u2019Tis very true Thou didst it excellent
p65333
aVWell you are come to me in happy time
p65334
aVThe rather for I have some sport in hand
p65335
aVWherein your cunning can assist me much
p65336
aVThere is a lord will hear you play tonight
p65337
aVBut I am doubtful of your modesties
p65338
aVLest over-eying of his odd behavior
p65339
aVFor yet his Honor never heard a play
p65340
aVYou break into some merry passion
p65341
aVAnd so offend him For I tell you sirs
p65342
aVIf you should smile he grows impatient
p65343
aVFear not my lord we can contain ourselves
p65344
aVWere he the veriest antic in the world
p65345
aVGo sirrah take them to the buttery

p65351
aVAnd call him Madam do him obeisance
p65352
aVTell him from me as he will win my love
p65353
aVHe bear himself with honorable action
p65354
aVSuch as he hath observed in noble ladies
p65355
aVUnto their lords by them accomplishèd
p65356
aVSuch duty to the drunkard let him do
p65357
aVWith soft low tongue and lowly courtesy
p65358
aVAnd say What is \u2019t your Honor will command
p65359
aVWherein your lady and your humble wife
p65360
aVMay show her duty and make known her love
p65361
aVAnd then with kind embracements tempting kisses
p65362
aVAnd with declining head into his bosom
p65363
aVBid him shed tears as being overjoyed
p65364
aVTo see her noble lord restored to health
p65365
aVWho for this seven years hath esteemed him
p65366
aVNo better than a poor and loathsome beggar
p65367
aVAnd if the boy have not a woman\u2019s gift
p65368
aVTo rain a shower of commanded tears
p65369
aVAn onion will do well for such a shift
p65370
aVWhich in a napkin being close conveyed
p65371
aVShall in despite enforce a watery eye
p65372
aVSee this dispatched with all the haste thou canst
p65373
aVAnon I\u2019ll give thee more instructions

aVI know the boy will well usurp the grace
p65375
aVVoice gait and action of a gentlewoman

aVAnd how my men will stay themselves from laughter
p65378
aVWhen they do homage to this simple peasant
p65379
aVI\u2019ll in to counsel them Haply my presence
p65380
aVMay well abate the over-merry spleen
p65381
aVWhich otherwise would grow into extremes

aVWill \u2019t please your Lord drink a cup of sack
p65383
aVWill \u2019t please your Honor taste of these conserves
p65384
aVWhat raiment will your Honor wear today
p65385
aVHeaven cease this idle humor in your Honor
p65386
aVO that a mighty man of such descent
p65387
aVOf such possessions and so high esteem
p65388
aVShould be infusèd with so foul a spirit
p65389
aVO this it is that makes your lady mourn
p65390
aVO this is it that makes your servants droop
p65391
aVHence comes it that your kindred shuns your house
p65392
aVAs beaten hence by your strange lunacy

p65416
aVEven as the waving sedges play with wind
p65417
aVWe\u2019ll show thee Io as she was a maid
p65418
aVAnd how she was beguilèd and surprised
p65419
aVAs lively painted as the deed was done
p65420
aVOr Daphne roaming through a thorny wood
p65421
aVScratching her legs that one shall swear she bleeds
p65422
aVAnd at that sight shall sad Apollo weep
p65423
aVSo workmanly the blood and tears are drawn
p65424
aVThou art a lord and nothing but a lord
p65425
aVThou hast a lady far more beautiful
p65426
aVThan any woman in this waning age
p65427
aVAnd till the tears that she hath shed for thee
p65428
aVLike envious floods o\u2019errun her lovely face
p65429
aVShe was the fairest creature in the world
p65430
aVAnd yet she is inferior to none
p65431
aVAm I a lord and have I such a lady
p65432
aVOr do I dream Or have I dreamed till now
p65433
aVI do not sleep I see I hear I speak
p65434
aVI smell sweet savors and I feel soft things
p65435
aVUpon my life I am a lord indeed
p65436
aVAnd not a tinker nor Christopher Sly
p65437
aVWell bring our lady hither to our sight
p65438
aVAnd once again a pot o\u2019 the smallest ale
p65439
aVWill \u2019t please your Mightiness to wash your hands
p65440
aVO how we joy to see your wit restored
p65441
aVO that once more you knew but what you are
p65442
aVThese fifteen years you have been in a dream
p65443
aVOr when you waked so waked as if you slept
p65444
aVThese fifteen years By my fay a goodly nap
p65445
aVBut did I never speak of all that time
p65446
aVOh yes my lord but very idle words
p65447
aVFor though you lay here in this goodly chamber
p65448
aVYet would you say you were beaten out of door
p65449
aVAnd rail upon the hostess of the house
p65450
aVAnd say you would present her at the leet
p65451
aVBecause she brought stone jugs and no sealed quarts
p65452
aVSometimes you would call out for Cicely Hacket
p65453
aVWhy sir you know no house nor no such maid
p65454
aVNor no such men as you have reckoned up
p65455
aVAs Stephen Sly and old John Naps of Greete
p65456
aVAnd Peter Turph and Henry Pimpernell
p65457
aVAnd twenty more such names and men as these
p65458
aVWhich never were nor no man ever saw
p65459
aVHere noble lord What is thy will with her
p65460
aVAre you my wife and will not call me husband
p65461
aVMy men should call me lord I am your goodman
p65462
aVMy husband and my lord my lord and husband
p65463
aVI am your wife in all obedience
p65464
aVI know it well What must I call her
p65465
aVMadam
p65466
aVMadam and nothing else So lords call ladies
p65467
aVMadam wife they say that I have dreamed
p65468
aVAnd slept above some fifteen year or more
p65469
aVAy and the time seems thirty unto me
p65470
aVBeing all this time abandoned from your bed
p65471
aV\u2019Tis much Servants leave me and her alone
p65472
aVMadam undress you and come now to bed
p65473
aVThrice noble lord let me entreat of you
p65474
aVTo pardon me yet for a night or two
p65475
aVOr if not so until the sun be set
p65476
aVFor your physicians have expressly charged
p65477
aVIn peril to incur your former malady
p65478
aVThat I should yet absent me from your bed
p65479
aVI hope this reason stands for my excuse
p65480
aVYour Honor\u2019s players hearing your amendment
p65481
aVAre come to play a pleasant comedy
p65482
aVFor so your doctors hold it very meet
p65483
aVSeeing too much sadness hath congealed your blood
p65484
aVAnd melancholy is the nurse of frenzy
p65485
aVTherefore they thought it good you hear a play
p65486
aVAnd frame your mind to mirth and merriment
p65487
aVWhich bars a thousand harms and lengthens life
p65488
aVNo my good lord it is more pleasing stuff
p65489
aVTranio since for the great desire I had
p65490
aVTo see fair Padua nursery of arts
p65491
aVI am arrived for fruitful Lombardy
p65492
aVThe pleasant garden of great Italy
p65493
aVAnd by my father\u2019s love and leave am armed
p65494
aVWith his goodwill and thy good company
p65495
aVMy trusty servant well approved in all
p65496
aVHere let us breathe and haply institute
p65497
aVA course of learning and ingenious studies
p65498
aVPisa renownèd for grave citizens

p65503
aVIt shall become to serve all hopes conceived
p65504

p65505
aVAnd therefore Tranio for the time I study
p65506
aVVirtue and that part of philosophy
p65507
aVWill I apply that treats of happiness
p65508
aVBy virtue specially to be achieved
p65509
aVTell me thy mind for I have Pisa left
p65510
aVAnd am to Padua come as he that leaves
p65511
aVA shallow plash to plunge him in the deep
p65512
aVAnd with satiety seeks to quench his thirst
p65513
aVMi perdonato gentle master mine
p65514
aVI am in all affected as yourself
p65515
aVGlad that you thus continue your resolve
p65516
aVTo suck the sweets of sweet philosophy
p65517
aVOnly good master while we do admire
p65518
aVThis virtue and this moral discipline
p65519
aVLet\u2019s be no stoics nor no stocks I pray
p65520
aVOr so devote to Aristotle\u2019s checks
p65521
aVAs Ovid be an outcast quite abjured
p65522
aVBalk logic with acquaintance that you have
p65523
aVAnd practice rhetoric in your common talk
p65524
aVMusic and poesy use to quicken you
p65525
aVThe mathematics and the metaphysics
p65526
aVFall to them as you find your stomach serves you
p65527
aVNo profit grows where is no pleasure ta\u2019en

aVGramercies Tranio well dost thou advise

aVBe she as foul as was Florentius\u2019 love
p65741

aVWith wealth enough and young and beauteous
p65752
aVBrought up as best becomes a gentlewoman
p65753
aVHer only fault and that is faults enough
p65754
aVIs that she is intolerable curst

aVAnd shrewd and froward so beyond all measure
p65756
aVThat were my state far worser than it is
p65757
aVI would not wed her for a mine of gold

aVTo give you over at this first encounter
p65771
aVUnless you will accompany me thither

aVAnd her withholds from me and other more

aVSupposing it a thing impossible
p65779
aVFor those defects I have before rehearsed

aVAnd offer me disguised in sober robes
p65788
aVTo old Baptista as a schoolmaster
p65789
aVWell seen in music to instruct Bianca
p65790
aVThat so I may by this device at least
p65791
aVHave leave and leisure to make love to her
p65792
aVAnd unsuspected court her by herself
p65793
aVPeace Grumio it is the rival of my love

p65807

p66036
aVYou knew my father well and in him me

aVLeft solely heir to all his lands and goods
p66038
aVWhich I have bettered rather than decreased
p66039
aVThen tell me if I get your daughter\u2019s love
p66040

aVLet specialties be therefore drawn between us
p66047
aVThat covenants may be kept on either hand
p66048
aVAy when the special thing is well obtained
p66049
aVThat is her love for that is all in all
p66050
aVWhy that is nothing For I tell you father
p66051
aVI am as peremptory as she proud-minded
p66052
aVAnd where two raging fires meet together
p66053
aVThey do consume the thing that feeds their fury
p66054
aVThough little fire grows great with little wind
p66055
aVYet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all
p66056
aVSo I to her and so she yields to me
p66057
aVFor I am rough and woo not like a babe
p66058
aVWell mayst thou woo and happy be thy speed
p66059
aVBut be thou armed for some unhappy words
p66060
aVAy to the proof as mountains are for winds
p66061
aVThat shakes not though they blow perpetually
p66062
aVHow now my friend why dost thou look so pale
p66063
aVFor fear I promise you if I look pale
p66064
aVWhat will my daughter prove a good musician
p66065
aVI think she\u2019ll sooner prove a soldier
p66066
aVIron may hold with her but never lutes
p66067
aVWhy then thou canst not break her to the lute
p66068
aVWhy no for she hath broke the lute to me
p66069
aVI did but tell her she mistook her frets
p66070
aVAnd bowed her hand to teach her fingering
p66071
aVWhen with a most impatient devilish spirit
p66072
aVFrets call you these quoth she I\u2019ll fume with them
p66073
aVAnd with that word she struck me on the head
p66074
aVAnd through the instrument my pate made way
p66075
aVAnd there I stood amazèd for a while
p66076
aVAs on a pillory looking through the lute
p66077
aVWhile she did call me rascal fiddler
p66078
aVAnd twangling Jack with twenty such vile terms
p66079
aVAs had she studied to misuse me so
p66080
aVNow by the world it is a lusty wench
p66081
aVI love her ten times more than ere I did
p66082
aVO how I long to have some chat with her
p66083
aVWell go with me and be not so discomfited
p66084
aVProceed in practice with my younger daughter
p66085

p66086
aVSignior Petruchio will you go with us
p66087
aVOr shall I send my daughter Kate to you
p66088
aVI pray you do I\u2019ll attend her here
p66089
aVAnd woo her with some spirit when she comes
p66090
aVSay that she rail why then I\u2019ll tell her plain
p66091
aVShe sings as sweetly as a nightingale
p66092
aVSay that she frown I\u2019ll say she looks as clear
p66093
aVAs morning roses newly washed with dew
p66094
aVSay she be mute and will not speak a word
p66095
aVThen I\u2019ll commend her volubility
p66096
aVAnd say she uttereth piercing eloquence
p66097
aVIf she do bid me pack I\u2019ll give her thanks
p66098
aVAs though she bid me stay by her a week
p66099
aVIf she deny to wed I\u2019ll crave the day
p66100
aVWhen I shall ask the banns and when be marrièd
p66101
aVBut here she comes and now Petruchio speak
p66102
aVGood morrow Kate for that\u2019s your name I hear

aVThou canst not frown thou canst not look askance
p66168
aVNor bite the lip as angry wenches will
p66169
aVNor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk
p66170
aVBut thou with mildness entertain\u2019st thy wooers

aVO be thou Dian and let her be Kate
p66181
aVAnd then let Kate be chaste and Dian sportful
p66182
aVWhere did you study all this goodly speech
p66183
aVIt is extempore from my mother wit
p66184
aVA witty mother witless else her son
p66185
aVMarry so I mean sweet Katherine in thy bed
p66186
aVAnd therefore setting all this chat aside

p66206
aVA madcap ruffian and a swearing Jack
p66207
aVThat thinks with oaths to face the matter out
p66208
aVFather \u2019tis thus yourself and all the world
p66209
aVThat talked of her have talked amiss of her
p66210
aVIf she be curst it is for policy
p66211
aVFor she\u2019s not froward but modest as the dove
p66212
aVShe is not hot but temperate as the morn
p66213
aVFor patience she will prove a second Grissel
p66214

aVShe hung about my neck and kiss on kiss
p66225
aVShe vied so fast protesting oath on oath
p66226
aVThat in a twink she won me to her love
p66227
aVO you are novices \u2019Tis a world to see
p66228
aVHow tame when men and women are alone
p66229

aVTo want the bridegroom when the priest attends
p66410
aVTo speak the ceremonial rites of marriage
p66411
aVWhat says Lucentio to this shame of ours
p66412
aVNo shame but mine I must forsooth be forced
p66413
aVTo give my hand opposed against my heart
p66414
aVUnto a mad-brain rudesby full of spleen

aVWhen he stands where I am and sees you there
p66439

p66533
aVAnd seemed to ask him sops as he was drinking
p66534
aVThis done he took the bride about the neck
p66535
aVAnd kissed her lips with such a clamorous smack

p66654
aVWhat dogs are these Where is the rascal cook

p66661
aVThe meat was well if you were so contented
p66662
aVI tell thee Kate \u2019twas burnt and dried away
p66663
aVAnd I expressly am forbid to touch it
p66664
aVFor it engenders choler planteth anger
p66665
aVAnd better \u2019twere that both of us did fast
p66666
aVSince of ourselves ourselves are choleric
p66667
aVThan feed it with such over-roasted flesh
p66668
aVBe patient Tomorrow \u2019t shall be mended
p66669
aVAnd for this night we\u2019ll fast for company
p66670
aVCome I will bring thee to thy bridal chamber
p66671
aVIn her chamber
p66672
aVMaking a sermon of continency to her
p66673
aVAnd rails and swears and rates that she poor soul
p66674
aVKnows not which way to stand to look to speak
p66675
aVAnd sits as one new-risen from a dream
p66676
aVAway away for he is coming hither
p66677
aVThus have I politicly begun my reign
p66678
aVAnd \u2019tis my hope to end successfully
p66679
aVMy falcon now is sharp and passing empty
p66680
aVAnd till she stoop she must not be full-gorged
p66681
aVFor then she never looks upon her lure
p66682
aVAnother way I have to man my haggard
p66683
aVTo make her come and know her keeper\u2019s call
p66684
aVThat is to watch her as we watch these kites
p66685
aVThat bate and beat and will not be obedient
p66686
aVShe ate no meat today nor none shall eat
p66687
aVLast night she slept not nor tonight she shall not
p66688
aVAs with the meat some undeservèd fault
p66689
aVI\u2019ll find about the making of the bed
p66690
aVAnd here I\u2019ll fling the pillow there the bolster
p66691
aVThis way the coverlet another way the sheets
p66692
aVAy and amid this hurly I intend
p66693
aVThat all is done in reverend care of her
p66694
aVAnd in conclusion she shall watch all night
p66695
aVAnd if she chance to nod I\u2019ll rail and brawl
p66696
aVAnd with the clamor keep her still awake
p66697
aVThis is a way to kill a wife with kindness
p66698
aVAnd thus I\u2019ll curb her mad and headstrong humor
p66699
aVHe that knows better how to tame a shrew
p66700
aVNow let him speak \u2019tis charity to shew
p66701
aVIs \u2019t possible friend Litio that mistress Bianca
p66702
aVDoth fancy any other but Lucentio
p66703

p66715
aVI tell thee Litio this is wonderful
p66716
aVMistake no more I am not Litio
p66717
aVNor a musician as I seem to be
p66718
aVBut one that scorn to live in this disguise
p66719
aVFor such a one as leaves a gentleman
p66720
aVAnd makes a god of such a cullion
p66721
aVKnow sir that I am called Hortensio
p66722
aVSignior Hortensio I have often heard
p66723
aVOf your entire affection to Bianca
p66724
aVAnd since mine eyes are witness of her lightness
p66725
aVI will with you if you be so contented
p66726
aVForswear Bianca and her love forever
p66727
aVSee how they kiss and court Signior Lucentio
p66728
aVHere is my hand and here I firmly vow
p66729
aVNever to woo her more but do forswear her
p66730
aVAs one unworthy all the former favors
p66731
aVThat I have fondly flattered her withal
p66732
aVAnd here I take the like unfeignèd oath
p66733
aVNever to marry with her though she would entreat
p66734
aVFie on her see how beastly she doth court him
p66735
aVWould all the world but he had quite forsworn
p66736
aVFor me that I may surely keep mine oath
p66737
aVI will be married to a wealthy widow
p66738
aVEre three days pass which hath as long loved me
p66739
aVAs I have loved this proud disdainful haggard
p66740
aVAnd so farewell Signior Lucentio
p66741
aVKindness in women not their beauteous looks

p67314
aVCome come you\u2019re mocking We will have no telling
p67315
aVCome on I say and first begin with her
p67316
aVI say she shall And first begin with her
p67317
aVFie fie Unknit that threat\u2019ning unkind brow
p67318
aVAnd dart not scornful glances from those eyes
p67319
aVTo wound thy lord thy king thy governor
p67320
aVIt blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads
p67321
aVConfounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds
p67322
aVAnd in no sense is meet or amiable
p67323
aVA woman moved is like a fountain troubled
p67324
aVMuddy ill-seeming thick bereft of beauty
p67325
aVAnd while it is so none so dry or thirsty
p67326
aVWill deign to sip or touch one drop of it
p67327
aVThy husband is thy lord thy life thy keeper
p67328
aVThy head thy sovereign one that cares for thee
p67329
aVAnd for thy maintenance commits his body
p67330
aVTo painful labor both by sea and land
p67331
aVTo watch the night in storms the day in cold
p67332
aVWhilst thou liest warm at home secure and safe
p67333
aVAnd craves no other tribute at thy hands
p67334
aVBut love fair looks and true obedience
p67335
aVToo little payment for so great a debt
p67336
aVSuch duty as the subject owes the prince
p67337
aVEven such a woman oweth to her husband
p67338
aVAnd when she is froward peevish sullen sour
p67339
aVAnd not obedient to his honest will
p67340
aVWhat is she but a foul contending rebel
p67341
aVAnd graceless traitor to her loving lord
p67342
aVI am ashamed that women are so simple
p67343
aVTo offer war where they should kneel for peace
p67344
aVOr seek for rule supremacy and sway
p67345
aVWhen they are bound to serve love and obey
p67346
aVWhy are our bodies soft and weak and smooth
p67347
aVUnapt to toil and trouble in the world
p67348
aVBut that our soft conditions and our hearts
p67349
aVShould well agree with our external parts
p67350
aVCome come you froward and unable worms
p67351
aVMy mind hath been as big as one of yours
p67352
aVMy heart as great my reason haply more
p67353
aVTo bandy word for word and frown for frown
p67354
aVBut now I see our lances are but straws
p67355
aVOur strength as weak our weakness past compare
p67356
aVThat seeming to be most which we indeed least are
p67357
aVThen vail your stomachs for it is no boot
p67358
aVAnd place your hands below your husband\u2019s foot
p67359
aVIn token of which duty if he please
p67360
aVMy hand is ready may it do him ease
p67361
aVWhy there\u2019s a wench Come on and kiss me Kate
p67362
aVWell go thy ways old lad for thou shalt ha \u2019t
p67363
aV\u2019Tis a good hearing when children are toward
p67364
aVBut a harsh hearing when women are froward
p67365
aVCome Kate we\u2019ll to bed
p67366
aVWe three are married but you two are sped
p67367
aVTo Lucentio \u2019Twas I won the wager though you hit the white
p67368
aVAnd being a winner God give you good night
p67369
aVNow go thy ways thou hast tamed a curst shrow
p67370
aV\u2019Tis a wonder by your leave she will be tamed so
p67371
aVCease to persuade my loving Proteus
p67372
aVHome-keeping youth have ever homely wits
p67373
aVWere \u2019t not affection chains thy tender days
p67374
aVTo the sweet glances of thy honored love
p67375
aVI rather would entreat thy company
p67376
aVTo see the wonders of the world abroad
p67377
aVThan living dully sluggardized at home
p67378
aVWear out thy youth with shapeless idleness
p67379
aVBut since thou lov\u2019st love still and thrive therein
p67380
aVEven as I would when I to love begin
p67381
aVWilt thou be gone Sweet Valentine adieu
p67382
aVThink on thy Proteus when thou haply seest
p67383
aVSome rare noteworthy object in thy travel
p67384
aVWish me partaker in thy happiness
p67385
aVWhen thou dost meet good hap and in thy danger
p67386
aVIf ever danger do environ thee
p67387
aVCommend thy grievance to my holy prayers
p67388
aVFor I will be thy beadsman Valentine
p67389
aVAnd on a love-book pray for my success
p67390
aVUpon some book I love I\u2019ll pray for thee
p67391
aVThat\u2019s on some shallow story of deep love
p67392
aVHow young Leander crossed the Hellespont
p67393
aVThat\u2019s a deep story of a deeper love
p67394
aVFor he was more than over shoes in love
p67395
aV\u2019Tis true for you are over boots in love
p67396
aVAnd yet you never swam the Hellespont
p67397
aVOver the boots Nay give me not the boots
p67398
aVNo I will not for it boots thee not
p67399
aVWhat
p67400
aVTo be in love where scorn is bought with groans
p67401
aVCoy looks with heart-sore sighs one fading moment\u2019s mirth
p67402
aVWith twenty watchful weary tedious nights
p67403
aVIf haply won perhaps a hapless gain
p67404
aVIf lost why then a grievous labor won
p67405
aVHow ever but a folly bought with wit
p67406
aVOr else a wit by folly vanquishèd
p67407
aVSo by your circumstance you call me fool
p67408
aVSo by your circumstance I fear you\u2019ll prove
p67409
aV\u2019Tis love you cavil at I am not Love
p67410
aVLove is your master for he masters you
p67411
aVAnd he that is so yokèd by a fool
p67412
aVMethinks should not be chronicled for wise
p67413
aVYet writers say as in the sweetest bud
p67414
aVThe eating canker dwells so eating love
p67415
aVInhabits in the finest wits of all
p67416
aVAnd writers say as the most forward bud
p67417
aVIs eaten by the canker ere it blow
p67418
aVEven so by love the young and tender wit
p67419
aVIs turned to folly blasting in the bud
p67420
aVLosing his verdure even in the prime
p67421
aVAnd all the fair effects of future hopes
p67422
aVBut wherefore waste I time to counsel thee
p67423
aVThat art a votary to fond desire
p67424
aVOnce more adieu My father at the road
p67425
aVExpects my coming there to see me shipped
p67426
aVAnd thither will I bring thee Valentine
p67427
aVSweet Proteus no Now let us take our leave
p67428
aVTo Milan let me hear from thee by letters
p67429
aVOf thy success in love and what news else
p67430
aVBetideth here in absence of thy friend
p67431
aVAnd I likewise will visit thee with mine
p67432
aVAll happiness bechance to thee in Milan
p67433
aVAs much to you at home And so farewell
p67434
aVHe after honor hunts I after love
p67435
aVHe leaves his friends to dignify them more
p67436
aVI leave myself my friends and all for love
p67437
aVThou Julia thou hast metamorphosed me
p67438
aVMade me neglect my studies lose my time
p67439
aVWar with good counsel set the world at nought
p67440
aVMade wit with musing weak heart sick with thought
p67441
aVSir Proteus \u2019save you Saw you my master
p67442
aVBut now he parted hence to embark for Milan
p67443
aVTwenty to one then he is shipped already
p67444
aVAnd I have played the sheep in losing him
p67445
aVIndeed a sheep doth very often stray
p67446
aVAn if the shepherd be awhile away
p67447
aVFrom a pound to a pin Fold it over and over
p67448
aV\u2019Tis threefold too little for carrying a letter to your lover
p67449
aVGo go begone to save your ship from wrack
p67450
aVWhich cannot perish having thee aboard
p67451
aVBeing destined to a drier death on shore
p67452
aVI must go send some better messenger
p67453
aVI fear my Julia would not deign my lines
p67454
aVReceiving them from such a worthless post
p67455
aVBut say Lucetta now we are alone
p67456
aVWouldst thou then counsel me to fall in love
p67457
aVAy madam so you stumble not unheedfully
p67458
aVOf all the fair resort of gentlemen
p67459
aVThat every day with parle encounter me
p67460
aVIn thy opinion which is worthiest love
p67461
aVPlease you repeat their names I\u2019ll show my mind
p67462
aVAccording to my shallow simple skill
p67463
aVWhat think\u2019st thou of the fair Sir Eglamour
p67464
aVAs of a knight well-spoken neat and fine
p67465
aVBut were I you he never should be mine
p67466
aVWhat think\u2019st thou of the rich Mercatio
p67467
aVWell of his wealth but of himself so-so
p67468
aVWhat think\u2019st thou of the gentle Proteus
p67469
aVLord Lord to see what folly reigns in us
p67470
aVHow now What means this passion at his name
p67471
aVPardon dear madam \u2019tis a passing shame
p67472
aVThat I unworthy body as I am
p67473
aVShould censure thus on lovely gentlemen
p67474
aVWhy not on Proteus as of all the rest
p67475
aVThen thus of many good I think him best
p67476
aVYour reason
p67477
aVI have no other but a woman\u2019s reason
p67478
aVI think him so because I think him so
p67479
aVAnd wouldst thou have me cast my love on him
p67480
aVAy if you thought your love not cast away
p67481
aVWhy he of all the rest hath never moved me
p67482
aVYet he of all the rest I think best loves you
p67483
aVHis little speaking shows his love but small
p67484
aVFire that\u2019s closest kept burns most of all
p67485
aVThey do not love that do not show their love
p67486
aVO they love least that let men know their love
p67487
aVI would I knew his mind
p67488
aVPeruse this paper madam
p67489
aVTo Julia Say from whom
p67490
aVThat the contents will show
p67491
aVSay say who gave it thee
p67492
aVSir Valentine\u2019s page and sent I think from Proteus
p67493
aVHe would have given it you but I being in the way
p67494
aVDid in your name receive it Pardon the fault I pray
p67495
aVNow by my modesty a goodly broker
p67496
aVDare you presume to harbor wanton lines
p67497
aVTo whisper and conspire against my youth
p67498
aVNow trust me \u2019tis an office of great worth
p67499
aVAnd you an officer fit for the place
p67500
aVThere take the paper see it be returned
p67501
aVOr else return no more into my sight
p67502
aVTo plead for love deserves more fee than hate
p67503
aVWill you be gone
p67504
aVThat you may ruminate
p67505
aVAnd yet I would I had o\u2019erlooked the letter
p67506
aVIt were a shame to call her back again
p67507
aVAnd pray her to a fault for which I chid her
p67508
aVWhat fool is she that knows I am a maid
p67509
aVAnd would not force the letter to my view
p67510
aVSince maids in modesty say no to that
p67511
aVWhich they would have the profferer construe ay
p67512
aVFie fie how wayward is this foolish love
p67513
aVThat like a testy babe will scratch the nurse
p67514
aVAnd presently all humbled kiss the rod
p67515
aVHow churlishly I chid Lucetta hence
p67516
aVWhen willingly I would have had her here
p67517
aVHow angerly I taught my brow to frown
p67518
aVWhen inward joy enforced my heart to smile
p67519
aVMy penance is to call Lucetta back
p67520
aVAnd ask remission for my folly past
p67521
aVWhat ho Lucetta
p67522
aVWhat would your Ladyship
p67523
aVIs \u2019t near dinner time
p67524
aVI would it were
p67525
aVThat you might kill your stomach on your meat
p67526
aVAnd not upon your maid
p67527
aVWhat is \u2019t that you took up so gingerly
p67528
aVNothing
p67529
aVWhy didst thou stoop then
p67530
aVTo take a paper up that I let fall
p67531
aVAnd is that paper nothing
p67532
aVNothing concerning me
p67533
aVThen let it lie for those that it concerns
p67534
aVMadam it will not lie where it concerns
p67535
aVUnless it have a false interpreter
p67536
aVSome love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme
p67537
aVThat I might sing it madam to a tune
p67538
aVGive me a note Your Ladyship can set
p67539
aVAs little by such toys as may be possible
p67540
aVBest sing it to the tune of Light o\u2019 Love

aVAy and melodious were it would you sing it
p67544
aVAnd why not you

aVI cannot reach so high
p67546
aVLet\u2019s see your song How now minion

aVAnd yet methinks I do not like this tune
p67549
aVYou do not
p67550
aVNo madam \u2019tis too sharp
p67551
aVYou minion are too saucy
p67552
aVNay now you are too flat
p67553
aVAnd mar the concord with too harsh a descant
p67554
aVThere wanteth but a mean to fill your song
p67555
aVThe mean is drowned with your unruly bass
p67556
aVIndeed I bid the base for Proteus
p67557
aVThis babble shall not henceforth trouble me
p67558
aVHere is a coil with protestation
p67559
aVGo get you gone and let the papers lie
p67560
aVYou would be fing\u2019ring them to anger me
p67561
aVShe makes it strange but she would be best pleased
p67562
aVTo be so angered with another letter
p67563
aVNay would I were so angered with the same
p67564
aVO hateful hands to tear such loving words
p67565
aVInjurious wasps to feed on such sweet honey
p67566
aVAnd kill the bees that yield it with your stings
p67567
aVI\u2019ll kiss each several paper for amends
p67568
aVLook here is writ kind Julia Unkind Julia
p67569
aVAs in revenge of thy ingratitude
p67570
aVI throw thy name against the bruising stones
p67571
aVTrampling contemptuously on thy disdain
p67572
aVAnd here is writ love-wounded Proteus
p67573
aVPoor wounded name my bosom as a bed
p67574
aVShall lodge thee till thy wound be throughly healed
p67575
aVAnd thus I search it with a sovereign kiss
p67576
aVBut twice or thrice was Proteus written down
p67577
aVBe calm good wind Blow not a word away
p67578
aVTill I have found each letter in the letter
p67579
aVExcept mine own name That some whirlwind bear
p67580
aVUnto a ragged fearful hanging rock
p67581
aVAnd throw it thence into the raging sea
p67582
aVLo here in one line is his name twice writ
p67583
aVPoor forlorn Proteus passionate Proteus
p67584
aVTo the sweet Julia That I\u2019ll tear away
p67585
aVAnd yet I will not sith so prettily
p67586
aVHe couples it to his complaining names
p67587
aVThus will I fold them one upon another

p67600
aVWherewith my brother held you in the cloister
p67601
aV\u2019Twas of his nephew Proteus your son
p67602
aVWhy what of him
p67603
aVHe wondered that your Lordship
p67604
aVWould suffer him to spend his youth at home
p67605
aVWhile other men of slender reputation
p67606
aVPut forth their sons to seek preferment out
p67607
aVSome to the wars to try their fortune there
p67608
aVSome to discover islands far away
p67609
aVSome to the studious universities
p67610
aVFor any or for all these exercises
p67611
aVHe said that Proteus your son was meet
p67612
aVAnd did request me to importune you
p67613
aVTo let him spend his time no more at home
p67614
aVWhich would be great impeachment to his age
p67615
aVIn having known no travel in his youth
p67616
aVNor need\u2019st thou much importune me to that
p67617
aVWhereon this month I have been hammering
p67618

aVAnd how he cannot be a perfect man
p67620
aVNot being tried and tutored in the world
p67621
aVExperience is by industry achieved
p67622
aVAnd perfected by the swift course of time

aVWhose high imperious thoughts have punished me
p67847
aVWith bitter fasts with penitential groans
p67848
aVWith nightly tears and daily heartsore sighs
p67849
aVFor in revenge of my contempt of love
p67850

aVWhen I was sick you gave me bitter pills
p67867
aVAnd I must minister the like to you

aVHave I not reason to prefer mine own
p67875
aVAnd I will help thee to prefer her too
p67876
aVShe shall be dignified with this high honor
p67877
aVTo bear my lady\u2019s train lest the base earth
p67878
aVShould from her vesture chance to steal a kiss
p67879

aVMy foolish rival that her father likes
p67894
aVOnly for his possessions are so huge
p67895
aVIs gone with her along and I must after

aVPlotted and \u2019greed on for my happiness
p67903
aVGood Proteus go with me to my chamber
p67904
aVIn these affairs to aid me with thy counsel
p67905
aVGo on before I shall inquire you forth
p67906
aVI must unto the road to disembark
p67907
aVSome necessaries that I needs must use
p67908
aVAnd then I\u2019ll presently attend you
p67909
aVWill you make haste
p67910
aVI will
p67911
aVEven as one heat another heat expels
p67912
aVOr as one nail by strength drives out another
p67913
aVSo the remembrance of my former love
p67914
aVIs by a newer object quite forgotten
p67915
aVIs it mine eye or Valentine\u2019s praise
p67916
aVHer true perfection or my false transgression
p67917
aVThat makes me reasonless to reason thus
p67918
aVShe is fair and so is Julia that I love
p67919
aVThat I did love for now my love is thawed
p67920
aVWhich like a waxen image \u2019gainst a fire
p67921
aVBears no impression of the thing it was
p67922
aVMethinks my zeal to Valentine is cold
p67923
aVAnd that I love him not as I was wont
p67924
aVO but I love his lady too too much
p67925
aVAnd that\u2019s the reason I love him so little
p67926
aVHow shall I dote on her with more advice
p67927
aVThat thus without advice begin to love her
p67928
aV\u2019Tis but her picture I have yet beheld
p67929
aVAnd that hath dazzled my reason\u2019s light
p67930
aVBut when I look on her perfections
p67931
aVThere is no reason but I shall be blind
p67932
aVIf I can check my erring love I will
p67933
aVIf not to compass her I\u2019ll use my skill
p67934
aVTo leave my Julia shall I be forsworn
p67935
aVTo love fair Sylvia shall I be forsworn
p67936
aVTo wrong my friend I shall be much forsworn
p67937
aVAnd ev\u2019n that power which gave me first my oath
p67938
aVProvokes me to this threefold perjury
p67939
aVLove bade me swear and love bids me forswear
p67940
aVO sweet-suggesting Love if thou hast sinned
p67941
aVTeach me thy tempted subject to excuse it
p67942
aVAt first I did adore a twinkling star
p67943
aVBut now I worship a celestial sun
p67944
aVUnheedful vows may heedfully be broken
p67945
aVAnd he wants wit that wants resolvèd will
p67946
aVTo learn his wit t\u2019 exchange the bad for better
p67947
aVFie fie unreverend tongue to call her bad
p67948
aVWhose sovereignty so oft thou hast preferred
p67949
aVWith twenty thousand soul-confirming oaths
p67950
aVI cannot leave to love and yet I do
p67951
aVBut there I leave to love where I should love
p67952
aVJulia I lose and Valentine I lose
p67953
aVIf I keep them I needs must lose myself
p67954
aVIf I lose them thus find I by their loss
p67955
aVFor Valentine myself for Julia Sylvia
p67956
aVI to myself am dearer than a friend
p67957
aVFor love is still most precious in itself
p67958
aVAnd Sylvia witness heaven that made her fair
p67959
aVShows Julia but a swarthy Ethiope
p67960
aVI will forget that Julia is alive
p67961
aVRememb\u2019ring that my love to her is dead
p67962
aVAnd Valentine I\u2019ll hold an enemy
p67963
aVAiming at Sylvia as a sweeter friend
p67964
aVI cannot now prove constant to myself
p67965
aVWithout some treachery used to Valentine
p67966
aVThis night he meaneth with a corded ladder
p67967
aVTo climb celestial Sylvia\u2019s chamber window
p67968
aVMyself in counsel his competitor
p67969
aVNow presently I\u2019ll give her father notice
p67970
aVOf their disguising and pretended flight
p67971
aVWho all enraged will banish Valentine
p67972
aVFor Thurio he intends shall wed his daughter
p67973
aVBut Valentine being gone I\u2019ll quickly cross
p67974
aVBy some sly trick blunt Thurio\u2019s dull proceeding
p67975
aVLove lend me wings to make my purpose swift
p67976
aVAs thou hast lent me wit to plot this drift
p67977
aVCounsel Lucetta Gentle girl assist me
p67978
aVAnd ev\u2019n in kind love I do conjure thee
p67979
aVWho art the table wherein all my thoughts
p67980
aVAre visibly charactered and engraved
p67981
aVTo lesson me and tell me some good mean
p67982
aVHow with my honor I may undertake
p67983
aVA journey to my loving Proteus
p67984
aVAlas the way is wearisome and long
p67985
aVA true-devoted pilgrim is not weary
p67986
aVTo measure kingdoms with his feeble steps
p67987
aVMuch less shall she that hath Love\u2019s wings to fly
p67988
aVAnd when the flight is made to one so dear
p67989
aVOf such divine perfection as Sir Proteus
p67990
aVBetter forbear till Proteus make return
p67991
aVO know\u2019st thou not his looks are my soul\u2019s food
p67992
aVPity the dearth that I have pinèd in
p67993
aVBy longing for that food so long a time
p67994
aVDidst thou but know the inly touch of love
p67995
aVThou wouldst as soon go kindle fire with snow
p67996
aVAs seek to quench the fire of love with words
p67997
aVI do not seek to quench your love\u2019s hot fire
p67998
aVBut qualify the fire\u2019s extreme rage
p67999
aVLest it should burn above the bounds of reason
p68000
aVThe more thou damm\u2019st it up the more it burns
p68001
aVThe current that with gentle murmur glides
p68002
aVThou know\u2019st being stopped impatiently doth rage
p68003
aVBut when his fair course is not hinderèd
p68004
aVHe makes sweet music with th\u2019 enameled stones
p68005
aVGiving a gentle kiss to every sedge
p68006
aVHe overtaketh in his pilgrimage
p68007
aVAnd so by many winding nooks he strays
p68008
aVWith willing sport to the wild ocean
p68009
aVThen let me go and hinder not my course
p68010
aVI\u2019ll be as patient as a gentle stream
p68011
aVAnd make a pastime of each weary step
p68012
aVTill the last step have brought me to my love
p68013
aVAnd there I\u2019ll rest as after much turmoil
p68014
aVA blessèd soul doth in Elysium
p68015
aVBut in what habit will you go along
p68016
aVNot like a woman for I would prevent
p68017
aVThe loose encounters of lascivious men
p68018
aVGentle Lucetta fit me with such weeds
p68019
aVAs may beseem some well-reputed page
p68020
aVWhy then your Ladyship must cut your hair
p68021
aVNo girl I\u2019ll knit it up in silken strings
p68022
aVWith twenty odd-conceited true-love knots
p68023
aVTo be fantastic may become a youth
p68024
aVOf greater time than I shall show to be
p68025
aVWhat fashion madam shall I make your breeches
p68026
aVThat fits as well as Tell me good my lord
p68027
aVWhat compass will you wear your farthingale
p68028
aVWhy ev\u2019n what fashion thou best likes Lucetta
p68029
aVYou must needs have them with a codpiece madam
p68030
aVOut out Lucetta That will be ill-favored
p68031
aVA round hose madam now\u2019s not worth a pin
p68032
aVUnless you have a codpiece to stick pins on
p68033
aVLucetta as thou lov\u2019st me let me have
p68034
aVWhat thou think\u2019st meet and is most mannerly
p68035
aVBut tell me wench how will the world repute me
p68036
aVFor undertaking so unstaid a journey
p68037
aVI fear me it will make me scandalized
p68038
aVIf you think so then stay at home and go not
p68039
aVNay that I will not
p68040
aVThen never dream on infamy but go
p68041
aVIf Proteus like your journey when you come
p68042
aVNo matter who\u2019s displeased when you are gone
p68043
aVI fear me he will scarce be pleased withal
p68044
aVThat is the least Lucetta of my fear
p68045
aVA thousand oaths an ocean of his tears
p68046
aVAnd instances of infinite of love
p68047
aVWarrant me welcome to my Proteus
p68048
aVAll these are servants to deceitful men
p68049
aVBase men that use them to so base effect
p68050
aVBut truer stars did govern Proteus\u2019 birth
p68051
aVHis words are bonds his oaths are oracles
p68052
aVHis love sincere his thoughts immaculate
p68053
aVHis tears pure messengers sent from his heart
p68054
aVHis heart as far from fraud as heaven from Earth
p68055
aVPray heav\u2019n he prove so when you come to him
p68056
aVNow as thou lov\u2019st me do him not that wrong
p68057
aVTo bear a hard opinion of his truth
p68058
aVOnly deserve my love by loving him
p68059
aVAnd presently go with me to my chamber
p68060
aVTo take a note of what I stand in need of
p68061
aVTo furnish me upon my longing journey
p68062
aVAll that is mine I leave at thy dispose
p68063
aVMy goods my lands my reputation
p68064
aVOnly in lieu thereof dispatch me hence
p68065
aVCome answer not but to it presently
p68066
aVI am impatient of my tarriance
p68067
aVSir Thurio give us leave I pray awhile
p68068
aVWe have some secrets to confer about
p68069
aVNow tell me Proteus what\u2019s your will with me
p68070
aVMy gracious lord that which I would discover
p68071
aVThe law of friendship bids me to conceal
p68072
aVBut when I call to mind your gracious favors
p68073
aVDone to me undeserving as I am
p68074
aVMy duty pricks me on to utter that
p68075
aVWhich else no worldly good should draw from me
p68076
aVKnow worthy prince Sir Valentine my friend
p68077
aVThis night intends to steal away your daughter
p68078
aVMyself am one made privy to the plot
p68079
aVI know you have determined to bestow her
p68080
aVOn Thurio whom your gentle daughter hates
p68081
aVAnd should she thus be stol\u2019n away from you
p68082
aVIt would be much vexation to your age
p68083
aVThus for my duty\u2019s sake I rather chose
p68084
aVTo cross my friend in his intended drift
p68085
aVThan by concealing it heap on your head
p68086
aVA pack of sorrows which would press you down
p68087
aVBeing unprevented to your timeless grave
p68088
aVProteus I thank thee for thine honest care
p68089
aVWhich to requite command me while I live
p68090
aVThis love of theirs myself have often seen
p68091
aVHaply when they have judged me fast asleep
p68092
aVAnd oftentimes have purposed to forbid
p68093
aVSir Valentine her company and my court
p68094
aVBut fearing lest my jealous aim might err
p68095
aVAnd so unworthily disgrace the man
p68096
aVA rashness that I ever yet have shunned
p68097
aVI gave him gentle looks thereby to find
p68098
aVThat which thyself hast now disclosed to me
p68099
aVAnd that thou mayst perceive my fear of this
p68100
aVKnowing that tender youth is soon suggested
p68101
aVI nightly lodge her in an upper tower
p68102
aVThe key whereof myself have ever kept
p68103
aVAnd thence she cannot be conveyed away
p68104
aVKnow noble lord they have devised a mean
p68105
aVHow he her chamber-window will ascend
p68106
aVAnd with a corded ladder fetch her down
p68107
aVFor which the youthful lover now is gone
p68108
aVAnd this way comes he with it presently
p68109
aVWhere if it please you you may intercept him
p68110
aVBut good my lord do it so cunningly
p68111
aVThat my discovery be not aimèd at
p68112
aVFor love of you not hate unto my friend
p68113
aVHath made me publisher of this pretense
p68114
aVUpon mine honor he shall never know
p68115
aVThat I had any light from thee of this
p68116
aVAdieu my lord Sir Valentine is coming
p68117
aVSir Valentine whither away so fast
p68118
aVPlease it your Grace there is a messenger
p68119
aVThat stays to bear my letters to my friends
p68120
aVAnd I am going to deliver them
p68121
aVBe they of much import
p68122
aVThe tenor of them doth but signify
p68123
aVMy health and happy being at your court
p68124
aVNay then no matter Stay with me awhile
p68125
aVI am to break with thee of some affairs
p68126
aVThat touch me near wherein thou must be secret
p68127
aV\u2019Tis not unknown to thee that I have sought
p68128
aVTo match my friend Sir Thurio to my daughter
p68129
aVI know it well my lord and sure the match
p68130
aVWere rich and honorable Besides the gentleman
p68131
aVIs full of virtue bounty worth and qualities
p68132
aVBeseeming such a wife as your fair daughter
p68133
aVCannot your Grace win her to fancy him
p68134
aVNo Trust me she is peevish sullen froward
p68135
aVProud disobedient stubborn lacking duty
p68136
aVNeither regarding that she is my child
p68137
aVNor fearing me as if I were her father
p68138
aVAnd may I say to thee this pride of hers
p68139
aVUpon advice hath drawn my love from her
p68140
aVAnd where I thought the remnant of mine age
p68141
aVShould have been cherished by her childlike duty
p68142
aVI now am full resolved to take a wife
p68143
aVAnd turn her out to who will take her in
p68144
aVThen let her beauty be her wedding dower
p68145
aVFor me and my possessions she esteems not
p68146
aVWhat would your Grace have me to do in this
p68147
aVThere is a lady in Verona here
p68148
aVWhom I affect but she is nice and coy
p68149
aVAnd nought esteems my agèd eloquence
p68150
aVNow therefore would I have thee to my tutor
p68151
aVFor long agone I have forgot to court
p68152
aVBesides the fashion of the time is changed
p68153
aVHow and which way I may bestow myself
p68154
aVTo be regarded in her sun-bright eye
p68155
aVWin her with gifts if she respect not words
p68156
aVDumb jewels often in their silent kind
p68157
aVMore than quick words do move a woman\u2019s mind
p68158
aVBut she did scorn a present that I sent her
p68159
aVA woman sometime scorns what best contents her
p68160
aVSend her another never give her o\u2019er
p68161
aVFor scorn at first makes after-love the more
p68162
aVIf she do frown \u2019tis not in hate of you
p68163
aVBut rather to beget more love in you
p68164
aVIf she do chide \u2019tis not to have you gone
p68165
aVForwhy the fools are mad if left alone
p68166
aVTake no repulse whatever she doth say
p68167
aVFor get you gone she doth not mean away
p68168
aVFlatter and praise commend extol their graces
p68169
aVThough ne\u2019er so black say they have angels\u2019 faces
p68170
aVThat man that hath a tongue I say is no man
p68171
aVIf with his tongue he cannot win a woman
p68172
aVBut she I mean is promised by her friends
p68173
aVUnto a youthful gentleman of worth
p68174
aVAnd kept severely from resort of men
p68175
aVThat no man hath access by day to her
p68176
aVWhy then I would resort to her by night
p68177
aVAy but the doors be locked and keys kept safe
p68178
aVThat no man hath recourse to her by night
p68179
aVWhat lets but one may enter at her window
p68180
aVHer chamber is aloft far from the ground
p68181
aVAnd built so shelving that one cannot climb it
p68182
aVWithout apparent hazard of his life
p68183
aVWhy then a ladder quaintly made of cords
p68184
aVTo cast up with a pair of anchoring hooks
p68185
aVWould serve to scale another Hero\u2019s tower
p68186
aVSo bold Leander would adventure it
p68187
aVNow as thou art a gentleman of blood
p68188
aVAdvise me where I may have such a ladder
p68189
aVWhen would you use it Pray sir tell me that
p68190
aVThis very night for love is like a child
p68191
aVThat longs for everything that he can come by
p68192
aVBy seven o\u2019clock I\u2019ll get you such a ladder
p68193
aVBut hark thee I will go to her alone
p68194
aVHow shall I best convey the ladder thither
p68195
aVIt will be light my lord that you may bear it
p68196
aVUnder a cloak that is of any length
p68197
aVA cloak as long as thine will serve the turn
p68198
aVAy my good lord
p68199
aVThen let me see thy cloak
p68200
aVI\u2019ll get me one of such another length
p68201
aVWhy any cloak will serve the turn my lord
p68202
aVHow shall I fashion me to wear a cloak
p68203
aVI pray thee let me feel thy cloak upon me
p68204
aVWhat letter is this same What\u2019s here Reads To Sylvia
p68205
aVAnd here an engine fit for my proceeding
p68206
aVI\u2019ll be so bold to break the seal for once
p68207
aVMy thoughts do harbor with my Sylvia nightly
p68208
aVAnd slaves they are to me that send them flying
p68209
aVO could their master come and go as lightly
p68210
aVHimself would lodge where senseless they are lying
p68211
aVMy herald thoughts in thy pure bosom rest them
p68212
aVWhile I their king that thither them importune
p68213
aVDo curse the grace that with such grace hath blest them
p68214
aVBecause myself do want my servants\u2019 fortune
p68215
aVI curse myself for they are sent by me
p68216
aVThat they should harbor where their lord should be
p68217
aVWhat\u2019s here
p68218
aVSylvia this night I will enfranchise thee
p68219
aV\u2019Tis so And here\u2019s the ladder for the purpose
p68220
aVWhy Phaëton for thou art Merops\u2019 son
p68221
aVWilt thou aspire to guide the heavenly car
p68222
aVAnd with thy daring folly burn the world
p68223
aVWilt thou reach stars because they shine on thee
p68224
aVGo base intruder overweening slave
p68225
aVBestow thy fawning smiles on equal mates
p68226
aVAnd think my patience more than thy desert
p68227
aVIs privilege for thy departure hence
p68228
aVThank me for this more than for all the favors
p68229
aVWhich all too much I have bestowed on thee
p68230
aVBut if thou linger in my territories
p68231
aVLonger than swiftest expedition
p68232
aVWill give thee time to leave our royal court
p68233
aVBy heaven my wrath shall far exceed the love
p68234
aVI ever bore my daughter or thyself
p68235
aVBegone I will not hear thy vain excuse
p68236
aVBut as thou lov\u2019st thy life make speed from hence
p68237
aVAnd why not death rather than living torment
p68238
aVTo die is to be banished from myself
p68239
aVAnd Sylvia is myself banished from her
p68240
aVIs self from self a deadly banishment
p68241
aVWhat light is light if Sylvia be not seen
p68242
aVWhat joy is joy if Sylvia be not by
p68243
aVUnless it be to think that she is by
p68244
aVAnd feed upon the shadow of perfection
p68245
aVExcept I be by Sylvia in the night
p68246
aVThere is no music in the nightingale
p68247
aVUnless I look on Sylvia in the day
p68248
aVThere is no day for me to look upon
p68249
aVShe is my essence and I leave to be
p68250
aVIf I be not by her fair influence
p68251
aVFostered illumined cherished kept alive
p68252
aVI fly not death to fly his deadly doom
p68253
aVTarry I here I but attend on death
p68254
aVBut fly I hence I fly away from life
p68255
aVSirrah I say forbear Friend Valentine a word
p68256
aVMy ears are stopped and cannot hear good news
p68257
aVSo much of bad already hath possessed them
p68258
aVThen in dumb silence will I bury mine
p68259
aVFor they are harsh untunable and bad
p68260
aVIs Sylvia dead
p68261
aVNo Valentine
p68262
aVNo Valentine indeed for sacred Sylvia
p68263
aVHath she forsworn me
p68264
aVNo Valentine
p68265
aVNo Valentine if Sylvia have forsworn me
p68266
aVWhat is your news
p68267
aVThat thou art banishèd O that\u2019s the news
p68268
aVFrom hence from Sylvia and from me thy friend
p68269
aVO I have fed upon this woe already
p68270
aVAnd now excess of it will make me surfeit
p68271
aVDoth Sylvia know that I am banishèd
p68272
aVAy ay and she hath offered to the doom
p68273
aVWhich unreversed stands in effectual force
p68274
aVA sea of melting pearl which some call tears
p68275
aVThose at her father\u2019s churlish feet she tendered
p68276
aVWith them upon her knees her humble self
p68277
aVWringing her hands whose whiteness so became them
p68278
aVAs if but now they waxèd pale for woe
p68279
aVBut neither bended knees pure hands held up
p68280
aVSad sighs deep groans nor silver-shedding tears
p68281
aVCould penetrate her uncompassionate sire
p68282
aVBut Valentine if he be ta\u2019en must die
p68283
aVBesides her intercession chafed him so
p68284
aVWhen she for thy repeal was suppliant
p68285
aVThat to close prison he commanded her
p68286
aVWith many bitter threats of biding there
p68287
aVNo more unless the next word that thou speak\u2019st
p68288
aVHave some malignant power upon my life
p68289
aVIf so I pray thee breathe it in mine ear
p68290
aVAs ending anthem of my endless dolor
p68291
aVCease to lament for that thou canst not help
p68292
aVAnd study help for that which thou lament\u2019st
p68293
aVTime is the nurse and breeder of all good
p68294
aVHere if thou stay thou canst not see thy love
p68295
aVBesides thy staying will abridge thy life
p68296
aVHope is a lover\u2019s staff walk hence with that
p68297
aVAnd manage it against despairing thoughts
p68298
aVThy letters may be here though thou art hence
p68299
aVWhich being writ to me shall be delivered
p68300
aVEven in the milk-white bosom of thy love
p68301
aVThe time now serves not to expostulate
p68302
aVCome I\u2019ll convey thee through the city gate
p68303
aVAnd ere I part with thee confer at large
p68304
aVOf all that may concern thy love affairs
p68305
aVAs thou lov\u2019st Sylvia though not for thyself
p68306
aVRegard thy danger and along with me
p68307
aVI pray thee Lance an if thou seest my boy
p68308
aVBid him make haste and meet me at the North Gate
p68309
aVGo sirrah find him out Come Valentine
p68310
aVO my dear Sylvia Hapless Valentine
p68311
aVSir Thurio fear not but that she will love you
p68312
aVNow Valentine is banished from her sight
p68313
aVSince his exile she hath despised me most
p68314
aVForsworn my company and railed at me
p68315
aVThat I am desperate of obtaining her
p68316
aVThis weak impress of love is as a figure
p68317
aVTrenchèd in ice which with an hour\u2019s heat
p68318
aVDissolves to water and doth lose his form
p68319
aVA little time will melt her frozen thoughts
p68320
aVAnd worthless Valentine shall be forgot
p68321
aVHow now Sir Proteus Is your countryman
p68322
aVAccording to our proclamation gone
p68323
aVGone my good lord
p68324
aVMy daughter takes his going grievously
p68325
aVA little time my lord will kill that grief
p68326
aVSo I believe but Thurio thinks not so
p68327
aVProteus the good conceit I hold of thee
p68328
aVFor thou hast shown some sign of good desert
p68329
aVMakes me the better to confer with thee
p68330
aVLonger than I prove loyal to your Grace
p68331
aVLet me not live to look upon your Grace
p68332
aVThou know\u2019st how willingly I would effect
p68333
aVThe match between Sir Thurio and my daughter
p68334
aVI do my lord
p68335
aVAnd also I think thou art not ignorant
p68336
aVHow she opposes her against my will
p68337
aVShe did my lord when Valentine was here
p68338
aVAy and perversely she persevers so
p68339
aVWhat might we do to make the girl forget
p68340
aVThe love of Valentine and love Sir Thurio
p68341
aVThe best way is to slander Valentine
p68342
aVWith falsehood cowardice and poor descent
p68343
aVThree things that women highly hold in hate
p68344
aVAy but she\u2019ll think that it is spoke in hate
p68345
aVAy if his enemy deliver it
p68346
aVTherefore it must with circumstance be spoken
p68347
aVBy one whom she esteemeth as his friend
p68348
aVThen you must undertake to slander him
p68349
aVAnd that my lord I shall be loath to do
p68350
aV\u2019Tis an ill office for a gentleman
p68351
aVEspecially against his very friend
p68352
aVWhere your good word cannot advantage him
p68353
aVYour slander never can endamage him
p68354
aVTherefore the office is indifferent
p68355
aVBeing entreated to it by your friend
p68356
aVYou have prevailed my lord If I can do it
p68357
aVBy aught that I can speak in his dispraise
p68358
aVShe shall not long continue love to him
p68359
aVBut say this weed her love from Valentine
p68360
aVIt follows not that she will love Sir Thurio
p68361
aVTherefore as you unwind her love from him
p68362
aVLest it should ravel and be good to none
p68363
aVYou must provide to bottom it on me
p68364
aVWhich must be done by praising me as much
p68365
aVAs you in worth dispraise Sir Valentine
p68366
aVAnd Proteus we dare trust you in this kind
p68367
aVBecause we know on Valentine\u2019s report
p68368
aVYou are already Love\u2019s firm votary
p68369
aVAnd cannot soon revolt and change your mind
p68370
aVUpon this warrant shall you have access
p68371
aVWhere you with Sylvia may confer at large
p68372
aVFor she is lumpish heavy melancholy
p68373
aVAnd for your friend\u2019s sake will be glad of you
p68374
aVWhere you may temper her by your persuasion
p68375
aVTo hate young Valentine and love my friend
p68376
aVAs much as I can do I will effect
p68377
aVBut you Sir Thurio are not sharp enough
p68378
aVYou must lay lime to tangle her desires
p68379
aVBy wailful sonnets whose composèd rhymes
p68380
aVShould be full-fraught with serviceable vows
p68381
aVAy much is the force of heaven-bred poesy
p68382
aVSay that upon the altar of her beauty
p68383
aVYou sacrifice your tears your sighs your heart
p68384
aVWrite till your ink be dry and with your tears
p68385
aVMoist it again and frame some feeling line
p68386
aVThat may discover such integrity
p68387
aVFor Orpheus\u2019 lute was strung with poets\u2019 sinews
p68388
aVWhose golden touch could soften steel and stones
p68389
aVMake tigers tame and huge leviathans
p68390
aVForsake unsounded deeps to dance on sands
p68391
aVAfter your dire-lamenting elegies
p68392
aVVisit by night your lady\u2019s chamber window
p68393
aVWith some sweet consort to their instruments
p68394
aVTune a deploring dump the night\u2019s dead silence
p68395
aVWill well become such sweet complaining grievance
p68396
aVThis or else nothing will inherit her
p68397
aVThis discipline shows thou hast been in love
p68398
aVAnd thy advice this night I\u2019ll put in practice
p68399
aVTherefore sweet Proteus my direction-giver
p68400
aVLet us into the city presently
p68401
aVTo sort some gentlemen well-skilled in music
p68402
aVI have a sonnet that will serve the turn
p68403
aVTo give the onset to thy good advice
p68404
aVAbout it gentlemen
p68405
aVWe\u2019ll wait upon your Grace till after supper
p68406
aVAnd afterward determine our proceedings
p68407
aVEven now about it I will pardon you
p68408
aVFellows stand fast I see a passenger
p68409
aVIf there be ten shrink not but down with \u2019em
p68410
aVStand sir and throw us that you have about you
p68411
aVIf not we\u2019ll make you sit and rifle you
p68412
aVSir we are undone these are the villains
p68413
aVThat all the travelers do fear so much
p68414
aVMy friends
p68415
aVThat\u2019s not so sir We are your enemies
p68416
aVPeace We\u2019ll hear him
p68417
aVAy by my beard will we for he is a proper man
p68418
aVThen know that I have little wealth to lose
p68419
aVA man I am crossed with adversity
p68420
aVMy riches are these poor habiliments
p68421
aVOf which if you should here disfurnish me
p68422
aVYou take the sum and substance that I have
p68423
aVWhither travel you
p68424
aVTo Verona
p68425
aVWhence came you
p68426
aVFrom Milan
p68427
aVHave you long sojourned there
p68428
aVSome sixteen months and longer might have stayed
p68429
aVIf crooked fortune had not thwarted me
p68430
aVWhat were you banished thence
p68431
aVI was
p68432
aVFor what offense
p68433
aVFor that which now torments me to rehearse
p68434
aVI killed a man whose death I much repent
p68435
aVBut yet I slew him manfully in fight
p68436
aVWithout false vantage or base treachery
p68437
aVWhy ne\u2019er repent it if it were done so
p68438
aVBut were you banished for so small a fault
p68439
aVI was and held me glad of such a doom
p68440
aVHave you the tongues
p68441
aVMy youthful travel therein made me happy
p68442
aVOr else I often had been miserable
p68443
aVBy the bare scalp of Robin Hood\u2019s fat friar
p68444
aVThis fellow were a king for our wild faction
p68445
aVWe\u2019ll have him Sirs a word
p68446
aVPeace villain
p68447
aVTell us this have you anything to take to
p68448
aVNothing but my fortune
p68449
aVKnow then that some of us are gentlemen
p68450
aVSuch as the fury of ungoverned youth
p68451
aVThrust from the company of awful men
p68452
aVMyself was from Verona banishèd
p68453
aVFor practicing to steal away a lady
p68454
aVAn heir and near allied unto the Duke
p68455
aVAnd I from Mantua for a gentleman
p68456
aVWho in my mood I stabbed unto the heart
p68457
aVAnd I for such like petty crimes as these
p68458
aVBut to the purpose for we cite our faults
p68459
aVThat they may hold excused our lawless lives
p68460
aVAnd partly seeing you are beautified
p68461
aVWith goodly shape and by your own report
p68462
aVA linguist and a man of such perfection
p68463
aVAs we do in our quality much want
p68464
aVIndeed because you are a banished man
p68465
aVTherefore above the rest we parley to you
p68466
aVAre you content to be our general
p68467
aVTo make a virtue of necessity
p68468
aVAnd live as we do in this wilderness
p68469
aVWhat sayst thou Wilt thou be of our consort
p68470
aVSay ay and be the captain of us all
p68471
aVWe\u2019ll do thee homage and be ruled by thee
p68472
aVLove thee as our commander and our king
p68473
aVBut if thou scorn our courtesy thou diest
p68474
aVThou shalt not live to brag what we have offered
p68475
aVI take your offer and will live with you
p68476
aVProvided that you do no outrages
p68477
aVOn silly women or poor passengers
p68478
aVNo we detest such vile base practices
p68479
aVCome go with us we\u2019ll bring thee to our crews
p68480
aVAnd show thee all the treasure we have got
p68481
aVWhich with ourselves all rest at thy dispose
p68482
aVAlready have I been false to Valentine
p68483
aVAnd now I must be as unjust to Thurio
p68484
aVUnder the color of commending him
p68485
aVI have access my own love to prefer
p68486
aVBut Sylvia is too fair too true too holy
p68487
aVTo be corrupted with my worthless gifts
p68488
aVWhen I protest true loyalty to her
p68489
aVShe twits me with my falsehood to my friend
p68490
aVWhen to her beauty I commend my vows
p68491
aVShe bids me think how I have been forsworn
p68492
aVIn breaking faith with Julia whom I loved
p68493
aVAnd notwithstanding all her sudden quips
p68494
aVThe least whereof would quell a lover\u2019s hope
p68495
aVYet spaniel-like the more she spurns my love
p68496
aVThe more it grows and fawneth on her still
p68497
aVBut here comes Thurio Now must we to her window
p68498
aVAnd give some evening music to her ear
p68499
aVHow now Sir Proteus are you crept before us
p68500
aVAy gentle Thurio for you know that love
p68501
aVWill creep in service where it cannot go
p68502
aVAy but I hope sir that you love not here
p68503
aVSir but I do or else I would be hence
p68504
aVWho Sylvia

p68508
aVWho is Sylvia What is she
p68509
aVThat all our swains commend her
p68510
aVHoly fair and wise is she
p68511
aVThe heaven such grace did lend her
p68512
aVThat she might admirèd be
p68513
aVIs she kind as she is fair
p68514
aVFor beauty lives with kindness
p68515
aVLove doth to her eyes repair
p68516
aVTo help him of his blindness
p68517
aVAnd being helped inhabits there
p68518
aVThen to Sylvia let us sing
p68519
aVThat Sylvia is excelling
p68520
aVShe excels each mortal thing
p68521
aVUpon the dull earth dwelling
p68522
aVTo her let us garlands bring
p68523
aVI would always have one play but one thing
p68524
aVBut host doth this Sir Proteus that we talk on
p68525
aVOften resort unto this gentlewoman
p68526
aVSir Thurio fear not you I will so plead
p68527
aVThat you shall say my cunning drift excels

p68534
aVOne lady if you knew his pure heart\u2019s truth
p68535
aVYou would quickly learn to know him by his voice
p68536
aVSir Proteus as I take it
p68537
aVSir Proteus gentle lady and your servant

p68541
aVThat presently you hie you home to bed
p68542
aVThou subtle perjured false disloyal man
p68543
aVThink\u2019st thou I am so shallow so conceitless
p68544
aVTo be seducèd by thy flattery
p68545
aVThat hast deceived so many with thy vows
p68546
aVReturn return and make thy love amends
p68547
aVFor me by this pale queen of night I swear
p68548
aVI am so far from granting thy request
p68549
aVThat I despise thee for thy wrongful suit
p68550
aVAnd by and by intend to chide myself
p68551
aVEven for this time I spend in talking to thee
p68552
aVI grant sweet love that I did love a lady
p68553
aVBut she is dead
p68554
aV\u2019Twere false if I should speak it
p68555
aVFor I am sure she is not burièd
p68556
aVSay that she be yet Valentine thy friend
p68557
aVSurvives to whom thyself art witness
p68558
aVI am betrothed And art thou not ashamed
p68559
aVTo wrong him with thy importunacy

aVI likewise hear that Valentine is dead
p68561
aVAnd so suppose am I for in his grave
p68562
aVAssure thyself my love is burièd
p68563
aVSweet lady let me rake it from the earth
p68564
aVGo to thy lady\u2019s grave and call hers thence
p68565
aVOr at the least in hers sepulcher thine

aVHe heard not that
p68567
aVMadam if your heart be so obdurate
p68568
aVVouchsafe me yet your picture for my love
p68569
aVThe picture that is hanging in your chamber
p68570
aVTo that I\u2019ll speak to that I\u2019ll sigh and weep
p68571
aVFor since the substance of your perfect self
p68572
aVIs else devoted I am but a shadow
p68573
aVAnd to your shadow will I make true love
p68574
aVIf \u2019twere a substance you would sure deceive it
p68575
aVAnd make it but a shadow as I am
p68576
aVI am very loath to be your idol sir
p68577
aVBut since your falsehood shall become you well
p68578
aVTo worship shadows and adore false shapes
p68579
aVSend to me in the morning and I\u2019ll send it
p68580
aVAnd so good rest
p68581
aVAs wretches have o\u2019ernight
p68582
aVThat wait for execution in the morn
p68583
aVNot so but it hath been the longest night
p68584
aVThat e\u2019er I watched and the most heaviest
p68585
aVThis is the hour that Madam Sylvia
p68586
aVEntreated me to call and know her mind
p68587
aVThere\u2019s some great matter she\u2019d employ me in
p68588
aVMadam madam

aVVain Thurio whom my very soul abhorred
p68604
aVThyself hast loved and I have heard thee say
p68605
aVNo grief did ever come so near thy heart

aVTo bind him to remember my good will
p68682
aVAnd now am I unhappy messenger
p68683
aVTo plead for that which I would not obtain
p68684
aVTo carry that which I would have refused
p68685
aVTo praise his faith which I would have dispraised
p68686
aVI am my master\u2019s true confirmèd love
p68687
aVBut cannot be true servant to my master
p68688
aVUnless I prove false traitor to myself
p68689
aVYet will I woo for him but yet so coldly
p68690
aVAs Heaven it knows I would not have him speed
p68691
aVAs Sebastian Gentlewoman good day I pray you be my mean
p68692
aVTo bring me where to speak with Madam Sylvia
p68693
aVWhat would you with her if that I be she
p68694
aVIf you be she I do entreat your patience
p68695
aVTo hear me speak the message I am sent on
p68696
aVUrsula bring my picture there
p68697
aVGo give your master this Tell him from me
p68698
aVOne Julia that his changing thoughts forget
p68699
aVWould better fit his chamber than this shadow
p68700
aVMadam please you peruse this letter
p68701
aVPardon me madam I have unadvised
p68702
aVDelivered you a paper that I should not
p68703
aVThis is the letter to your Ladyship
p68704
aVI pray thee let me look on that again
p68705
aVIt may not be good madam pardon me
p68706
aVThere hold
p68707
aVI will not look upon your master\u2019s lines
p68708
aVI know they are stuffed with protestations
p68709
aVAnd full of new-found oaths which he will break
p68710
aVAs easily as I do tear his paper
p68711
aVMadam he sends your Ladyship this ring
p68712
aVThe more shame for him that he sends it me
p68713
aVFor I have heard him say a thousand times
p68714
aVHis Julia gave it him at his departure
p68715
aVThough his false finger have profaned the ring
p68716
aVMine shall not do his Julia so much wrong
p68717
aVShe thanks you
p68718
aVWhat sayst thou
p68719
aVI thank you madam that you tender her
p68720
aVPoor gentlewoman my master wrongs her much
p68721
aVDost thou know her
p68722
aVAlmost as well as I do know myself
p68723
aVTo think upon her woes I do protest
p68724
aVThat I have wept a hundred several times
p68725
aVBelike she thinks that Proteus hath forsook her
p68726
aVI think she doth and that\u2019s her cause of sorrow
p68727
aVIs she not passing fair
p68728
aVShe hath been fairer madam than she is
p68729
aVWhen she did think my master loved her well
p68730
aVShe in my judgment was as fair as you
p68731
aVBut since she did neglect her looking-glass
p68732
aVAnd threw her sun-expelling mask away
p68733
aVThe air hath starved the roses in her cheeks
p68734
aVAnd pinched the lily tincture of her face
p68735
aVThat now she is become as black as I
p68736
aVHow tall was she
p68737
aVAbout my stature for at Pentecost
p68738
aVWhen all our pageants of delight were played
p68739
aVOur youth got me to play the woman\u2019s part
p68740
aVAnd I was trimmed in Madam Julia\u2019s gown
p68741
aVWhich served me as fit by all men\u2019s judgments
p68742
aVAs if the garment had been made for me
p68743
aVTherefore I know she is about my height
p68744
aVAnd at that time I made her weep agood
p68745
aVFor I did play a lamentable part
p68746
aVMadam \u2019twas Ariadne passioning
p68747
aVFor Theseus\u2019 perjury and unjust flight
p68748
aVWhich I so lively acted with my tears
p68749
aVThat my poor mistress movèd therewithal
p68750
aVWept bitterly and would I might be dead
p68751
aVIf I in thought felt not her very sorrow
p68752
aVShe is beholding to thee gentle youth
p68753
aVAlas poor lady desolate and left
p68754
aVI weep myself to think upon thy words
p68755
aVHere youth there is my purse
p68756
aVI give thee this
p68757
aVFor thy sweet mistress\u2019 sake because thou lov\u2019st her
p68758
aVFarewell
p68759
aVAnd she shall thank you for \u2019t if e\u2019er you know her
p68760
aVA virtuous gentlewoman mild and beautiful
p68761
aVI hope my master\u2019s suit will be but cold
p68762
aVSince she respects my mistress\u2019 love so much
p68763
aVAlas how love can trifle with itself
p68764
aVHere is her picture let me see I think
p68765
aVIf I had such a tire this face of mine
p68766
aVWere full as lovely as is this of hers
p68767
aVAnd yet the painter flattered her a little
p68768
aVUnless I flatter with myself too much
p68769
aVHer hair is auburn mine is perfect yellow
p68770
aVIf that be all the difference in his love
p68771
aVI\u2019ll get me such a colored periwig
p68772
aVHer eyes are gray as glass and so are mine
p68773
aVAy but her forehead\u2019s low and mine\u2019s as high
p68774
aVWhat should it be that he respects in her
p68775
aVBut I can make respective in myself
p68776
aVIf this fond Love were not a blinded god
p68777
aVCome shadow come and take this shadow up
p68778
aVFor \u2019tis thy rival O thou senseless form
p68779
aVThou shalt be worshipped kissed loved and adored
p68780
aVAnd were there sense in his idolatry
p68781
aVMy substance should be statue in thy stead
p68782
aVI\u2019ll use thee kindly for thy mistress\u2019 sake
p68783
aVThat used me so or else by Jove I vow
p68784
aVI should have scratched out your unseeing eyes
p68785
aVTo make my master out of love with thee
p68786
aVThe sun begins to gild the western sky
p68787
aVAnd now it is about the very hour
p68788
aVThat Sylvia at Friar Patrick\u2019s cell should meet me
p68789
aVShe will not fail for lovers break not hours
p68790
aVUnless it be to come before their time
p68791
aVSo much they spur their expedition
p68792
aVSee where she comes Lady a happy evening
p68793
aVAmen amen Go on good Eglamour
p68794
aVOut at the postern by the abbey wall
p68795
aVI fear I am attended by some spies
p68796
aVFear not The forest is not three leagues off
p68797
aVIf we recover that we are sure enough
p68798
aVSir Proteus what says Sylvia to my suit
p68799
aVO sir I find her milder than she was
p68800
aVAnd yet she takes exceptions at your person
p68801
aVWhat That my leg is too long
p68802
aVNo that it is too little
p68803
aVI\u2019ll wear a boot to make it somewhat rounder
p68804
aVBut love will not be spurred to what it loathes
p68805
aVWhat says she to my face
p68806
aVShe says it is a fair one
p68807
aVNay then the wanton lies my face is black
p68808
aVBut pearls are fair and the old saying is
p68809
aVBlack men are pearls in beauteous ladies\u2019 eyes
p68810
aV\u2019Tis true such pearls as put out ladies\u2019 eyes
p68811
aVFor I had rather wink than look on them
p68812
aVHow likes she my discourse
p68813
aVIll when you talk of war
p68814
aVBut well when I discourse of love and peace
p68815
aVBut better indeed when you hold your peace
p68816
aVWhat says she to my valor
p68817
aVO sir she makes no doubt of that
p68818
aVShe needs not when she knows it cowardice
p68819
aVWhat says she to my birth
p68820
aVThat you are well derived
p68821
aVTrue from a gentleman to a fool
p68822
aVConsiders she my possessions
p68823
aVO ay and pities them
p68824
aVWherefore
p68825
aVThat such an ass should owe them
p68826
aVThat they are out by lease
p68827
aVHere comes the Duke
p68828
aVHow now Sir Proteus How now Thurio
p68829
aVWhich of you saw Eglamour of late
p68830
aVNot I
p68831
aVNor I
p68832
aVSaw you my daughter
p68833
aVNeither
p68834
aVWhy then she\u2019s fled unto that peasant Valentine
p68835
aVAnd Eglamour is in her company
p68836
aV\u2019Tis true for Friar Lawrence met them both
p68837
aVAs he in penance wandered through the forest
p68838
aVHim he knew well and guessed that it was she
p68839
aVBut being masked he was not sure of it
p68840
aVBesides she did intend confession
p68841
aVAt Patrick\u2019s cell this even and there she was not
p68842
aVThese likelihoods confirm her flight from hence
p68843
aVTherefore I pray you stand not to discourse
p68844
aVBut mount you presently and meet with me
p68845
aVUpon the rising of the mountain foot
p68846
aVThat leads toward Mantua whither they are fled
p68847
aVDispatch sweet gentlemen and follow me
p68848
aVWhy this it is to be a peevish girl
p68849
aVThat flies her fortune when it follows her
p68850
aVI\u2019ll after more to be revenged on Eglamour
p68851
aVThan for the love of reckless Sylvia
p68852
aVAnd I will follow more for Sylvia\u2019s love
p68853
aVThan hate of Eglamour that goes with her
p68854
aVAnd I will follow more to cross that love
p68855
aVThan hate for Sylvia that is gone for love
p68856
aVCome come be patient We must bring you to our captain
p68857
aVA thousand more mischances than this one
p68858
aVHave learned me how to brook this patiently
p68859
aVCome bring her away
p68860
aVWhere is the gentleman that was with her
p68861
aVBeing nimble-footed he hath outrun us
p68862
aVBut Moyses and Valerius follow him
p68863
aVGo thou with her to the west end of the wood
p68864
aVThere is our captain We\u2019ll follow him that\u2019s fled
p68865
aVThe thicket is beset he cannot \u2019scape
p68866
aVCome I must bring you to our captain\u2019s cave
p68867
aVFear not he bears an honorable mind
p68868
aVAnd will not use a woman lawlessly
p68869
aVO Valentine this I endure for thee
p68870
aVHow use doth breed a habit in a man
p68871
aVThis shadowy desert unfrequented woods
p68872
aVI better brook than flourishing peopled towns
p68873
aVHere can I sit alone unseen of any
p68874
aVAnd to the nightingale\u2019s complaining notes
p68875
aVTune my distresses and record my woes
p68876
aVO thou that dost inhabit in my breast
p68877
aVLeave not the mansion so long tenantless
p68878
aVLest growing ruinous the building fall
p68879
aVAnd leave no memory of what it was
p68880
aVRepair me with thy presence Sylvia
p68881
aVThou gentle nymph cherish thy forlorn swain
p68882
aVWhat hallowing and what stir is this today
p68883
aVThese are my mates that make their wills their law
p68884
aVHave some unhappy passenger in chase
p68885
aVThey love me well yet I have much to do
p68886
aVTo keep them from uncivil outrages
p68887
aVWithdraw thee Valentine Who\u2019s this comes here
p68888
aVMadam this service I have done for you
p68889
aVThough you respect not aught your servant doth
p68890
aVTo hazard life and rescue you from him
p68891
aVThat would have forced your honor and your love
p68892
aVVouchsafe me for my meed but one fair look
p68893
aVA smaller boon than this I cannot beg
p68894
aVAnd less than this I am sure you cannot give
p68895
aVHow like a dream is this I see and hear
p68896
aVLove lend me patience to forbear awhile
p68897
aVO miserable unhappy that I am
p68898
aVUnhappy were you madam ere I came
p68899
aVBut by my coming I have made you happy
p68900
aVBy thy approach thou mak\u2019st me most unhappy
p68901
aVAnd me when he approacheth to your presence
p68902
aVHad I been seizèd by a hungry lion
p68903
aVI would have been a breakfast to the beast
p68904
aVRather than have false Proteus rescue me
p68905
aVO heaven be judge how I love Valentine
p68906
aVWhose life\u2019s as tender to me as my soul
p68907
aVAnd full as much for more there cannot be
p68908
aVI do detest false perjured Proteus
p68909
aVTherefore begone solicit me no more
p68910
aVWhat dangerous action stood it next to death
p68911
aVWould I not undergo for one calm look
p68912
aVO \u2019tis the curse in love and still approved
p68913
aVWhen women cannot love where they\u2019re beloved
p68914
aVWhen Proteus cannot love where he\u2019s beloved
p68915
aVRead over Julia\u2019s heart thy first best love
p68916
aVFor whose dear sake thou didst then rend thy faith
p68917
aVInto a thousand oaths and all those oaths
p68918
aVDescended into perjury to love me
p68919
aVThou hast no faith left now unless thou \u2019dst two
p68920
aVAnd that\u2019s far worse than none better have none
p68921
aVThan plural faith which is too much by one
p68922
aVThou counterfeit to thy true friend
p68923
aVIn love
p68924
aVWho respects friend
p68925
aVAll men but Proteus

aVRuffian let go that rude uncivil touch
p68933
aVThou friend of an ill fashion
p68934
aVValentine
p68935
aVThou common friend that\u2019s without faith or love
p68936
aVFor such is a friend now Treacherous man
p68937
aVThou hast beguiled my hopes nought but mine eye
p68938
aVCould have persuaded me Now I dare not say
p68939
aVI have one friend alive thou wouldst disprove me
p68940
aVWho should be trusted when one\u2019s right hand
p68941
aVIs perjured to the bosom Proteus
p68942
aVI am sorry I must never trust thee more
p68943
aVBut count the world a stranger for thy sake
p68944
aVThe private wound is deepest O time most accursed
p68945
aV\u2019Mongst all foes that a friend should be the worst
p68946
aVMy shame and guilt confounds me
p68947
aVForgive me Valentine If hearty sorrow

aVWho by repentance is not satisfied
p68954
aVIs nor of heaven nor Earth for these are pleased
p68955
aVBy penitence th\u2019 Eternal\u2019s wrath\u2019s appeased

p68964
aVO cry you mercy sir I have mistook
p68965
aVThis is the ring you sent to Sylvia
p68966
aVBut how cam\u2019st thou by this ring At my depart
p68967
aVI gave this unto Julia
p68968
aVAnd Julia herself did give it me
p68969
aVAnd Julia herself hath brought it hither
p68970
aVHow Julia
p68971
aVBehold her that gave aim to all thy oaths
p68972
aVAnd entertained \u2019em deeply in her heart
p68973
aVHow oft hast thou with perjury cleft the root
p68974
aVO Proteus let this habit make thee blush
p68975
aVBe thou ashamed that I have took upon me
p68976
aVSuch an immodest raiment if shame live
p68977
aVIn a disguise of love
p68978
aVIt is the lesser blot modesty finds
p68979
aVWomen to change their shapes than men their minds
p68980
aVThan men their minds \u2019Tis true O heaven were man
p68981
aVBut constant he were perfect that one error
p68982
aVFills him with faults makes him run through all th\u2019 sins
p68983
aVInconstancy falls off ere it begins
p68984

aVMore fresh in Julia\u2019s with a constant eye
p68986

aVThey dance They are madwomen
p69365
aVLike madness is the glory of this life
p69366
aVAs this pomp shows to a little oil and root
p69367
aVWe make ourselves fools to disport ourselves
p69368
aVAnd spend our flatteries to drink those men
p69369
aVUpon whose age we void it up again
p69370
aVWith poisonous spite and envy
p69371
aVWho lives that\u2019s not depravèd or depraves
p69372
aVWho dies that bears not one spurn to their graves
p69373
aVOf their friends\u2019 gift

aVWhat will this come to
p69423
aVHe commands us to provide and give great gifts
p69424
aVAnd all out of an empty coffer
p69425
aVNor will he know his purse or yield me this
p69426
aVTo show him what a beggar his heart is
p69427
aVBeing of no power to make his wishes good
p69428
aVHis promises fly so beyond his state
p69429
aVThat what he speaks is all in debt he owes
p69430
aVFor ev\u2019ry word He is so kind that he
p69431
aVNow pays interest for \u2019t His land\u2019s put to their books

aVYou may take my word my lord I know no man

p69467
aVThat are given for \u2019em Friendship\u2019s full of dregs
p69468
aVMethinks false hearts should never have sound legs
p69469
aVThus honest fools lay out their wealth on court\u2019sies

aVOf raging waste It cannot hold it will not
p69478
aVIf I want gold steal but a beggar\u2019s dog

aVAsk nothing give it him it foals me straight
p69483
aVAnd able horses No porter at his gate

p69547
aVI\u2019ll wait upon you instantly
p69548
aVCome hither Pray you
p69549
aVHow goes the world that I am thus encountered
p69550
aVWith clamorous demands of debt broken bonds

aVAnd the detention of long-since-due debts
p69552
aVAgainst my honor
p69553
aVPlease you gentlemen
p69554
aVThe time is unagreeable to this business
p69555
aVYour importunacy cease till after dinner
p69556
aVThat I may make his Lordship understand

aVWherefore you are not paid

p69560
aVPray draw near
p69561
aVPray you walk near I\u2019ll speak with you anon
p69562
aVYou make me marvel wherefore ere this time
p69563
aVHad you not fully laid my state before me
p69564
aVThat I might so have rated my expense
p69565
aVAs I had leave of means
p69566
aVYou would not hear me
p69567
aVAt many leisures I proposed
p69568
aVGo to
p69569
aVPerchance some single vantages you took
p69570
aVWhen my indisposition put you back
p69571
aVAnd that unaptness made your minister
p69572
aVThus to excuse yourself
p69573
aVO my good lord
p69574
aVAt many times I brought in my accounts
p69575
aVLaid them before you You would throw them off
p69576
aVAnd say you found them in mine honesty
p69577
aVWhen for some trifling present you have bid me
p69578
aVReturn so much I have shook my head and wept
p69579
aVYea \u2019gainst th\u2019 authority of manners prayed you
p69580
aVTo hold your hand more close I did endure
p69581
aVNot seldom nor no slight checks when I have
p69582
aVPrompted you in the ebb of your estate
p69583
aVAnd your great flow of debts My lovèd lord
p69584
aVThough you hear now too late yet now\u2019s a time
p69585
aVThe greatest of your having lacks a half
p69586
aVTo pay your present debts
p69587
aVLet all my land be sold
p69588
aV\u2019Tis all engaged some forfeited and gone
p69589
aVAnd what remains will hardly stop the mouth
p69590
aVOf present dues The future comes apace
p69591
aVWhat shall defend the interim And at length
p69592
aVHow goes our reck\u2019ning
p69593
aVTo Lacedaemon did my land extend
p69594
aVO my good lord the world is but a word
p69595
aVWere it all yours to give it in a breath
p69596
aVHow quickly were it gone
p69597
aVYou tell me true
p69598
aVIf you suspect my husbandry of falsehood
p69599
aVCall me before th\u2019 exactest auditors
p69600
aVAnd set me on the proof So the gods bless me
p69601
aVWhen all our offices have been oppressed
p69602
aVWith riotous feeders when our vaults have wept
p69603
aVWith drunken spilth of wine when every room
p69604
aVHath blazed with lights and brayed with minstrelsy
p69605
aVI have retired me to a wasteful cock
p69606
aVAnd set mine eyes at flow
p69607
aVPrithee no more
p69608
aVHeavens have I said the bounty of this lord
p69609
aVHow many prodigal bits have slaves and peasants
p69610
aVThis night englutted Who is not Timon\u2019s
p69611
aVWhat heart head sword force means but is Lord Timon\u2019s
p69612
aVGreat Timon noble worthy royal Timon
p69613
aVAh when the means are gone that buy this praise
p69614
aVThe breath is gone whereof this praise is made
p69615
aVFeast-won fast-lost One cloud of winter showers
p69616
aVThese flies are couched
p69617
aVCome sermon me no further
p69618
aVNo villainous bounty yet hath passed my heart
p69619
aVUnwisely not ignobly have I given
p69620
aVWhy dost thou weep Canst thou the conscience lack
p69621
aVTo think I shall lack friends Secure thy heart
p69622
aVIf I would broach the vessels of my love
p69623
aVAnd try the argument of hearts by borrowing
p69624
aVMen and men\u2019s fortunes could I frankly use
p69625
aVAs I can bid thee speak
p69626
aVAssurance bless your thoughts
p69627
aVAnd in some sort these wants of mine are crowned
p69628
aVThat I account them blessings For by these
p69629
aVShall I try friends You shall perceive how you
p69630
aVMistake my fortunes I am wealthy in my friends
p69631
aVWithin there Flaminius Servilius
p69632
aVAs you have said my lord
p69633
aVLord Lucius and Lucullus Humh
p69634
aVGo you sir to the Senators
p69635
aVOf whom even to the state\u2019s best health I have
p69636
aVDeserved this hearing Bid \u2019em send o\u2019 th\u2019 instant
p69637
aVA thousand talents to me
p69638
aVI have been bold
p69639
aVFor that I knew it the most general way
p69640
aVTo them to use your signet and your name
p69641
aVBut they do shake their heads and I am here
p69642
aVNo richer in return
p69643
aVIs \u2019t true Can \u2019t be
p69644
aVThey answer in a joint and corporate voice
p69645
aVThat now they are at fall want treasure cannot
p69646
aVDo what they would are sorry You are honorable
p69647
aVBut yet they could have wished they know not
p69648
aVSomething hath been amiss a noble nature
p69649
aVMay catch a wrench would all were well \u2019tis pity
p69650
aVAnd so intending other serious matters
p69651
aVAfter distasteful looks and these hard fractions
p69652
aVWith certain half-caps and cold-moving nods
p69653
aVThey froze me into silence
p69654
aVYou gods reward them
p69655
aVPrithee man look cheerly These old fellows
p69656
aVHave their ingratitude in them hereditary
p69657
aVTheir blood is caked \u2019tis cold it seldom flows
p69658
aV\u2019Tis lack of kindly warmth they are not kind
p69659
aVAnd nature as it grows again toward earth
p69660
aVIs fashioned for the journey dull and heavy
p69661
aVGo to Ventidius Prithee be not sad
p69662
aVThou art true and honest ingeniously I speak
p69663
aVNo blame belongs to thee Ventidius lately
p69664
aVBuried his father by whose death he\u2019s stepped
p69665
aVInto a great estate When he was poor
p69666
aVImprisoned and in scarcity of friends
p69667
aVI cleared him with five talents Greet him from me
p69668
aVBid him suppose some good necessity
p69669
aVTouches his friend which craves to be remembered
p69670
aVWith those five talents That had give \u2019t these fellows
p69671
aVTo whom \u2019tis instant due Ne\u2019er speak or think
p69672
aVThat Timon\u2019s fortunes \u2019mong his friends can sink
p69673
aVI would I could not think it
p69674
aVThat thought is bounty\u2019s foe
p69675
aVBeing free itself it thinks all others so
p69676
aVIs \u2019t possible the world should so much differ
p69677
aVAnd we alive that lived Fly damnèd baseness
p69678
aVTo him that worships thee
p69679
aVMay these add to the number that may scald thee
p69680
aVLet molten coin be thy damnation
p69681
aVThou disease of a friend and not himself
p69682
aVHas friendship such a faint and milky heart
p69683
aVIt turns in less than two nights O you gods
p69684
aVI feel my master\u2019s passion This slave
p69685
aVUnto his honor has my lord\u2019s meat in him
p69686
aVWhy should it thrive and turn to nutriment
p69687
aVWhen he is turned to poison
p69688
aVO may diseases only work upon \u2019t
p69689
aVAnd when he\u2019s sick to death let not that part of nature
p69690
aVWhich my lord paid for be of any power
p69691
aVTo expel sickness but prolong his hour
p69692
aVI know his Lordship is but merry with me
p69693
aVHe cannot want fifty-five hundred talents
p69694
aVBut in the meantime he wants less my lord
p69695
aVIf his occasion were not virtuous
p69696
aVI should not urge it half so faithfully
p69697
aVDost thou speak seriously Servilius
p69698
aVUpon my soul \u2019tis true sir
p69699
aVYes sir I shall
p69700
aVTrue as you said Timon is shrunk indeed
p69701
aVAnd he that\u2019s once denied will hardly speed
p69702
aVDo you observe this Hostilius
p69703
aVAy too well
p69704
aVWhy this is the world\u2019s soul and just of the same piece
p69705
aVIs every flatterer\u2019s sport Who can call him his friend
p69706
aVThat dips in the same dish For in my knowing
p69707
aVTimon has been this lord\u2019s father
p69708
aVAnd kept his credit with his purse
p69709
aVSupported his estate nay Timon\u2019s money
p69710
aVHas paid his men their wages He ne\u2019er drinks
p69711
aVBut Timon\u2019s silver treads upon his lip
p69712
aVAnd yet O see the monstrousness of man
p69713
aVWhen he looks out in an ungrateful shape
p69714
aVHe does deny him in respect of his
p69715
aVWhat charitable men afford to beggars
p69716
aVReligion groans at it
p69717
aVFor mine own part
p69718
aVI never tasted Timon in my life
p69719
aVNor came any of his bounties over me
p69720
aVTo mark me for his friend Yet I protest
p69721
aVFor his right noble mind illustrious virtue
p69722
aVAnd honorable carriage
p69723
aVHad his necessity made use of me
p69724
aVI would have put my wealth into donation
p69725
aVAnd the best half should have returned to him
p69726
aVSo much I love his heart But I perceive
p69727
aVMen must learn now with pity to dispense
p69728
aVFor policy sits above conscience
p69729
aVMust he needs trouble me in \u2019t Hum \u2019Bove all others
p69730
aVHe might have tried Lord Lucius or Lucullus
p69731
aVAnd now Ventidius is wealthy too
p69732
aVWhom he redeemed from prison All these
p69733
aVOwes their estates unto him
p69734
aVMy lord
p69735
aVThey have all been touched and found base metal
p69736
aVFor they have all denied him
p69737
aVHow Have they denied him
p69738
aVHas Ventidius and Lucullus denied him
p69739
aVAnd does he send to me Three Humh
p69740
aVIt shows but little love or judgment in him
p69741
aVMust I be his last refuge His friends like physicians
p69742
aVThrive give him over Must I take th\u2019 cure upon me
p69743
aVHas much disgraced me in \u2019t I\u2019m angry at him
p69744
aVThat might have known my place I see no sense for \u2019t
p69745
aVBut his occasions might have wooed me first
p69746
aVFor in my conscience I was the first man
p69747
aVThat e\u2019er received gift from him
p69748
aVAnd does he think so backwardly of me now
p69749
aVThat I\u2019ll requite it last No
p69750
aVSo it may prove an argument of laughter
p69751
aVTo th\u2019 rest and I \u2019mongst lords be thought a fool
p69752
aVI\u2019d rather than the worth of thrice the sum
p69753
aVHad sent to me first but for my mind\u2019s sake
p69754
aVI\u2019d such a courage to do him good But now return
p69755
aVAnd with their faint reply this answer join
p69756
aVWho bates mine honor shall not know my coin
p69757
aVOf such a nature is his politic love
p69758
aVThis was my lord\u2019s best hope Now all are fled
p69759
aVSave only the gods Now his friends are dead
p69760
aVDoors that were ne\u2019er acquainted with their wards
p69761
aVMany a bounteous year must be employed
p69762
aVNow to guard sure their master
p69763
aVAnd this is all a liberal course allows
p69764
aVWho cannot keep his wealth must keep his house
p69765
aVWell met Good morrow Titus and Hortensius
p69766
aVThe like to you kind Varro
p69767
aVLucius
p69768
aVWhat do we meet together
p69769
aVAy and I think
p69770
aVOne business does command us all
p69771
aVFor mine is money
p69772
aVSo is theirs and ours
p69773
aVAnd sir Philotus\u2019 too
p69774
aVGood day at once
p69775
aVWelcome good brother
p69776
aVWhat do you think the hour
p69777
aVLaboring for nine
p69778
aVSo much
p69779
aVIs not my lord seen yet
p69780
aVNot yet
p69781
aVI wonder on \u2019t He was wont to shine at seven
p69782
aVAy but the days are waxed shorter with him
p69783
aVYou must consider that a prodigal course
p69784
aVIs like the sun\u2019s
p69785
aVBut not like his recoverable I fear
p69786
aV\u2019Tis deepest winter in Lord Timon\u2019s purse
p69787
aVThat is one may reach deep enough and yet
p69788
aVFind little
p69789
aVI am of your fear for that
p69790
aVI\u2019ll show you how t\u2019 observe a strange event
p69791
aVYour lord sends now for money
p69792
aVMost true he does
p69793
aVAnd he wears jewels now of Timon\u2019s gift
p69794
aVFor which I wait for money
p69795
aVIt is against my heart
p69796
aVMark how strange it shows
p69797
aVTimon in this should pay more than he owes
p69798
aVAnd e\u2019en as if your lord should wear rich jewels
p69799
aVAnd send for money for \u2019em
p69800
aVI\u2019m weary of this charge the gods can witness
p69801
aVI know my lord hath spent of Timon\u2019s wealth
p69802
aVAnd now ingratitude makes it worse than stealth
p69803
aVYes mine\u2019s three thousand crowns What\u2019s yours
p69804
aVFive thousand mine
p69805
aV\u2019Tis much deep and it should seem by th\u2019 sum
p69806
aVYour master\u2019s confidence was above mine
p69807
aVElse surely his had equaled
p69808
aVOne of Lord Timon\u2019s men
p69809
aVHa Is not that his steward muffled so
p69810
aVHe goes away in a cloud Call him call him
p69811
aVDo you hear sir
p69812
aVBy your leave sir
p69813
aVWhat do you ask of me my friend
p69814
aVWe wait for certain money here sir
p69815
aVAy
p69816
aVIf money were as certain as your waiting
p69817
aV\u2019Twere sure enough
p69818
aVWhy then preferred you not your sums and bills
p69819
aVWhen your false masters eat of my lord\u2019s meat
p69820
aVThen they could smile and fawn upon his debts
p69821
aVAnd take down th\u2019 int\u2019rest into their glutt\u2019nous maws
p69822
aVYou do yourselves but wrong to stir me up
p69823
aVLet me pass quietly
p69824
aVBelieve \u2019t my lord and I have made an end
p69825
aVI have no more to reckon he to spend
p69826
aVAy but this answer will not serve
p69827
aVIf \u2019twill not serve \u2019tis not so base as you
p69828
aVFor you serve knaves
p69829
aVMany do keep their chambers are not sick
p69830
aVAnd if it be so far beyond his health
p69831
aVMethinks he should the sooner pay his debts
p69832
aVAnd make a clear way to the gods
p69833
aVGood gods
p69834
aVWe cannot take this for answer sir
p69835
aVServilius help My lord my lord
p69836
aVWhat are my doors opposed against my passage
p69837
aVHave I been ever free and must my house
p69838
aVBe my retentive enemy my jail
p69839
aVThe place which I have feasted does it now
p69840
aVLike all mankind show me an iron heart
p69841
aVMy lord here is my bill
p69842
aVKnock me down with \u2019em Cleave me to the girdle
p69843
aVAlas my lord
p69844
aVCut my heart in sums
p69845
aVMine fifty talents
p69846
aVTell out my blood
p69847
aVFive thousand crowns my lord
p69848

p69873
aVHonor health and compassion to the Senate
p69874
aVNow captain
p69875
aVI am an humble suitor to your virtues
p69876
aVFor pity is the virtue of the law
p69877
aVAnd none but tyrants use it cruelly
p69878
aVIt pleases time and fortune to lie heavy
p69879
aVUpon a friend of mine who in hot blood
p69880
aVHath stepped into the law which is past depth
p69881
aVTo those that without heed do plunge into \u2019t
p69882
aVHe is a man setting his fate aside
p69883
aVOf comely virtues
p69884
aVNor did he soil the fact with cowardice
p69885
aVAn honor in him which buys out his fault
p69886
aVBut with a noble fury and fair spirit
p69887
aVSeeing his reputation touched to death
p69888
aVHe did oppose his foe
p69889
aVAnd with such sober and unnoted passion
p69890
aVHe did behave his anger ere \u2019twas spent
p69891
aVAs if he had but proved an argument
p69892
aVYou undergo too strict a paradox
p69893
aVStriving to make an ugly deed look fair
p69894
aVYour words have took such pains as if they labored
p69895
aVTo bring manslaughter into form and set quarreling
p69896
aVUpon the head of valor which indeed
p69897
aVIs valor misbegot and came into the world
p69898
aVWhen sects and factions were newly born
p69899
aVHe\u2019s truly valiant that can wisely suffer
p69900
aVThe worst that man can breathe
p69901
aVAnd make his wrongs his outsides
p69902
aVTo wear them like his raiment carelessly
p69903
aVAnd ne\u2019er prefer his injuries to his heart
p69904
aVTo bring it into danger
p69905
aVIf wrongs be evils and enforce us kill
p69906
aVWhat folly \u2019tis to hazard life for ill
p69907
aVMy lord
p69908
aVYou cannot make gross sins look clear
p69909
aVTo revenge is no valor but to bear
p69910
aVMy lords then under favor pardon me
p69911
aVIf I speak like a captain
p69912
aVWhy do fond men expose themselves to battle
p69913
aVAnd not endure all threats Sleep upon \u2019t
p69914
aVAnd let the foes quietly cut their throats
p69915
aVWithout repugnancy If there be
p69916
aVSuch valor in the bearing what make we
p69917
aVAbroad Why then women are more valiant
p69918
aVThat stay at home if bearing carry it
p69919
aVAnd the ass more captain than the lion the felon
p69920
aVLoaden with irons wiser than the judge
p69921
aVIf wisdom be in suffering O my lords
p69922
aVAs you are great be pitifully good
p69923
aVWho cannot condemn rashness in cold blood
p69924
aVTo kill I grant is sin\u2019s extremest gust
p69925
aVBut in defense by mercy \u2019tis most just
p69926
aVTo be in anger is impiety
p69927
aVBut who is man that is not angry
p69928
aVWeigh but the crime with this
p69929
aVYou breathe in vain
p69930
aVIn vain His service done
p69931
aVAt Lacedaemon and Byzantium
p69932
aVWere a sufficient briber for his life
p69933
aVWhat\u2019s that
p69934
aVWhy I say my lords has done fair service
p69935
aVAnd slain in fight many of your enemies
p69936
aVHow full of valor did he bear himself
p69937
aVIn the last conflict and made plenteous wounds
p69938
aVHe has made too much plenty with \u2019em
p69939
aVHe\u2019s a sworn rioter He has a sin
p69940
aVThat often drowns him and takes his valor prisoner
p69941
aVIf there were no foes that were enough
p69942
aVTo overcome him In that beastly fury
p69943
aVHe has been known to commit outrages
p69944
aVAnd cherish factions \u2019Tis inferred to us
p69945
aVHis days are foul and his drink dangerous
p69946
aVHe dies
p69947
aVHard fate He might have died in war
p69948
aVMy lords if not for any parts in him
p69949
aVThough his right arm might purchase his own time
p69950
aVAnd be in debt to none yet more to move you
p69951
aVTake my deserts to his and join \u2019em both
p69952
aVAnd for I know your reverend ages love
p69953
aVSecurity I\u2019ll pawn my victories all
p69954
aVMy honor to you upon his good returns
p69955
aVIf by this crime he owes the law his life
p69956
aVWhy let the war receive \u2019t in valiant gore
p69957
aVFor law is strict and war is nothing more
p69958
aVWe are for law He dies Urge it no more
p69959
aVOn height of our displeasure Friend or brother
p69960
aVHe forfeits his own blood that spills another
p69961
aVMust it be so It must not be

aVOn special dignities which vacant lie
p70708
aVFor thy best use and wearing
p70709
aVThey confess
p70710
aVToward thee forgetfulness too general gross
p70711
aVWhich now the public body which doth seldom
p70712
aVPlay the recanter feeling in itself
p70713
aVA lack of Timon\u2019s aid hath sense withal
p70714
aVOf it own fall restraining aid to Timon
p70715
aVAnd send forth us to make their sorrowed render
p70716
aVTogether with a recompense more fruitful
p70717

p70734
aVAnd shakes his threat\u2019ning sword
p70735
aVAgainst the walls of Athens
p70736
aVTherefore Timon

aVWell sir I will Therefore I will sir thus

p70742
aVGiving our holy virgins to the stain
p70743
aVOf contumelious beastly mad-brained war
p70744
aVThen let him know and tell him Timon speaks it
p70745
aVIn pity of our agèd and our youth
p70746
aVI cannot choose but tell him that I care not
p70747
aVAnd let him take \u2019t at worst for their knives care not

aVWhile you have throats to answer For myself
p70749
aVThere\u2019s not a whittle in th\u2019 unruly camp

aVFrom Alcibiades to Timon\u2019s cave
p70814
aVWith letters of entreaty which imported

p70837
aVAs slept within the shadow of your power
p70838
aVHave wandered with our traversed arms and breathed
p70839
aVOur sufferance vainly Now the time is flush
p70840
aVWhen crouching marrow in the bearer strong

aVTo wipe out our ingratitude with loves

aVThese walls of ours
p70857
aVWere not erected by their hands from whom
p70858
aVYou have received your grief nor are they such

aVThat these great towers trophies and schools should fall
p70860
aVFor private faults in them
p70861
aVNor are they living
p70862
aVWho were the motives that you first went out

aVAll have not offended
p70872
aVFor those that were it is not square to take
p70873
aVOn those that are revenge Crimes like lands

aVThan hew to \u2019t with thy sword
p70884
aVSet but thy foot
p70885
aVAgainst our rampired gates and they shall ope
p70886
aVSo thou wilt send thy gentle heart before

aVThrow thy glove
p70889
aVOr any token of thine honor else

aVI would not for a million of gold

aVFoul-spoken coward that thund\u2019rest with thy tongue
p71487
aVAnd with thy weapon nothing dar\u2019st perform
p71488
aVAway I say
p71489
aVNow by the gods that warlike Goths adore
p71490
aVThis petty brabble will undo us all
p71491
aVWhy lords and think you not how dangerous
p71492
aVIt is to jet upon a prince\u2019s right
p71493
aVWhat is Lavinia then become so loose
p71494
aVOr Bassianus so degenerate
p71495
aVThat for her love such quarrels may be broached
p71496
aVWithout controlment justice or revenge
p71497
aVYoung lords beware And should the Empress know
p71498
aVThis discord\u2019s ground the music would not please
p71499
aVI care not I knew she and all the world
p71500
aVI love Lavinia more than all the world
p71501
aVYoungling learn thou to make some meaner choice
p71502
aVLavinia is thine elder brother\u2019s hope
p71503
aVWhy are you mad Or know you not in Rome
p71504
aVHow furious and impatient they be
p71505
aVAnd cannot brook competitors in love
p71506
aVI tell you lords you do but plot your deaths
p71507
aVBy this device
p71508
aVAaron a thousand deaths
p71509
aVWould I propose to achieve her whom I love
p71510
aVTo achieve her how
p71511
aVWhy makes thou it so strange
p71512
aVShe is a woman therefore may be wooed
p71513
aVShe is a woman therefore may be won
p71514
aVShe is Lavinia therefore must be loved
p71515
aVWhat man more water glideth by the mill
p71516
aVThan wots the miller of and easy it is
p71517
aVOf a cut loaf to steal a shive we know
p71518
aVThough Bassianus be the Emperor\u2019s brother
p71519
aVBetter than he have worn Vulcan\u2019s badge
p71520
aVAy and as good as Saturninus may
p71521
aVThen why should he despair that knows to court it
p71522
aVWith words fair looks and liberality
p71523
aVWhat hast not thou full often struck a doe
p71524
aVAnd borne her cleanly by the keeper\u2019s nose
p71525
aVWhy then it seems some certain snatch or so
p71526
aVWould serve your turns
p71527
aVAy so the turn were served
p71528
aVAaron thou hast hit it
p71529
aVWould you had hit it too
p71530
aVThen should not we be tired with this ado
p71531
aVWhy hark you hark you And are you such fools
p71532
aVTo square for this Would it offend you then
p71533
aVThat both should speed
p71534
aVFaith not me
p71535
aVNor me so I were one
p71536
aVFor shame be friends and join for that you jar
p71537
aV\u2019Tis policy and stratagem must do
p71538
aVThat you affect and so must you resolve
p71539
aVThat what you cannot as you would achieve
p71540
aVYou must perforce accomplish as you may
p71541
aVTake this of me Lucrece was not more chaste
p71542
aVThan this Lavinia Bassianus\u2019 love
p71543
aVA speedier course than ling\u2019ring languishment
p71544
aVMust we pursue and I have found the path
p71545
aVMy lords a solemn hunting is in hand
p71546
aVThere will the lovely Roman ladies troop
p71547
aVThe forest walks are wide and spacious
p71548
aVAnd many unfrequented plots there are
p71549
aVFitted by kind for rape and villainy
p71550
aVSingle you thither then this dainty doe
p71551
aVAnd strike her home by force if not by words
p71552
aVThis way or not at all stand you in hope
p71553
aVCome come our empress with her sacred wit
p71554
aVTo villainy and vengeance consecrate
p71555
aVWill we acquaint withal what we intend
p71556
aVAnd she shall file our engines with advice
p71557
aVThat will not suffer you to square yourselves
p71558
aVBut to your wishes\u2019 height advance you both
p71559
aVThe Emperor\u2019s court is like the house of Fame
p71560
aVThe palace full of tongues of eyes and ears
p71561
aVThe woods are ruthless dreadful deaf and dull
p71562
aVThere speak and strike brave boys and take your turns
p71563
aVThere serve your lust shadowed from heaven\u2019s eye
p71564
aVAnd revel in Lavinia\u2019s treasury
p71565
aVThy counsel lad smells of no cowardice
p71566
aVSit fas aut nefas till I find the stream
p71567
aVTo cool this heat a charm to calm these fits
p71568
aVPer Stygia per manes vehor
p71569
aVThe hunt is up the moon is bright and gray
p71570
aVThe fields are fragrant and the woods are green
p71571
aVUncouple here and let us make a bay
p71572
aVAnd wake the Emperor and his lovely bride
p71573
aVAnd rouse the Prince and ring a hunter\u2019s peal
p71574
aVThat all the court may echo with the noise
p71575
aVSons let it be your charge as it is ours
p71576
aVTo attend the Emperor\u2019s person carefully
p71577
aVI have been troubled in my sleep this night
p71578
aVBut dawning day new comfort hath inspired
p71579
aVMany good morrows to your Majesty
p71580
aVMadam to you as many and as good
p71581
aVI promisèd your Grace a hunter\u2019s peal
p71582
aVAnd you have rung it lustily my lords
p71583
aVSomewhat too early for new-married ladies
p71584
aVLavinia how say you
p71585
aVI say no
p71586
aVI have been broad awake two hours and more
p71587
aVCome on then Horse and chariots let us have
p71588
aVAnd to our sport To Tamora Madam now shall you see
p71589
aVOur Roman hunting
p71590
aVI have dogs my lord
p71591
aVWill rouse the proudest panther in the chase
p71592
aVAnd climb the highest promontory top
p71593
aVAnd I have horse will follow where the game
p71594
aVMakes way and runs like swallows o\u2019er the plain
p71595
aVChiron we hunt not we with horse nor hound
p71596
aVBut hope to pluck a dainty doe to ground
p71597
aVHe that had wit would think that I had none
p71598
aVTo bury so much gold under a tree
p71599
aVAnd never after to inherit it
p71600
aVLet him that thinks of me so abjectly
p71601
aVKnow that this gold must coin a stratagem
p71602
aVWhich cunningly effected will beget
p71603
aVA very excellent piece of villainy
p71604
aVAnd so repose sweet gold for their unrest
p71605
aVThat have their alms out of the Empress\u2019 chest
p71606
aVMy lovely Aaron wherefore look\u2019st thou sad
p71607
aVWhen everything doth make a gleeful boast
p71608
aVThe birds chant melody on every bush
p71609
aVThe snakes lies rollèd in the cheerful sun
p71610
aVThe green leaves quiver with the cooling wind
p71611
aVAnd make a checkered shadow on the ground
p71612
aVUnder their sweet shade Aaron let us sit
p71613
aVAnd whilst the babbling echo mocks the hounds
p71614
aVReplying shrilly to the well-tuned horns
p71615
aVAs if a double hunt were heard at once
p71616
aVLet us sit down and mark their yellowing noise
p71617
aVAnd after conflict such as was supposed
p71618
aVThe wand\u2019ring prince and Dido once enjoyed
p71619
aVWhen with a happy storm they were surprised
p71620
aVAnd curtained with a counsel-keeping cave
p71621
aVWe may each wreathèd in the other\u2019s arms
p71622
aVOur pastimes done possess a golden slumber
p71623
aVWhiles hounds and horns and sweet melodious birds
p71624
aVBe unto us as is a nurse\u2019s song
p71625
aVOf lullaby to bring her babe asleep
p71626
aVMadam though Venus govern your desires
p71627
aVSaturn is dominator over mine
p71628
aVWhat signifies my deadly standing eye
p71629
aVMy silence and my cloudy melancholy
p71630
aVMy fleece of woolly hair that now uncurls
p71631
aVEven as an adder when she doth unroll
p71632
aVTo do some fatal execution
p71633
aVNo madam these are no venereal signs
p71634
aVVengeance is in my heart death in my hand
p71635
aVBlood and revenge are hammering in my head
p71636
aVHark Tamora the empress of my soul
p71637
aVWhich never hopes more heaven than rests in thee
p71638
aVThis is the day of doom for Bassianus
p71639
aVHis Philomel must lose her tongue today
p71640
aVThy sons make pillage of her chastity
p71641
aVAnd wash their hands in Bassianus\u2019 blood
p71642
aVSeest thou this letter Take it up I pray thee
p71643
aVAnd give the King this fatal-plotted scroll
p71644
aVNow question me no more We are espied
p71645
aVHere comes a parcel of our hopeful booty
p71646
aVWhich dreads not yet their lives\u2019 destruction
p71647
aVAh my sweet Moor sweeter to me than life
p71648
aVNo more great empress Bassianus comes
p71649
aVBe cross with him and I\u2019ll go fetch thy sons
p71650
aVTo back thy quarrels whatsoe\u2019er they be
p71651
aVWho have we here Rome\u2019s royal empress
p71652
aVUnfurnished of her well-beseeming troop
p71653
aVOr is it Dian habited like her
p71654
aVWho hath abandonèd her holy groves
p71655
aVTo see the general hunting in this forest
p71656
aVSaucy controller of my private steps
p71657
aVHad I the power that some say Dian had
p71658
aVThy temples should be planted presently
p71659
aVWith horns as was Acteon\u2019s and the hounds
p71660
aVShould drive upon thy new-transformèd limbs
p71661
aVUnmannerly intruder as thou art
p71662
aVUnder your patience gentle empress
p71663
aV\u2019Tis thought you have a goodly gift in horning
p71664
aVAnd to be doubted that your Moor and you
p71665
aVAre singled forth to try experiments
p71666
aVJove shield your husband from his hounds today
p71667
aV\u2019Tis pity they should take him for a stag
p71668
aVBelieve me queen your swarthy Cimmerian
p71669
aVDoth make your honor of his body\u2019s hue
p71670
aVSpotted detested and abominable
p71671
aVWhy are you sequestered from all your train
p71672
aVDismounted from your snow-white goodly steed
p71673
aVAnd wandered hither to an obscure plot
p71674
aVAccompanied but with a barbarous Moor
p71675
aVIf foul desire had not conducted you
p71676
aVAnd being intercepted in your sport
p71677
aVGreat reason that my noble lord be rated
p71678
aVFor sauciness I pray you let us hence
p71679
aVAnd let her joy her raven-colored love
p71680
aVThis valley fits the purpose passing well
p71681
aVThe King my brother shall have notice of this
p71682
aVAy for these slips have made him noted long
p71683
aVGood king to be so mightily abused
p71684
aVWhy I have patience to endure all this
p71685
aVHow now dear sovereign and our gracious mother
p71686
aVWhy doth your Highness look so pale and wan
p71687
aVHave I not reason think you to look pale
p71688
aVThese two have ticed me hither to this place
p71689
aVA barren detested vale you see it is
p71690
aVThe trees though summer yet forlorn and lean
p71691
aVOvercome with moss and baleful mistletoe
p71692
aVHere never shines the sun here nothing breeds
p71693
aVUnless the nightly owl or fatal raven
p71694
aVAnd when they showed me this abhorrèd pit
p71695
aVThey told me here at dead time of the night
p71696
aVA thousand fiends a thousand hissing snakes
p71697
aVTen thousand swelling toads as many urchins
p71698
aVWould make such fearful and confusèd cries
p71699
aVAs any mortal body hearing it
p71700
aVShould straight fall mad or else die suddenly
p71701
aVNo sooner had they told this hellish tale
p71702
aVBut straight they told me they would bind me here
p71703
aVUnto the body of a dismal yew
p71704
aVAnd leave me to this miserable death
p71705
aVAnd then they called me foul adulteress
p71706
aVLascivious Goth and all the bitterest terms
p71707
aVThat ever ear did hear to such effect
p71708
aVAnd had you not by wondrous fortune come
p71709
aVThis vengeance on me had they executed
p71710
aVRevenge it as you love your mother\u2019s life
p71711
aVOr be you not henceforth called my children
p71712
aVThis is a witness that I am thy son
p71713
aVAnd this for me struck home to show my strength
p71714
aVAy come Semiramis nay barbarous Tamora
p71715
aVFor no name fits thy nature but thy own
p71716
aVGive me the poniard You shall know my boys
p71717
aVYour mother\u2019s hand shall right your mother\u2019s wrong
p71718
aVStay madam here is more belongs to her
p71719
aVFirst thrash the corn then after burn the straw
p71720
aVThis minion stood upon her chastity
p71721
aVUpon her nuptial vow her loyalty
p71722
aVAnd with that painted hope braves your mightiness
p71723
aVAnd shall she carry this unto her grave
p71724
aVAnd if she do I would I were an eunuch
p71725
aVDrag hence her husband to some secret hole
p71726
aVAnd make his dead trunk pillow to our lust
p71727
aVBut when you have the honey you desire
p71728
aVLet not this wasp outlive us both to sting
p71729
aVI warrant you madam we will make that sure
p71730
aVCome mistress now perforce we will enjoy
p71731
aVThat nice-preservèd honesty of yours
p71732
aVO Tamora thou bearest a woman\u2019s face
p71733
aVI will not hear her speak Away with her
p71734
aVSweet lords entreat her hear me but a word
p71735
aVListen fair madam Let it be your glory
p71736
aVTo see her tears but be your heart to them
p71737
aVAs unrelenting flint to drops of rain
p71738
aVWhen did the tiger\u2019s young ones teach the dam
p71739
aVO do not learn her wrath she taught it thee
p71740
aVThe milk thou suck\u2019st from her did turn to marble
p71741
aVEven at thy teat thou hadst thy tyranny
p71742
aVYet every mother breeds not sons alike
p71743
aVTo Chiron Do thou entreat her show a woman\u2019s pity
p71744
aVWhat wouldst thou have me prove myself a bastard
p71745
aV\u2019Tis true the raven doth not hatch a lark
p71746
aVYet have I heard O could I find it now
p71747
aVThe lion moved with pity did endure
p71748
aVTo have his princely paws pared all away
p71749
aVSome say that ravens foster forlorn children
p71750
aVThe whilst their own birds famish in their nests
p71751
aVO be to me though thy hard heart say no
p71752
aVNothing so kind but something pitiful
p71753
aVI know not what it means Away with her
p71754
aVO let me teach thee For my father\u2019s sake
p71755
aVThat gave thee life when well he might have slain thee
p71756
aVBe not obdurate open thy deaf ears
p71757
aVHadst thou in person ne\u2019er offended me
p71758
aVEven for his sake am I pitiless
p71759
aVRemember boys I poured forth tears in vain
p71760
aVTo save your brother from the sacrifice
p71761
aVBut fierce Andronicus would not relent
p71762
aVTherefore away with her and use her as you will
p71763
aVThe worse to her the better loved of me
p71764
aVO Tamora be called a gentle queen
p71765
aVAnd with thine own hands kill me in this place
p71766
aVFor \u2019tis not life that I have begged so long
p71767
aVPoor I was slain when Bassianus died
p71768
aVWhat begg\u2019st thou then Fond woman let me go
p71769
aV\u2019Tis present death I beg and one thing more
p71770
aVThat womanhood denies my tongue to tell
p71771
aVO keep me from their worse-than-killing lust
p71772

p71773
aVWhere never man\u2019s eye may behold my body

aVMy sight is very dull whate\u2019er it bodes
p71792
aVAnd mine I promise you Were it not for shame

aVWhose mouth is covered with rude-growing briers
p71796
aVUpon whose leaves are drops of new-shed blood
p71797
aVAs fresh as morning dew distilled on flowers
p71798
aVA very fatal place it seems to me

aVThat ever eye with sight made heart lament

aVThat he thereby may have a likely guess
p71804
aVHow these were they that made away his brother
p71805
aVWhy dost not comfort me and help me out
p71806
aVFrom this unhallowed and bloodstainèd hole
p71807
aVI am surprisèd with an uncouth fear
p71808
aVA chilling sweat o\u2019erruns my trembling joints

aVMy heart suspects more than mine eye can see

aVTo prove thou hast a true-divining heart

aVLord Bassianus lies berayed in blood

aVAll on a heap like to a slaughtered lamb
p71820
aVIn this detested dark blood-drinking pit
p71821
aVIf it be dark how dost thou know \u2019tis he
p71822
aVUpon his bloody finger he doth wear
p71823
aVA precious ring that lightens all this hole
p71824
aVWhich like a taper in some monument
p71825
aVDoth shine upon the dead man\u2019s earthy cheeks
p71826
aVAnd shows the ragged entrails of this pit

aVO brother help me with thy fainting hand

aVSay who art thou that lately didst descend
p71845
aVInto this gaping hollow of the earth

aVThe unhappy sons of old Andronicus
p71847
aVBrought hither in a most unlucky hour
p71848
aVTo find thy brother Bassianus dead
p71849
aVMy brother dead I know thou dost but jest
p71850
aVHe and his lady both are at the lodge
p71851
aVUpon the north side of this pleasant chase

aVBut out alas here have we found him dead

aVWhere is my lord the King

aVWhere is thy brother Bassianus
p71858
aVNow to the bottom dost thou search my wound
p71859
aVPoor Bassianus here lies murderèd
p71860
aVThen all too late I bring this fatal writ
p71861
aVThe complot of this timeless tragedy
p71862
aVAnd wonder greatly that man\u2019s face can fold
p71863
aVIn pleasing smiles such murderous tyranny
p71864
aVAn if we miss to meet him handsomely
p71865
aVSweet huntsman Bassianus \u2019tis we mean
p71866
aVDo thou so much as dig the grave for him
p71867
aVThou know\u2019st our meaning Look for thy reward
p71868
aVAmong the nettles at the elder tree
p71869
aVWhich overshades the mouth of that same pit
p71870
aVWhere we decreed to bury Bassianus
p71871
aVDo this and purchase us thy lasting friends
p71872
aVO Tamora was ever heard the like
p71873
aVThis is the pit and this the elder tree

aVLook sirs if you can find the huntsman out

aVThat should have murdered Bassianus here
p71876
aVMy gracious lord here is the bag of gold
p71877
aVTwo of thy whelps fell curs of bloody kind
p71878
aVHave here bereft my brother of his life
p71879
aVSirs drag them from the pit unto the prison
p71880
aVThere let them bide until we have devised
p71881
aVSome never-heard-of torturing pain for them
p71882
aVWhat are they in this pit O wondrous thing
p71883
aVHow easily murder is discoverèd
p71884
aVHigh Emperor upon my feeble knee

aVIf it be proved You see it is apparent
p71889
aVWho found this letter Tamora was it you
p71890
aVAndronicus himself did take it up
p71891
aVI did my lord yet let me be their bail
p71892
aVFor by my father\u2019s reverend tomb I vow
p71893
aVThey shall be ready at your Highness\u2019 will
p71894
aVTo answer their suspicion with their lives
p71895
aVThou shalt not bail them See thou follow me
p71896
aVSome bring the murdered body some the murderers
p71897
aVLet them not speak a word The guilt is plain
p71898
aVFor by my soul were there worse end than death
p71899
aVThat end upon them should be executed
p71900
aVAndronicus I will entreat the King
p71901
aVFear not thy sons they shall do well enough
p71902
aVCome Lucius come Stay not to talk with them

p71908
aVGo home Call for sweet water wash thy hands
p71909
aVShe hath no tongue to call nor hands to wash
p71910
aVAnd so let\u2019s leave her to her silent walks
p71911
aVAn \u2019twere my cause I should go hang myself
p71912
aVIf thou hadst hands to help thee knit the cord
p71913
aVWho is this My niece that flies away so fast
p71914
aVCousin a word Where is your husband

aVIf I do dream would all my wealth would wake me
p71916
aVIf I do wake some planet strike me down
p71917
aVThat I may slumber an eternal sleep
p71918
aVSpeak gentle niece What stern ungentle hands
p71919
aVHath lopped and hewed and made thy body bare
p71920
aVOf her two branches those sweet ornaments
p71921
aVWhose circling shadows kings have sought to sleep in
p71922
aVAnd might not gain so great a happiness
p71923
aVAs half thy love Why dost not speak to me
p71924
aVAlas a crimson river of warm blood
p71925
aVLike to a bubbling fountain stirred with wind
p71926
aVDoth rise and fall between thy rosèd lips
p71927
aVComing and going with thy honey breath
p71928
aVBut sure some Tereus hath deflowered thee
p71929
aVAnd lest thou shouldst detect him cut thy tongue
p71930
aVAh now thou turn\u2019st away thy face for shame
p71931
aVAnd notwithstanding all this loss of blood
p71932
aVAs from a conduit with three issuing spouts
p71933
aVYet do thy cheeks look red as Titan\u2019s face
p71934
aVBlushing to be encountered with a cloud
p71935
aVShall I speak for thee shall I say \u2019tis so
p71936
aVO that I knew thy heart and knew the beast
p71937
aVThat I might rail at him to ease my mind
p71938
aVSorrow concealèd like an oven stopped
p71939
aVDoth burn the heart to cinders where it is
p71940
aVFair Philomela why she but lost her tongue
p71941
aVAnd in a tedious sampler sewed her mind
p71942
aVBut lovely niece that mean is cut from thee
p71943
aVA craftier Tereus cousin hast thou met
p71944
aVAnd he hath cut those pretty fingers off
p71945
aVThat could have better sewed than Philomel
p71946
aVO had the monster seen those lily hands
p71947
aVTremble like aspen leaves upon a lute
p71948
aVAnd make the silken strings delight to kiss them
p71949
aVHe would not then have touched them for his life
p71950
aVOr had he heard the heavenly harmony
p71951
aVWhich that sweet tongue hath made
p71952
aVHe would have dropped his knife and fell asleep
p71953
aVAs Cerberus at the Thracian poet\u2019s feet
p71954
aVCome let us go and make thy father blind
p71955
aVFor such a sight will blind a father\u2019s eye
p71956
aVOne hour\u2019s storm will drown the fragrant meads
p71957
aVWhat will whole months of tears thy father\u2019s eyes
p71958
aVDo not draw back for we will mourn with thee
p71959
aVO could our mourning ease thy misery
p71960
aVHear me grave fathers noble tribunes stay
p71961
aVFor pity of mine age whose youth was spent
p71962
aVIn dangerous wars whilst you securely slept
p71963
aVFor all my blood in Rome\u2019s great quarrel shed
p71964
aVFor all the frosty nights that I have watched
p71965
aVAnd for these bitter tears which now you see
p71966
aVFilling the agèd wrinkles in my cheeks
p71967
aVBe pitiful to my condemnèd sons
p71968
aVWhose souls is not corrupted as \u2019tis thought
p71969
aVFor two-and-twenty sons I never wept
p71970
aVBecause they died in honor\u2019s lofty bed
p71971
aVFor these tribunes in the dust I write
p71972
aVMy heart\u2019s deep languor and my soul\u2019s sad tears
p71973
aVLet my tears stanch the earth\u2019s dry appetite
p71974
aVMy sons\u2019 sweet blood will make it shame and blush
p71975
aVO Earth I will befriend thee more with rain
p71976
aVThat shall distil from these two ancient ruins
p71977
aVThan youthful April shall with all his showers
p71978
aVIn summer\u2019s drought I\u2019ll drop upon thee still
p71979
aVIn winter with warm tears I\u2019ll melt the snow
p71980
aVAnd keep eternal springtime on thy face
p71981
aVSo thou refuse to drink my dear sons\u2019 blood
p71982
aVO reverend tribunes O gentle agèd men
p71983
aVUnbind my sons reverse the doom of death
p71984
aVAnd let me say that never wept before
p71985
aVMy tears are now prevailing orators
p71986
aVO noble father you lament in vain
p71987
aVThe Tribunes hear you not no man is by
p71988
aVAnd you recount your sorrows to a stone
p71989
aVAh Lucius for thy brothers let me plead
p71990
aVGrave tribunes once more I entreat of you
p71991
aVMy gracious lord no tribune hears you speak
p71992
aVWhy \u2019tis no matter man If they did hear
p71993
aVThey would not mark me if they did mark
p71994
aVThey would not pity me Yet plead I must
p71995
aVAnd bootless unto them
p71996
aVTherefore I tell my sorrows to the stones
p71997
aVWho though they cannot answer my distress
p71998
aVYet in some sort they are better than the Tribunes
p71999
aVFor that they will not intercept my tale
p72000
aVWhen I do weep they humbly at my feet
p72001
aVReceive my tears and seem to weep with me
p72002
aVAnd were they but attirèd in grave weeds
p72003
aVRome could afford no tribunes like to these
p72004
aVA stone is soft as wax tribunes more hard than stones
p72005
aVA stone is silent and offendeth not
p72006
aVAnd tribunes with their tongues doom men to death
p72007
aVBut wherefore stand\u2019st thou with thy weapon drawn
p72008
aVTo rescue my two brothers from their death
p72009
aVFor which attempt the Judges have pronounced
p72010
aVMy everlasting doom of banishment
p72011
aVO happy man they have befriended thee
p72012
aVWhy foolish Lucius dost thou not perceive
p72013
aVThat Rome is but a wilderness of tigers
p72014
aVTigers must prey and Rome affords no prey
p72015
aVBut me and mine How happy art thou then
p72016
aVFrom these devourers to be banishèd
p72017
aVBut who comes with our brother Marcus here
p72018
aVTitus prepare thy agèd eyes to weep
p72019
aVOr if not so thy noble heart to break
p72020
aVI bring consuming sorrow to thine age
p72021
aVWill it consume me Let me see it then
p72022
aVThis was thy daughter
p72023
aVWhy Marcus so she is
p72024
aVAy me this object kills me
p72025
aVFaint-hearted boy arise and look upon her
p72026
aVSpeak Lavinia What accursèd hand
p72027
aVHath made thee handless in thy father\u2019s sight
p72028
aVWhat fool hath added water to the sea
p72029
aVOr brought a faggot to bright-burning Troy
p72030
aVMy grief was at the height before thou cam\u2019st
p72031
aVAnd now like Nilus it disdaineth bounds
p72032
aVGive me a sword I\u2019ll chop off my hands too
p72033
aVFor they have fought for Rome and all in vain
p72034
aVAnd they have nursed this woe in feeding life
p72035
aVIn bootless prayer have they been held up
p72036
aVAnd they have served me to effectless use
p72037
aVNow all the service I require of them
p72038
aVIs that the one will help to cut the other
p72039
aV\u2019Tis well Lavinia that thou hast no hands
p72040
aVFor hands to do Rome service is but vain
p72041
aVSpeak gentle sister Who hath martyred thee
p72042
aVO that delightful engine of her thoughts
p72043
aVThat blabbed them with such pleasing eloquence
p72044
aVIs torn from forth that pretty hollow cage
p72045
aVWhere like a sweet melodious bird it sung
p72046
aVSweet varied notes enchanting every ear
p72047
aVO say thou for her who hath done this deed
p72048
aVO thus I found her straying in the park
p72049
aVSeeking to hide herself as doth the deer
p72050
aVThat hath received some unrecuring wound
p72051
aVIt was my dear and he that wounded her
p72052
aVHath hurt me more than had he killed me dead
p72053
aVFor now I stand as one upon a rock
p72054
aVEnvironed with a wilderness of sea
p72055
aVWho marks the waxing tide grow wave by wave
p72056
aVExpecting ever when some envious surge
p72057
aVWill in his brinish bowels swallow him
p72058
aVThis way to death my wretched sons are gone
p72059
aVHere stands my other son a banished man
p72060
aVAnd here my brother weeping at my woes
p72061
aVBut that which gives my soul the greatest spurn
p72062
aVIs dear Lavinia dearer than my soul
p72063
aVHad I but seen thy picture in this plight
p72064
aVIt would have madded me What shall I do
p72065
aVNow I behold thy lively body so
p72066
aVThou hast no hands to wipe away thy tears
p72067
aVNor tongue to tell me who hath martyred thee
p72068
aVThy husband he is dead and for his death
p72069
aVThy brothers are condemned and dead by this
p72070
aVLook Marcus Ah son Lucius look on her
p72071
aVWhen I did name her brothers then fresh tears
p72072
aVStood on her cheeks as doth the honeydew
p72073
aVUpon a gathered lily almost withered
p72074
aVPerchance she weeps because they killed her husband
p72075
aVPerchance because she knows them innocent
p72076
aVIf they did kill thy husband then be joyful
p72077
aVBecause the law hath ta\u2019en revenge on them
p72078
aVNo no they would not do so foul a deed
p72079
aVWitness the sorrow that their sister makes
p72080
aVGentle Lavinia let me kiss thy lips
p72081
aVOr make some sign how I may do thee ease
p72082
aVShall thy good uncle and thy brother Lucius
p72083
aVAnd thou and I sit round about some fountain
p72084
aVLooking all downwards to behold our cheeks
p72085
aVHow they are stained like meadows yet not dry
p72086
aVWith miry slime left on them by a flood
p72087
aVAnd in the fountain shall we gaze so long
p72088
aVTill the fresh taste be taken from that clearness
p72089
aVAnd made a brine pit with our bitter tears
p72090
aVOr shall we cut away our hands like thine
p72091
aVOr shall we bite our tongues and in dumb shows
p72092
aVPass the remainder of our hateful days
p72093
aVWhat shall we do Let us that have our tongues
p72094
aVPlot some device of further misery
p72095
aVTo make us wondered at in time to come
p72096
aVSweet father cease your tears for at your grief
p72097
aVSee how my wretched sister sobs and weeps
p72098
aVPatience dear niece Good Titus dry thine eyes
p72099
aVAh Marcus Marcus Brother well I wot
p72100
aVThy napkin cannot drink a tear of mine
p72101
aVFor thou poor man hast drowned it with thine own
p72102
aVAh my Lavinia I will wipe thy cheeks
p72103
aVMark Marcus mark I understand her signs
p72104
aVHad she a tongue to speak now would she say
p72105
aVThat to her brother which I said to thee
p72106
aVHis napkin with his true tears all bewet
p72107
aVCan do no service on her sorrowful cheeks
p72108
aVO what a sympathy of woe is this
p72109
aVAs far from help as limbo is from bliss
p72110
aVTitus Andronicus my lord the Emperor
p72111
aVSends thee this word that if thou love thy sons
p72112
aVLet Marcus Lucius or thyself old Titus
p72113
aVOr any one of you chop off your hand
p72114
aVAnd send it to the King he for the same
p72115
aVWill send thee hither both thy sons alive
p72116
aVAnd that shall be the ransom for their fault
p72117
aVO gracious emperor O gentle Aaron
p72118
aVDid ever raven sing so like a lark
p72119
aVThat gives sweet tidings of the sun\u2019s uprise
p72120
aVWith all my heart I\u2019ll send the Emperor my hand
p72121
aVGood Aaron wilt thou help to chop it off
p72122
aVStay father for that noble hand of thine
p72123
aVThat hath thrown down so many enemies
p72124
aVShall not be sent My hand will serve the turn
p72125
aVMy youth can better spare my blood than you
p72126
aVAnd therefore mine shall save my brothers\u2019 lives
p72127
aVWhich of your hands hath not defended Rome
p72128
aVAnd reared aloft the bloody battleax
p72129
aVWriting destruction on the enemy\u2019s castle
p72130
aVO none of both but are of high desert
p72131
aVMy hand hath been but idle let it serve

aVNow let me show a brother\u2019s love to thee
p72144
aVAgree between you I will spare my hand
p72145
aVThen I\u2019ll go fetch an ax
p72146
aVBut I will use the ax
p72147
aVCome hither Aaron I\u2019ll deceive them both

aVAnd feed his humor kindly as we may
p72687
aVTill time beget some careful remedy
p72688
aVKinsmen his sorrows are past remedy
p72689
aVBut

aVJoin with the Goths and with revengeful war
p72691

aVThis was the sport my lord when Publius shot
p72728
aVThe Bull being galled gave Aries such a knock
p72729
aVThat down fell both the Ram\u2019s horns in the court
p72730
aVAnd who should find them but the Empress\u2019 villain
p72731
aVShe laughed and told the Moor he should not choose

p72749
aVOf equal justice used in such contempt
p72750
aVMy lords you know as know the mightful gods
p72751
aVHowever these disturbers of our peace
p72752
aVBuzz in the people\u2019s ears there naught hath passed
p72753
aVBut even with law against the willful sons
p72754
aVOf old Andronicus And what an if
p72755
aVHis sorrows have so overwhelmed his wits
p72756
aVShall we be thus afflicted in his wreaks
p72757
aVHis fits his frenzy and his bitterness
p72758
aVAnd now he writes to heaven for his redress
p72759
aVSee here\u2019s to Jove and this to Mercury
p72760
aVThis to Apollo this to the god of war
p72761
aVSweet scrolls to fly about the streets of Rome
p72762
aVWhat\u2019s this but libeling against the Senate
p72763
aVAnd blazoning our unjustice everywhere
p72764
aVA goodly humor is it not my lords
p72765
aVAs who would say in Rome no justice were
p72766
aVBut if I live his feignèd ecstasies
p72767
aVShall be no shelter to these outrages
p72768
aVBut he and his shall know that justice lives
p72769
aVIn Saturninus\u2019 health whom if he sleep

aVHe\u2019ll so awake as he in fury shall
p72771
aVCut off the proud\u2019st conspirator that lives
p72772
aVMy gracious lord my lovely Saturnine

aVCalm thee and bear the faults of Titus\u2019 age
p72775
aVTh\u2019 effects of sorrow for his valiant sons
p72776
aVWhose loss hath pierced him deep and scarred his heart
p72777
aVAnd rather comfort his distressèd plight
p72778
aVThan prosecute the meanest or the best
p72779
aVFor these contempts Aside Why thus it shall become
p72780
aVHigh-witted Tamora to gloze with all
p72781
aVBut Titus I have touched thee to the quick
p72782
aVThy lifeblood out if Aaron now be wise
p72783
aVThen is all safe the anchor in the port
p72784
aVHow now good fellow wouldst thou speak with us
p72785
aVEmpress I am but yonder sits the Emperor
p72786
aVGo take him away and hang him presently
p72787
aVDespiteful and intolerable wrongs
p72788
aVShall I endure this monstrous villainy
p72789
aVI know from whence this same device proceeds
p72790
aVMay this be borne as if his traitorous sons
p72791
aVThat died by law for murder of our brother
p72792
aVHave by my means been butchered wrongfully
p72793
aVGo drag the villain hither by the hair
p72794
aVNor age nor honor shall shape privilege
p72795
aVFor this proud mock I\u2019ll be thy slaughterman
p72796
aVSly frantic wretch that holp\u2019st to make me great
p72797
aVIn hope thyself should govern Rome and me
p72798
aVWhat news with thee Aemilius
p72799
aVArm my lords Rome never had more cause
p72800
aVThe Goths have gathered head and with a power
p72801
aVOf high-resolvèd men bent to the spoil
p72802
aVThey hither march amain under conduct
p72803
aVOf Lucius son to old Andronicus
p72804
aVWho threats in course of this revenge to do
p72805
aVAs much as ever Coriolanus did
p72806
aVIs warlike Lucius general of the Goths
p72807
aVThese tidings nip me and I hang the head
p72808
aVAs flowers with frost or grass beat down with storms
p72809
aVAy now begins our sorrows to approach
p72810
aV\u2019Tis he the common people love so much
p72811
aVMyself hath often heard them say
p72812
aVWhen I have walkèd like a private man
p72813
aVThat Lucius\u2019 banishment was wrongfully
p72814
aVAnd they have wished that Lucius were their emperor
p72815
aVWhy should you fear Is not your city strong
p72816
aVAy but the citizens favor Lucius
p72817
aVAnd will revolt from me to succor him
p72818
aVKing be thy thoughts imperious like thy name
p72819
aVIs the sun dimmed that gnats do fly in it
p72820
aVThe eagle suffers little birds to sing
p72821
aVAnd is not careful what they mean thereby
p72822
aVKnowing that with the shadow of his wings
p72823
aVHe can at pleasure stint their melody
p72824
aVEven so mayst thou the giddy men of Rome
p72825
aVThen cheer thy spirit for know thou emperor
p72826
aVI will enchant the old Andronicus
p72827
aVWith words more sweet and yet more dangerous
p72828
aVThan baits to fish or honey-stalks to sheep
p72829
aVWhenas the one is wounded with the bait
p72830
aVThe other rotted with delicious feed
p72831
aVBut he will not entreat his son for us
p72832
aVIf Tamora entreat him then he will
p72833
aVFor I can smooth and fill his agèd ears
p72834
aVWith golden promises that were his heart
p72835
aVAlmost impregnable his old ears deaf
p72836
aVYet should both ear and heart obey my tongue
p72837
aVTo Aemilius Go thou before to be our ambassador
p72838
aVSay that the Emperor requests a parley
p72839
aVOf warlike Lucius and appoint the meeting
p72840
aVEven at his father\u2019s house the old Andronicus
p72841
aVAemilius do this message honorably
p72842
aVAnd if he stand in hostage for his safety
p72843
aVBid him demand what pledge will please him best
p72844
aVYour bidding shall I do effectually
p72845
aVNow will I to that old Andronicus
p72846
aVAnd temper him with all the art I have
p72847
aVTo pluck proud Lucius from the warlike Goths
p72848
aVAnd now sweet emperor be blithe again
p72849
aVAnd bury all thy fear in my devices
p72850
aVThen go successantly and plead to him
p72851
aVApprovèd warriors and my faithful friends
p72852
aVI have receivèd letters from great Rome
p72853
aVWhich signifies what hate they bear their emperor
p72854
aVAnd how desirous of our sight they are
p72855
aVTherefore great lords be as your titles witness
p72856
aVImperious and impatient of your wrongs
p72857
aVAnd wherein Rome hath done you any scathe
p72858
aVLet him make treble satisfaction
p72859
aVBrave slip sprung from the great Andronicus
p72860
aVWhose name was once our terror now our comfort
p72861
aVWhose high exploits and honorable deeds
p72862
aVIngrateful Rome requites with foul contempt
p72863
aVBe bold in us We\u2019ll follow where thou lead\u2019st
p72864
aVLike stinging bees in hottest summer\u2019s day
p72865
aVLed by their master to the flowered fields
p72866
aVAnd be avenged on cursèd Tamora
p72867
aVAnd as he saith so say we all with him
p72868
aVI humbly thank him and I thank you all
p72869
aVBut who comes here led by a lusty Goth
p72870
aVRenownèd Lucius from our troops I strayed
p72871
aVTo gaze upon a ruinous monastery
p72872
aVAnd as I earnestly did fix mine eye
p72873
aVUpon the wasted building suddenly
p72874
aVI heard a child cry underneath a wall
p72875
aVI made unto the noise when soon I heard
p72876
aVThe crying babe controlled with this discourse
p72877
aVPeace tawny slave half me and half thy dame
p72878
aVDid not thy hue bewray whose brat thou art
p72879
aVHad nature lent thee but thy mother\u2019s look
p72880
aVVillain thou mightst have been an emperor
p72881
aVBut where the bull and cow are both milk white
p72882
aVThey never do beget a coal-black calf
p72883
aVPeace villain peace even thus he rates the babe
p72884
aVFor I must bear thee to a trusty Goth
p72885
aVWho when he knows thou art the Empress\u2019 babe
p72886
aVWill hold thee dearly for thy mother\u2019s sake
p72887
aVWith this my weapon drawn I rushed upon him
p72888
aVSurprised him suddenly and brought him hither
p72889
aVTo use as you think needful of the man
p72890
aVO worthy Goth this is the incarnate devil
p72891
aVThat robbed Andronicus of his good hand
p72892
aVThis is the pearl that pleased your empress\u2019 eye
p72893
aVAnd here\u2019s the base fruit of her burning lust
p72894
aVSay wall-eyed slave whither wouldst thou convey
p72895
aVThis growing image of thy fiendlike face
p72896
aVWhy dost not speak What deaf Not a word
p72897
aVA halter soldiers Hang him on this tree
p72898
aVAnd by his side his fruit of bastardy
p72899
aVTouch not the boy He is of royal blood
p72900
aVToo like the sire for ever being good
p72901
aVFirst hang the child that he may see it sprawl
p72902
aVA sight to vex the father\u2019s soul withal
p72903
aVGet me a ladder
p72904
aVLucius save the child
p72905
aVAnd bear it from me to the Empress
p72906
aVIf thou do this I\u2019ll show thee wondrous things
p72907
aVThat highly may advantage thee to hear
p72908

p72941
aVTo that which thou shalt hear of me anon
p72942
aV\u2019Twas her two sons that murdered Bassianus
p72943
aVThey cut thy sister\u2019s tongue and ravished her
p72944
aVAnd cut her hands and trimmed her as thou sawest
p72945
aVO detestable villain call\u2019st thou that trimming

p72947
aVTrim sport for them which had the doing of it
p72948
aVO barbarous beastly villains like thyself
p72949
aVIndeed I was their tutor to instruct them
p72950
aVThat codding spirit had they from their mother
p72951
aVAs sure a card as ever won the set
p72952
aVThat bloody mind I think they learned of me
p72953
aVAs true a dog as ever fought at head
p72954
aVWell let my deeds be witness of my worth

p72958
aVAnd hid the gold within that letter mentioned
p72959
aVConfederate with the Queen and her two sons
p72960
aVAnd what not done that thou hast cause to rue
p72961
aVWherein I had no stroke of mischief in it
p72962
aVI played the cheater for thy father\u2019s hand
p72963
aVAnd when I had it drew myself apart
p72964
aVAnd almost broke my heart with extreme laughter
p72965
aVI pried me through the crevice of a wall
p72966
aVWhen for his hand he had his two sons\u2019 heads
p72967
aVBeheld his tears and laughed so heartily
p72968
aVThat both mine eyes were rainy like to his
p72969
aVAnd when I told the Empress of this sport
p72970
aVShe sounded almost at my pleasing tale
p72971
aVAnd for my tidings gave me twenty kisses
p72972
aVWhat canst thou say all this and never blush
p72973

aVSet fire on barns and haystalks in the night
p72985
aVAnd bid the owners quench them with their tears
p72986
aVOft have I digged up dead men from their graves
p72987
aVAnd set them upright at their dear friends\u2019 door
p72988

aVThe winds did sing it to me and the thunder
p74588

aVThe name of Prosper It did bass my trespass
p74590
aVTherefor my son i\u2019 th\u2019 ooze is bedded and

p74794
aVAt which like unbacked colts they pricked their ears
p74795
aVAdvanced their eyelids lifted up their noses
p74796
aVAs they smelt music So I charmed their ears
p74797
aVThat calf-like they my lowing followed through

aVOn the sixth hour at which time my lord
p74848
aVYou said our work should cease

aVI did say so
p74850
aVWhen first I raised the tempest Say my spirit
p74851
aVHow fares the King and \u2019s followers
p74852
aVConfined together
p74853
aVIn the same fashion as you gave in charge
p74854
aVJust as you left them all prisoners sir
p74855
aVIn the line grove which weather-fends your cell
p74856
aVThey cannot budge till your release The King
p74857
aVHis brother and yours abide all three distracted
p74858
aVAnd the remainder mourning over them
p74859
aVBrimful of sorrow and dismay but chiefly
p74860
aVHim that you termed sir the good old Lord Gonzalo
p74861
aVHis tears runs down his beard like winter\u2019s drops
p74862
aVFrom eaves of reeds Your charm so strongly works \u2019em
p74863
aVThat if you now beheld them your affections
p74864
aVWould become tender
p74865
aVDost thou think so spirit

aVMine would sir were I human

aVOne of their kind that relish all as sharply

aVPassion as they be kindlier moved than thou art
p74872
aVThough with their high wrongs I am struck to th\u2019 quick
p74873
aVYet with my nobler reason \u2019gainst my fury
p74874
aVDo I take part The rarer action is
p74875
aVIn virtue than in vengeance They being penitent
p74876
aVThe sole drift of my purpose doth extend
p74877
aVNot a frown further Go release them Ariel
p74878
aVMy charms I\u2019ll break their senses I\u2019ll restore
p74879
aVAnd they shall be themselves

aVI\u2019ll fetch them sir
p74881
aVYou elves of hills brooks standing lakes and groves
p74882
aVAnd you that on the sands with printless foot
p74883
aVDo chase the ebbing Neptune and do fly him
p74884
aVWhen he comes back you demi-puppets that
p74885
aVBy moonshine do the green sour ringlets make
p74886
aVWhereof the ewe not bites and you whose pastime

aVIs to make midnight mushrumps that rejoice
p74888
aVTo hear the solemn curfew by whose aid
p74889
aVWeak masters though you be I have bedimmed
p74890
aVThe noontide sun called forth the mutinous winds
p74891
aVAnd \u2019twixt the green sea and the azured vault
p74892
aVSet roaring war to the dread rattling thunder
p74893
aVHave I given fire and rifted Jove\u2019s stout oak
p74894
aVWith his own bolt the strong-based promontory
p74895
aVHave I made shake and by the spurs plucked up
p74896
aVThe pine and cedar graves at my command
p74897
aVHave waked their sleepers oped and let \u2019em forth
p74898
aVBy my so potent art But this rough magic
p74899
aVI here abjure and when I have required
p74900
aVSome heavenly music which even now I do
p74901
aVTo work mine end upon their senses that
p74902
aVThis airy charm is for I\u2019ll break my staff
p74903
aVBury it certain fathoms in the earth
p74904
aVAnd deeper than did ever plummet sound
p74905
aVI\u2019ll drown my book
p74906
aVA solemn air and the best comforter

aVTo an unsettled fancy cure thy brains

aVHoly Gonzalo honorable man
p74911
aVMine eyes e\u2019en sociable to the show of thine
p74912
aVFall fellowly drops The charm dissolves apace
p74913
aVAnd as the morning steals upon the night

aVMelting the darkness so their rising senses
p74915
aVBegin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle
p74916
aVTheir clearer reason O good Gonzalo
p74917
aVMy true preserver and a loyal sir
p74918
aVTo him thou follow\u2019st I will pay thy graces

p75013
aVIn this last tempest I perceive these lords
p75014
aVAt this encounter do so much admire
p75015
aVThat they devour their reason and scarce think

aVAre natural breath But howsoe\u2019er you have
p75018
aVBeen justled from your senses know for certain

p75108
aVOf roaring shrieking howling jingling chains
p75109
aVAnd more diversity of sounds all horrible
p75110
aVWe were awaked straightway at liberty
p75111
aVWhere we in all her trim freshly beheld

p75142
aVAnd deal in her command without her power
p75143
aVThese three have robbed me and this demi-devil

p75152
aVTo Trinculo How cam\u2019st thou in this pickle
p75153
aVThis is as strange a thing as e\u2019er I looked on

aVSpirits to enforce art to enchant
p75199
aVAnd my ending is despair
p75200
aVUnless I be relieved by prayer
p75201
aVWhich pierces so that it assaults
p75202
aVMercy itself and frees all faults
p75203
aVAs you from crimes would pardoned be
p75204
aVLet your indulgence set me free
p75205

aVFortune forbid my outside have not charmed her
p75432
aVShe made good view of me indeed so much
p75433
aVThat methought her eyes had lost her tongue

aVFor she did speak in starts distractedly
p75435
aVShe loves me sure The cunning of her passion
p75436
aVInvites me in this churlish messenger
p75437
aVNone of my lord\u2019s ring Why he sent her none

aVI am the man If it be so as \u2019tis
p75439
aVPoor lady she were better love a dream

aVIn women\u2019s waxen hearts to set their forms

aVMy state is desperate for my master\u2019s love
p75451
aVAs I am woman now alas the day
p75452
aVWhat thriftless sighs shall poor Olivia breathe

p75466
aVYouth\u2019s a stuff will not endure
p75467
aVGive me some music Music plays Now good morrow friends
p75468
aVNow good Cesario but that piece of song
p75469
aVThat old and antique song we heard last night
p75470
aVMethought it did relieve my passion much
p75471
aVMore than light airs and recollected terms
p75472
aVOf these most brisk and giddy-pacèd times
p75473
aVCome but one verse
p75474
aVSeek him out Curio exits and play the tune the while
p75475
aVTo Viola Come hither boy If ever thou shalt love
p75476
aVIn the sweet pangs of it remember me
p75477
aVFor such as I am all true lovers are
p75478
aVUnstaid and skittish in all motions else
p75479
aVSave in the constant image of the creature
p75480
aVThat is beloved How dost thou like this tune
p75481
aVIt gives a very echo to the seat
p75482
aVWhere love is throned
p75483
aVThou dost speak masterly
p75484
aVMy life upon \u2019t young though thou art thine eye
p75485
aVHath stayed upon some favor that it loves
p75486
aVHath it not boy

aVA little by your favor
p75488
aVWhat kind of woman is \u2019t
p75489
aVOf your complexion
p75490
aVShe is not worth thee then What years i\u2019 faith
p75491
aVAbout your years my lord
p75492
aVToo old by heaven Let still the woman take
p75493
aVAn elder than herself So wears she to him
p75494
aVSo sways she level in her husband\u2019s heart
p75495
aVFor boy however we do praise ourselves
p75496
aVOur fancies are more giddy and unfirm
p75497
aVMore longing wavering sooner lost and worn
p75498
aVThan women\u2019s are
p75499
aVI think it well my lord
p75500
aVThen let thy love be younger than thyself
p75501
aVOr thy affection cannot hold the bent
p75502
aVFor women are as roses whose fair flower
p75503
aVBeing once displayed doth fall that very hour
p75504
aVAnd so they are Alas that they are so
p75505
aVTo die even when they to perfection grow
p75506
aVO fellow come the song we had last night
p75507
aVMark it Cesario It is old and plain
p75508
aVThe spinsters and the knitters in the sun
p75509
aVAnd the free maids that weave their thread with bones
p75510
aVDo use to chant it It is silly sooth
p75511
aVAnd dallies with the innocence of love
p75512
aVLike the old age
p75513
aVCome away come away death
p75514
aVAnd in sad cypress let me be laid
p75515
aVFly away fly away breath
p75516
aVI am slain by a fair cruel maid
p75517
aVMy shroud of white stuck all with yew
p75518
aVO prepare it
p75519
aVMy part of death no one so true
p75520
aVDid share it
p75521
aVNot a flower not a flower sweet
p75522
aVOn my black coffin let there be strown
p75523
aVNot a friend not a friend greet
p75524
aVMy poor corpse where my bones shall be thrown
p75525
aVA thousand thousand sighs to save
p75526
aVLay me O where
p75527
aVSad true lover never find my grave
p75528
aVTo weep there
p75529
aVLet all the rest give place
p75530
aVOnce more Cesario
p75531
aVGet thee to yond same sovereign cruelty
p75532
aVTell her my love more noble than the world
p75533
aVPrizes not quantity of dirty lands
p75534
aVThe parts that Fortune hath bestowed upon her
p75535
aVTell her I hold as giddily as Fortune
p75536
aVBut \u2019tis that miracle and queen of gems
p75537
aVThat nature pranks her in attracts my soul
p75538
aVBut if she cannot love you sir
p75539
aVI cannot be so answered
p75540
aVSooth but you must
p75541
aVSay that some lady as perhaps there is
p75542
aVHath for your love as great a pang of heart
p75543
aVAs you have for Olivia You cannot love her
p75544
aVYou tell her so Must she not then be answered
p75545
aVThere is no woman\u2019s sides
p75546
aVCan bide the beating of so strong a passion
p75547
aVAs love doth give my heart no woman\u2019s heart
p75548
aVSo big to hold so much they lack retention
p75549
aVAlas their love may be called appetite
p75550
aVNo motion of the liver but the palate
p75551
aVThat suffer surfeit cloyment and revolt
p75552
aVBut mine is all as hungry as the sea
p75553
aVAnd can digest as much Make no compare
p75554
aVBetween that love a woman can bear me
p75555
aVAnd that I owe Olivia
p75556
aVAy but I know
p75557
aVWhat dost thou know
p75558
aVToo well what love women to men may owe
p75559
aVIn faith they are as true of heart as we
p75560
aVMy father had a daughter loved a man
p75561
aVAs it might be perhaps were I a woman
p75562
aVI should your Lordship
p75563
aVAnd what\u2019s her history
p75564
aVA blank my lord She never told her love
p75565
aVBut let concealment like a worm i\u2019 th\u2019 bud
p75566
aVFeed on her damask cheek She pined in thought
p75567
aVAnd with a green and yellow melancholy
p75568
aVShe sat like Patience on a monument
p75569
aVSmiling at grief Was not this love indeed
p75570
aVWe men may say more swear more but indeed
p75571
aVOur shows are more than will for still we prove
p75572
aVMuch in our vows but little in our love
p75573
aVBut died thy sister of her love my boy
p75574
aVI am all the daughters of my father\u2019s house
p75575
aVAnd all the brothers too and yet I know not
p75576
aVSir shall I to this lady
p75577
aVAy that\u2019s the theme
p75578
aVTo her in haste Give her this jewel Say
p75579
aVMy love can give no place bide no denay
p75580
aVJove knows I love
p75581
aVBut who
p75582
aVLips do not move
p75583
aVNo man must know
p75584
aVI may command where I adore
p75585
aVBut silence like a Lucrece knife
p75586
aVWith bloodless stroke my heart doth gore
p75587
aVM O A I doth sway my life
p75588
aVThis fellow is wise enough to play the Fool
p75589
aVAnd to do that well craves a kind of wit
p75590
aVHe must observe their mood on whom he jests
p75591
aVThe quality of persons and the time
p75592
aVAnd like the haggard check at every feather
p75593
aVThat comes before his eye This is a practice
p75594
aVAs full of labor as a wise man\u2019s art
p75595
aVFor folly that he wisely shows is fit
p75596
aVBut wise men folly-fall\u2019n quite taint their wit
p75597

p75611
aVBut would you undertake another suit
p75612
aVI had rather hear you to solicit that

aVThan music from the spheres
p75614
aVDear lady
p75615
aVGive me leave beseech you I did send

aVTo force that on you in a shameful cunning
p75621
aVWhich you knew none of yours What might you think
p75622
aVHave you not set mine honor at the stake

p75631
aVWhy then methinks \u2019tis time to smile again
p75632
aVO world how apt the poor are to be proud
p75633
aVIf one should be a prey how much the better
p75634
aVTo fall before the lion than the wolf

aVBut jealousy what might befall your travel

aVYet \u2019tis not madness Where\u2019s Antonio then
p75853
aVI could not find him at the Elephant
p75854
aVYet there he was and there I found this credit
p75855
aVThat he did range the town to seek me out
p75856
aVHis counsel now might do me golden service
p75857
aVFor though my soul disputes well with my sense
p75858
aVThat this may be some error but no madness
p75859
aVYet doth this accident and flood of fortune
p75860
aVSo far exceed all instance all discourse
p75861
aVThat I am ready to distrust mine eyes
p75862
aVAnd wrangle with my reason that persuades me
p75863
aVTo any other trust but that I am mad
p75864
aVOr else the lady\u2019s mad Yet if \u2019twere so
p75865
aVShe could not sway her house command her followers
p75866
aVTake and give back affairs and their dispatch
p75867
aVWith such a smooth discreet and stable bearing
p75868
aVAs I perceive she does There\u2019s something in \u2019t
p75869
aVThat is deceivable But here the lady comes
p75870
aVBlame not this haste of mine If you mean well
p75871
aVNow go with me and with this holy man
p75872
aVInto the chantry by There before him
p75873
aVAnd underneath that consecrated roof
p75874
aVPlight me the full assurance of your faith
p75875
aVThat my most jealous and too doubtful soul
p75876
aVMay live at peace He shall conceal it

aVHere comes the man sir that did rescue me
p75889
aVThat face of his I do remember well
p75890
aVYet when I saw it last it was besmeared
p75891
aVAs black as Vulcan in the smoke of war
p75892
aVA baubling vessel was he captain of
p75893
aVFor shallow draught and bulk unprizable
p75894
aVWith which such scatheful grapple did he make
p75895
aVWith the most noble bottom of our fleet
p75896
aVThat very envy and the tongue of loss
p75897
aVCried fame and honor on him What\u2019s the matter
p75898
aVOrsino this is that Antonio
p75899
aVThat took the Phoenix and her fraught from Candy
p75900
aVAnd this is he that did the Tiger board
p75901
aVWhen your young nephew Titus lost his leg
p75902
aVHere in the streets desperate of shame and state
p75903
aVIn private brabble did we apprehend him
p75904
aVHe did me kindness sir drew on my side
p75905
aVBut in conclusion put strange speech upon me
p75906
aVI know not what \u2019twas but distraction
p75907
aVNotable pirate thou saltwater thief
p75908
aVWhat foolish boldness brought thee to their mercies

p75913
aVAntonio never yet was thief or pirate
p75914
aVThough I confess on base and ground enough
p75915
aVOrsino\u2019s enemy A witchcraft drew me hither
p75916
aVThat most ingrateful boy there by your side
p75917
aVFrom the rude sea\u2019s enraged and foamy mouth
p75918
aVDid I redeem a wrack past hope he was
p75919
aVHis life I gave him and did thereto add
p75920
aVMy love without retention or restraint
p75921
aVAll his in dedication For his sake
p75922
aVDid I expose myself pure for his love
p75923
aVInto the danger of this adverse town
p75924
aVDrew to defend him when he was beset
p75925
aVWhere being apprehended his false cunning
p75926
aVNot meaning to partake with me in danger
p75927
aVTaught him to face me out of his acquaintance
p75928
aVAnd grew a twenty years\u2019 removèd thing

aVWhile one would wink denied me mine own purse
p75930

aVBut had it been the brother of my blood
p76025
aVI must have done no less with wit and safety
p76026
aVYou throw a strange regard upon me and by that
p76027
aVI do perceive it hath offended you
p76028
aVPardon me sweet one even for the vows
p76029
aVWe made each other but so late ago
p76030
aVOne face one voice one habit and two persons
p76031
aVA natural perspective that is and is not
p76032
aVAntonio O my dear Antonio
p76033
aVHow have the hours racked and tortured me
p76034
aVSince I have lost thee
p76035
aVSebastian are you
p76036
aVFear\u2019st thou that Antonio
p76037
aVHow have you made division of yourself
p76038
aVAn apple cleft in two is not more twin
p76039
aVThan these two creatures Which is Sebastian
p76040
aVMost wonderful
p76041
aVDo I stand there I never had a brother
p76042
aVNor can there be that deity in my nature
p76043
aVOf here and everywhere I had a sister
p76044
aVWhom the blind waves and surges have devoured
p76045
aVOf charity what kin are you to me
p76046
aVWhat countryman What name What parentage
p76047
aVOf Messaline Sebastian was my father
p76048
aVSuch a Sebastian was my brother too
p76049
aVSo went he suited to his watery tomb
p76050
aVIf spirits can assume both form and suit
p76051
aVYou come to fright us
p76052
aVA spirit I am indeed
p76053
aVBut am in that dimension grossly clad
p76054
aVWhich from the womb I did participate
p76055
aVWere you a woman as the rest goes even
p76056
aVI should my tears let fall upon your cheek
p76057
aVAnd say Thrice welcome drownèd Viola
p76058
aVMy father had a mole upon his brow
p76059
aVAnd so had mine
p76060
aVAnd died that day when Viola from her birth
p76061
aVHad numbered thirteen years
p76062
aVO that record is lively in my soul
p76063
aVHe finishèd indeed his mortal act
p76064
aVThat day that made my sister thirteen years
p76065
aVIf nothing lets to make us happy both
p76066
aVBut this my masculine usurped attire
p76067
aVDo not embrace me till each circumstance
p76068
aVOf place time fortune do cohere and jump
p76069
aVThat I am Viola which to confirm
p76070
aVI\u2019ll bring you to a captain in this town
p76071
aVWhere lie my maiden weeds by whose gentle help
p76072
aVI was preserved to serve this noble count
p76073
aVAll the occurrence of my fortune since
p76074
aVHath been between this lady and this lord
p76075
aVSo comes it lady you have been mistook
p76076
aVBut nature to her bias drew in that
p76077
aVYou would have been contracted to a maid
p76078
aVNor are you therein by my life deceived
p76079
aVYou are betrothed both to a maid and man
p76080
aVBe not amazed right noble is his blood
p76081
aVIf this be so as yet the glass seems true
p76082
aVI shall have share in this most happy wrack
p76083
aVBoy thou hast said to me a thousand times
p76084
aVThou never shouldst love woman like to me
p76085
aVAnd all those sayings will I overswear
p76086
aVAnd all those swearings keep as true in soul
p76087
aVAs doth that orbèd continent the fire
p76088
aVThat severs day from night
p76089
aVGive me thy hand
p76090
aVAnd let me see thee in thy woman\u2019s weeds
p76091
aVThe Captain that did bring me first on shore
p76092
aVHath my maid\u2019s garments He upon some action
p76093
aVIs now in durance at Malvolio\u2019s suit
p76094
aVA gentleman and follower of my lady\u2019s
p76095
aVHe shall enlarge him
p76096
aVFetch Malvolio hither
p76097
aVAnd yet alas now I remember me
p76098
aVThey say poor gentleman he\u2019s much distract
p76099
aVA most extracting frenzy of mine own
p76100
aVFrom my remembrance clearly banished his
p76101
aVTo the Fool How does he sirrah
p76102
aVThis savors not much of distraction
p76103
aVSee him delivered Fabian Bring him hither
p76104
aVTo Orsino My lord so please you these things further thought on
p76105
aVTo think me as well a sister as a wife

aVOne day shall crown th\u2019 alliance on \u2019t so please you
p76107
aVHere at my house and at my proper cost
p76108
aVMadam I am most apt t\u2019 embrace your offer
p76109
aVTo Viola Your master quits you and for your service done him
p76110
aVSo much against the mettle of your sex
p76111
aVSo far beneath your soft and tender breeding
p76112
aVAnd since you called me master for so long
p76113
aVHere is my hand You shall from this time be
p76114
aVYour master\u2019s mistress
p76115
aVA sister You are she
p76116
aVIs this the madman
p76117
aVAy my lord this same
p76118
aVHow now Malvolio
p76119
aVMadam you have done me wrong
p76120
aVNotorious wrong
p76121
aVHave I Malvolio No
p76122
aVLady you have Pray you peruse that letter
p76123
aVYou must not now deny it is your hand
p76124
aVWrite from it if you can in hand or phrase
p76125
aVOr say \u2019tis not your seal not your invention
p76126
aVYou can say none of this Well grant it then
p76127
aVAnd tell me in the modesty of honor
p76128
aVWhy you have given me such clear lights of favor
p76129
aVBade me come smiling and cross-gartered to you
p76130
aVTo put on yellow stockings and to frown
p76131
aVUpon Sir Toby and the lighter people
p76132
aVAnd acting this in an obedient hope
p76133
aVWhy have you suffered me to be imprisoned
p76134
aVKept in a dark house visited by the priest
p76135
aVAnd made the most notorious geck and gull
p76136
aVThat e\u2019er invention played on Tell me why
p76137
aVAlas Malvolio this is not my writing
p76138
aVThough I confess much like the character
p76139
aVBut out of question \u2019tis Maria\u2019s hand
p76140
aVAnd now I do bethink me it was she
p76141
aVFirst told me thou wast mad then cam\u2019st in smiling
p76142
aVAnd in such forms which here were presupposed
p76143
aVUpon thee in the letter Prithee be content
p76144
aVThis practice hath most shrewdly passed upon thee
p76145
aVBut when we know the grounds and authors of it
p76146
aVThou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judge
p76147
aVOf thine own cause
p76148
aVGood madam hear me speak
p76149
aVAnd let no quarrel nor no brawl to come
p76150
aVTaint the condition of this present hour
p76151
aVWhich I have wondered at In hope it shall not
p76152
aVMost freely I confess myself and Toby
p76153
aVSet this device against Malvolio here
p76154
aVUpon some stubborn and uncourteous parts
p76155
aVWe had conceived against him Maria writ
p76156
aVThe letter at Sir Toby\u2019s great importance
p76157
aVIn recompense whereof he hath married her
p76158
aVHow with a sportful malice it was followed
p76159
aVMay rather pluck on laughter than revenge
p76160
aVIf that the injuries be justly weighed
p76161
aVThat have on both sides passed
p76162
aVAlas poor fool how have they baffled thee
p76163
aVI\u2019ll be revenged on the whole pack of you
p76164
aVHe hath been most notoriously abused
p76165
aVPursue him and entreat him to a peace
p76166
aVHe hath not told us of the Captain yet
p76167
aVWhen that is known and golden time convents
p76168
aVA solemn combination shall be made
p76169
aVOf our dear souls Meantime sweet sister
p76170
aVWe will not part from hence Cesario come
p76171
aVFor so you shall be while you are a man
p76172
aVBut when in other habits you are seen
p76173
aVOrsino\u2019s mistress and his fancy\u2019s queen
p76174
aVWhen that I was and a little tiny boy
p76175
aVWith hey ho the wind and the rain
p76176
aVA foolish thing was but a toy
p76177
aVFor the rain it raineth every day
p76178
aVBut when I came to man\u2019s estate
p76179
aVWith hey ho the wind and the rain
p76180
aV\u2019Gainst knaves and thieves men shut their gate
p76181
aVFor the rain it raineth every day
p76182
aVBut when I came alas to wive
p76183
aVWith hey ho the wind and the rain
p76184
aVBy swaggering could I never thrive
p76185
aVFor the rain it raineth every day
p76186
aVBut when I came unto my beds
p76187
aVWith hey ho the wind and the rain
p76188
aVWith tosspots still had drunken heads
p76189
aVFor the rain it raineth every day
p76190
aVA great while ago the world begun
p76191
aVWith hey ho the wind and the rain
p76192
aVBut that\u2019s all one our play is done
p76193
aVAnd we\u2019ll strive to please you every day
p76194
aVIn Troy there lies the scene From isles of Greece
p76195
aVThe princes orgulous their high blood chafed
p76196
aVHave to the port of Athens sent their ships
p76197
aVFraught with the ministers and instruments
p76198
aVOf cruel war Sixty and nine that wore
p76199
aVTheir crownets regal from th\u2019 Athenian bay
p76200
aVPut forth toward Phrygia and their vow is made
p76201
aVTo ransack Troy within whose strong immures
p76202
aVThe ravished Helen Menelaus\u2019 queen
p76203
aVWith wanton Paris sleeps and that\u2019s the quarrel
p76204
aVTo Tenedos they come
p76205
aVAnd the deep-drawing barks do there disgorge
p76206
aVTheir warlike fraughtage Now on Dardan plains
p76207
aVThe fresh and yet unbruisèd Greeks do pitch
p76208
aVTheir brave pavilions Priam\u2019s six-gated city
p76209
aVDardan and Timbria Helias Chetas Troien
p76210
aVAnd Antenorides with massy staples
p76211
aVAnd corresponsive and fulfilling bolts
p76212
aVSpar up the sons of Troy
p76213
aVNow expectation tickling skittish spirits
p76214
aVOn one and other side Trojan and Greek
p76215
aVSets all on hazard And hither am I come
p76216
aVA prologue armed but not in confidence
p76217
aVOf author\u2019s pen or actor\u2019s voice but suited
p76218
aVIn like conditions as our argument
p76219
aVTo tell you fair beholders that our play
p76220
aVLeaps o\u2019er the vaunt and firstlings of those broils
p76221
aVBeginning in the middle starting thence away
p76222
aVTo what may be digested in a play
p76223
aVLike or find fault do as your pleasures are
p76224
aVNow good or bad \u2019tis but the chance of war
p76225
aVCall here my varlet I\u2019ll unarm again
p76226
aVWhy should I war without the walls of Troy
p76227
aVThat find such cruel battle here within
p76228
aVEach Trojan that is master of his heart
p76229
aVLet him to field Troilus alas hath none
p76230
aVThe Greeks are strong and skilful to their strength
p76231
aVFierce to their skill and to their fierceness valiant
p76232
aVBut I am weaker than a woman\u2019s tear
p76233
aVTamer than sleep fonder than ignorance
p76234
aVLess valiant than the virgin in the night
p76235
aVAnd skilless as unpracticed infancy
p76236
aVPatience herself what goddess e\u2019er she be
p76237
aVDoth lesser blench at suff\u2019rance than I do
p76238
aVAt Priam\u2019s royal table do I sit
p76239
aVAnd when fair Cressid comes into my thoughts
p76240
aVSo traitor When she comes When is she thence
p76241
aVI was about to tell thee when my heart
p76242
aVAs wedgèd with a sigh would rive in twain
p76243
aVLest Hector or my father should perceive me
p76244
aVI have as when the sun doth light a-scorn
p76245
aVBuried this sigh in wrinkle of a smile
p76246
aVBut sorrow that is couched in seeming gladness
p76247
aVIs like that mirth fate turns to sudden sadness
p76248
aVO Pandarus I tell thee Pandarus
p76249
aVWhen I do tell thee there my hopes lie drowned
p76250
aVReply not in how many fathoms deep
p76251
aVThey lie indrenched I tell thee I am mad
p76252
aVIn Cressid\u2019s love Thou answer\u2019st she is fair
p76253
aVPourest in the open ulcer of my heart
p76254
aVHer eyes her hair her cheek her gait her voice
p76255
aVHandiest in thy discourse O that her hand
p76256
aVIn whose comparison all whites are ink
p76257
aVWriting their own reproach to whose soft seizure
p76258
aVThe cygnet\u2019s down is harsh and spirit of sense
p76259
aVHard as the palm of plowman This thou tell\u2019st me
p76260
aVAs true thou tell\u2019st me when I say I love her
p76261
aVBut saying thus instead of oil and balm
p76262
aVThou lay\u2019st in every gash that love hath given me
p76263
aVThe knife that made it
p76264
aVPeace you ungracious clamors Peace rude sounds
p76265
aVFools on both sides Helen must needs be fair
p76266
aVWhen with your blood you daily paint her thus
p76267
aVI cannot fight upon this argument
p76268
aVIt is too starved a subject for my sword
p76269
aVBut Pandarus O gods how do you plague me
p76270
aVI cannot come to Cressid but by Pandar
p76271
aVAnd he\u2019s as tetchy to be wooed to woo
p76272
aVAs she is stubborn-chaste against all suit
p76273
aVTell me Apollo for thy Daphnes love
p76274
aVWhat Cressid is what Pandar and what we
p76275
aVHer bed is India there she lies a pearl
p76276
aVBetween our Ilium and where she resides
p76277
aVLet it be called the wild and wand\u2019ring flood
p76278
aVOurself the merchant and this sailing Pandar
p76279
aVOur doubtful hope our convoy and our bark
p76280
aVHow now Prince Troilus Wherefore not afield
p76281
aVBecause not there This woman\u2019s answer sorts
p76282
aVFor womanish it is to be from thence
p76283
aVWhat news Aeneas from the field today
p76284
aVThat Paris is returnèd home and hurt
p76285
aVBy whom Aeneas
p76286
aVTroilus by Menelaus
p76287
aVLet Paris bleed \u2019Tis but a scar to scorn
p76288
aVParis is gored with Menelaus\u2019 horn
p76289
aVHark what good sport is out of town today
p76290
aVBetter at home if would I might were may
p76291
aVBut to the sport abroad Are you bound thither
p76292
aVIn all swift haste
p76293
aVCome go we then together
p76294
aVWho were those went by
p76295
aVQueen Hecuba and Helen
p76296
aVAnd whither go they
p76297
aVUp to the eastern tower
p76298
aVWhose height commands as subject all the vale
p76299
aVTo see the battle Hector whose patience
p76300
aVIs as a virtue fixed today was moved
p76301
aVHe chid Andromache and struck his armorer
p76302
aVAnd like as there were husbandry in war
p76303
aVBefore the sun rose he was harnessed light
p76304
aVAnd to the field goes he where every flower
p76305
aVDid as a prophet weep what it foresaw
p76306
aVIn Hector\u2019s wrath
p76307
aVWhat was his cause of anger
p76308
aVThe noise goes this there is among the Greeks
p76309
aVA lord of Trojan blood nephew to Hector
p76310
aVThey call him Ajax
p76311
aVGood and what of him
p76312
aVThey say he is a very man per se
p76313
aVAnd stands alone
p76314
aVBy the same token you are a bawd
p76315
aVWords vows gifts tears and love\u2019s full sacrifice
p76316
aVHe offers in another\u2019s enterprise
p76317
aVBut more in Troilus thousandfold I see
p76318
aVThan in the glass of Pandar\u2019s praise may be
p76319
aVYet hold I off Women are angels wooing
p76320
aVThings won are done joy\u2019s soul lies in the doing
p76321
aVThat she beloved knows naught that knows not this
p76322
aVMen prize the thing ungained more than it is
p76323
aVThat she was never yet that ever knew
p76324
aVLove got so sweet as when desire did sue
p76325
aVTherefore this maxim out of love I teach
p76326
aVAchievement is command ungained beseech
p76327
aVThen though my heart\u2019s content firm love doth bear
p76328
aVNothing of that shall from mine eyes appear
p76329
aVPrinces what grief hath set the jaundice o\u2019er your cheeks
p76330
aVThe ample proposition that hope makes
p76331
aVIn all designs begun on Earth below
p76332
aVFails in the promised largeness Checks and disasters
p76333

p76334
aVAs knots by the conflux of meeting sap
p76335
aVInfects the sound pine and diverts his grain
p76336
aVTortive and errant from his course of growth
p76337
aVNor princes is it matter new to us
p76338
aVThat we come short of our suppose so far
p76339
aVThat after seven years\u2019 siege yet Troy walls stand
p76340
aVSith every action that hath gone before
p76341
aVWhereof we have record trial did draw
p76342
aVBias and thwart not answering the aim
p76343
aVAnd that unbodied figure of the thought
p76344
aVThat gave \u2019t surmisèd shape Why then you princes
p76345
aVDo you with cheeks abashed behold our works
p76346
aVAnd call them shames which are indeed naught else
p76347
aVBut the protractive trials of great Jove
p76348
aVTo find persistive constancy in men
p76349
aVThe fineness of which metal is not found
p76350
aVIn Fortune\u2019s love for then the bold and coward
p76351
aVThe wise and fool the artist and unread
p76352
aVThe hard and soft seem all affined and kin

p76354
aVDistinction with a broad and powerful fan
p76355
aVPuffing at all winnows the light away

aVLies rich in virtue and unmingled
p76358
aVWith due observance of thy godlike seat
p76359
aVGreat Agamemnon Nestor shall apply
p76360
aVThy latest words In the reproof of chance

aVLies the true proof of men The sea being smooth
p76362
aVHow many shallow bauble boats dare sail
p76363
aVUpon her patient breast making their way
p76364
aVWith those of nobler bulk
p76365
aVBut let the ruffian Boreas once enrage
p76366
aVThe gentle Thetis and anon behold
p76367
aVThe strong-ribbed bark through liquid mountains cut
p76368
aVBounding between the two moist elements

aVLike Perseus\u2019 horse Where\u2019s then the saucy boat

aVIn storms of Fortune For in her ray and brightness
p76375
aVThe herd hath more annoyance by the breese
p76376
aVThan by the tiger but when the splitting wind
p76377
aVMakes flexible the knees of knotted oaks
p76378

p76388
aVThe which to Agamemnon most mighty for thy place and sway

aVTo Nestor And thou most reverend for thy stretched-out life
p76390
aVI give to both your speeches which were such
p76391
aVAs Agamemnon and the hand of Greece
p76392
aVShould hold up high in brass and such again
p76393
aVAs venerable Nestor hatched in silver
p76394
aVShould with a bond of air strong as the axletree

aVBut for these instances

p76420
aVCorrects the influence of evil planets

aVSuch to-be-pitied and o\u2019erwrested seeming
p76486
aVHe acts thy greatness in and when he speaks
p76487
aV\u2019Tis like a chime a-mending with terms unsquared
p76488
aVWhich from the tongue of roaring Typhon dropped
p76489
aVWould seem hyperboles At this fusty stuff
p76490
aVThe large Achilles on his pressed bed lolling
p76491
aVFrom his deep chest laughs out a loud applause
p76492
aVCries Excellent \u2019Tis Agamemnon right
p76493
aVNow play me Nestor hem and stroke thy beard

aVThat\u2019s done as near as the extremest ends

p76517
aVIn such a rein in full as proud a place
p76518
aVAs broad Achilles keeps his tent like him
p76519
aVMakes factious feasts rails on our state of war
p76520
aVBold as an oracle and sets Thersites
p76521
aVA slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint
p76522
aVTo match us in comparisons with dirt
p76523
aVTo weaken and discredit our exposure

p76531
aVOf their observant toil the enemy\u2019s weight
p76532
aVWhy this hath not a fingers dignity
p76533
aVThey call this bed-work mapp\u2019ry closet war
p76534
aVSo that the ram that batters down the wall
p76535
aVFor the great swinge and rudeness of his poise
p76536

aVOr those that with the fineness of their souls

aV\u2019Fore all the Greekish host which with one voice

p76552
aVA stranger to those most imperial looks
p76553
aVKnow them from eyes of other mortals
p76554
aVHow
p76555
aVAy I ask that I might waken reverence
p76556
aVAnd bid the cheek be ready with a blush
p76557
aVModest as morning when she coldly eyes
p76558
aVThe youthful Phoebus
p76559
aVWhich is that god in office guiding men
p76560
aVWhich is the high and mighty Agamemnon
p76561
aVThis Trojan scorns us or the men of Troy
p76562
aVAre ceremonious courtiers
p76563
aVCourtiers as free as debonair unarmed
p76564
aVAs bending angels that\u2019s their fame in peace
p76565
aVBut when they would seem soldiers they have galls
p76566
aVGood arms strong joints true swords and great Jove\u2019s accord
p76567
aVNothing so full of heart But peace Aeneas
p76568
aVPeace Trojan Lay thy finger on thy lips
p76569
aVThe worthiness of praise distains his worth
p76570
aVIf that the praised himself bring the praise forth
p76571
aVBut what the repining enemy commends
p76572
aVThat breath fame blows that praise sole pure transcends
p76573
aVSir you of Troy call you yourself Aeneas
p76574
aVAy Greek that is my name
p76575
aVWhat\u2019s your affair I pray you
p76576
aVSir pardon \u2019Tis for Agamemnon\u2019s ears
p76577
aVHe hears naught privately that comes from Troy
p76578
aVNor I from Troy come not to whisper with him
p76579
aVI bring a trumpet to awake his ear
p76580
aVTo set his sense on the attentive bent
p76581
aVAnd then to speak
p76582
aVSpeak frankly as the wind
p76583
aVIt is not Agamemnon\u2019s sleeping hour
p76584
aVThat thou shalt know Trojan he is awake
p76585
aVHe tells thee so himself
p76586
aVTrumpet blow loud
p76587
aVSend thy brass voice through all these lazy tents
p76588
aVAnd every Greek of mettle let him know
p76589
aVWhat Troy means fairly shall be spoke aloud
p76590
aVWe have great Agamemnon here in Troy
p76591
aVA prince called Hector Priam is his father
p76592
aVWho in this dull and long-continued truce
p76593
aVIs resty grown He bade me take a trumpet
p76594
aVAnd to this purpose speak Kings princes lords
p76595
aVIf there be one among the fair\u2019st of Greece
p76596
aVThat holds his honor higher than his ease
p76597
aVThat seeks his praise more than he fears his peril
p76598
aVThat knows his valor and knows not his fear
p76599
aVThat loves his mistress more than in confession
p76600
aVWith truant vows to her own lips he loves
p76601
aVAnd dare avow her beauty and her worth
p76602
aVIn other arms than hers to him this challenge
p76603
aVHector in view of Trojans and of Greeks
p76604
aVShall make it good or do his best to do it
p76605
aVHe hath a lady wiser fairer truer
p76606
aVThan ever Greek did couple in his arms
p76607
aVAnd will tomorrow with his trumpet call
p76608
aVMidway between your tents and walls of Troy
p76609
aVTo rouse a Grecian that is true in love
p76610
aVIf any come Hector shall honor him
p76611
aVIf none he\u2019ll say in Troy when he retires
p76612
aVThe Grecian dames are sunburnt and not worth
p76613
aVThe splinter of a lance Even so much
p76614
aVThis shall be told our lovers Lord Aeneas
p76615
aVIf none of them have soul in such a kind
p76616
aVWe left them all at home But we are soldiers
p76617
aVAnd may that soldier a mere recreant prove
p76618
aVThat means not hath not or is not in love
p76619
aVIf then one is or hath or means to be
p76620
aVThat one meets Hector If none else I am he
p76621
aVTell him of Nestor one that was a man
p76622
aVWhen Hector\u2019s grandsire sucked He is old now
p76623
aVBut if there be not in our Grecian host
p76624
aVA noble man that hath one spark of fire
p76625
aVTo answer for his love tell him from me
p76626
aVI\u2019ll hide my silver beard in a gold beaver
p76627
aVAnd in my vambrace put my withered brawns
p76628
aVAnd meeting him will tell him that my lady
p76629
aVWas fairer than his grandam and as chaste
p76630
aVAs may be in the world His youth in flood
p76631
aVI\u2019ll prove this troth with my three drops of blood
p76632
aVNow heavens forfend such scarcity of youth
p76633
aVAmen
p76634
aVFair Lord Aeneas let me touch your hand
p76635
aVTo our pavilion shall I lead you sir
p76636
aVAchilles shall have word of this intent
p76637
aVSo shall each lord of Greece from tent to tent
p76638
aVYourself shall feast with us before you go
p76639
aVAnd find the welcome of a noble foe
p76640
aVNestor
p76641
aVWhat says Ulysses
p76642
aVI have a young conception in my brain
p76643
aVBe you my time to bring it to some shape
p76644
aVWhat is \u2019t
p76645
aVThis \u2019tis
p76646
aVBlunt wedges rive hard knots the seeded pride
p76647
aVThat hath to this maturity blown up
p76648
aVIn rank Achilles must or now be cropped
p76649
aVOr shedding breed a nursery of like evil
p76650
aVTo overbulk us all
p76651
aVWell and how
p76652
aVThis challenge that the gallant Hector sends
p76653
aVHowever it is spread in general name
p76654
aVRelates in purpose only to Achilles
p76655
aVTrue The purpose is perspicuous as substance
p76656
aVWhose grossness little characters sum up
p76657
aVAnd in the publication make no strain
p76658
aVBut that Achilles were his brain as barren
p76659
aVAs banks of Libya though Apollo knows
p76660
aV\u2019Tis dry enough will with great speed of judgment
p76661
aVAy with celerity find Hector\u2019s purpose
p76662
aVPointing on him
p76663
aVAnd wake him to the answer think you
p76664
aVWhy \u2019tis most meet Who may you else oppose
p76665
aVThat can from Hector bring his honor off
p76666
aVIf not Achilles Though \u2019t be a sportful combat
p76667
aVYet in the trial much opinion dwells
p76668
aVFor here the Trojans taste our dear\u2019st repute
p76669
aVWith their fin\u2019st palate And trust to me Ulysses
p76670
aVOur imputation shall be oddly poised
p76671
aVIn this vile action For the success
p76672
aVAlthough particular shall give a scantling
p76673
aVOf good or bad unto the general
p76674
aVAnd in such indexes although small pricks
p76675
aVTo their subsequent volumes there is seen
p76676
aVThe baby figure of the giant mass
p76677
aVOf things to come at large It is supposed
p76678
aVHe that meets Hector issues from our choice
p76679
aVAnd choice being mutual act of all our souls
p76680
aVMakes merit her election and doth boil
p76681
aVAs \u2019twere from forth us all a man distilled
p76682
aVOut of our virtues who miscarrying
p76683
aVWhat heart receives from hence a conquering part
p76684
aVTo steel a strong opinion to themselves
p76685
aVWhich entertained limbs are his instruments
p76686
aVIn no less working than are swords and bows
p76687
aVDirective by the limbs
p76688
aVGive pardon to my speech therefore \u2019tis meet
p76689
aVAchilles meet not Hector Let us like merchants
p76690
aVFirst show foul wares and think perchance they\u2019ll sell
p76691
aVIf not the luster of the better shall exceed
p76692
aVBy showing the worse first Do not consent
p76693
aVThat ever Hector and Achilles meet
p76694
aVFor both our honor and our shame in this
p76695
aVAre dogged with two strange followers
p76696
aVI see them not with my old eyes What are they
p76697
aVWhat glory our Achilles shares from Hector
p76698
aVWere he not proud we all should share with him
p76699
aVBut he already is too insolent
p76700
aVAnd it were better parch in Afric sun
p76701
aVThan in the pride and salt scorn of his eyes
p76702
aVShould he scape Hector fair If he were foiled
p76703
aVWhy then we do our main opinion crush
p76704
aVIn taint of our best man No make a lott\u2019ry
p76705
aVAnd by device let blockish Ajax draw
p76706
aVThe sort to fight with Hector Among ourselves
p76707
aVGive him allowance for the better man
p76708
aVFor that will physic the great Myrmidon
p76709
aVWho broils in loud applause and make him fall
p76710
aVHis crest that prouder than blue Iris bends
p76711
aVIf the dull brainless Ajax come safe off
p76712
aVWe\u2019ll dress him up in voices if he fail
p76713
aVYet go we under our opinion still
p76714
aVThat we have better men But hit or miss
p76715
aVOur project\u2019s life this shape of sense assumes
p76716
aVAjax employed plucks down Achilles\u2019 plumes
p76717
aVNow Ulysses I begin to relish thy advice
p76718
aVAnd I will give a taste thereof forthwith
p76719
aVTo Agamemnon Go we to him straight
p76720
aVTwo curs shall tame each other pride alone
p76721
aVMust tar the mastiffs on as \u2019twere a bone
p76722
aVA good riddance
p76723
aVMarry this sir is proclaimed through all our host
p76724
aVThat Hector by the fifth hour of the sun
p76725
aVWill with a trumpet \u2019twixt our tents and Troy
p76726
aVTomorrow morning call some knight to arms
p76727
aVThat hath a stomach and such a one that dare
p76728
aVMaintain I know not what \u2019tis trash Farewell
p76729
aVFarewell Who shall answer him
p76730
aVI know not \u2019Tis put to lott\u2019ry Otherwise
p76731
aVHe knew his man
p76732
aVAfter so many hours lives speeches spent
p76733
aVThus once again says Nestor from the Greeks
p76734
aVDeliver Helen and all damage else
p76735
aVAs honor loss of time travel expense
p76736
aVWounds friends and what else dear that is consumed
p76737
aVIn hot digestion of this cormorant war
p76738
aVShall be struck off Hector what say you to \u2019t
p76739
aVThough no man lesser fears the Greeks than I
p76740
aVAs far as toucheth my particular
p76741
aVYet dread Priam
p76742
aVThere is no lady of more softer bowels
p76743
aVMore spongy to suck in the sense of fear
p76744
aVMore ready to cry out Who knows what follows
p76745
aVThan Hector is The wound of peace is surety
p76746
aVSurety secure but modest doubt is called
p76747
aVThe beacon of the wise the tent that searches
p76748
aVTo th\u2019 bottom of the worst Let Helen go
p76749
aVSince the first sword was drawn about this question
p76750
aVEvery tithe soul \u2019mongst many thousand dismes
p76751
aVHath been as dear as Helen I mean of ours
p76752
aVIf we have lost so many tenths of ours
p76753
aVTo guard a thing not ours nor worth to us
p76754
aVHad it our name the value of one ten
p76755
aVWhat merit\u2019s in that reason which denies
p76756
aVThe yielding of her up
p76757
aVFie fie my brother
p76758
aVWeigh you the worth and honor of a king
p76759
aVSo great as our dread father\u2019s in a scale
p76760
aVOf common ounces Will you with counters sum
p76761
aVThe past-proportion of his infinite
p76762
aVAnd buckle in a waist most fathomless
p76763
aVWith spans and inches so diminutive
p76764
aVAs fears and reasons Fie for godly shame
p76765
aVNo marvel though you bite so sharp at reasons
p76766
aVYou are so empty of them Should not our father
p76767
aVBear the great sway of his affairs with reason
p76768
aVBecause your speech hath none that tell him so
p76769
aVYou are for dreams and slumbers brother priest
p76770
aVYou fur your gloves with reason Here are your reasons
p76771
aVYou know an enemy intends you harm
p76772
aVYou know a sword employed is perilous
p76773
aVAnd reason flies the object of all harm
p76774
aVWho marvels then when Helenus beholds
p76775
aVA Grecian and his sword if he do set
p76776
aVThe very wings of reason to his heels
p76777
aVAnd fly like chidden Mercury from Jove
p76778
aVOr like a star disorbed Nay if we talk of reason
p76779
aVLet\u2019s shut our gates and sleep Manhood and honor
p76780

aVWith this crammed reason Reason and respect

aVIt holds his estimate and dignity
p76788
aVAs well wherein \u2019tis precious of itself
p76789
aVAs in the prizer \u2019Tis mad idolatry
p76790
aVTo make the service greater than the god

aVWhen we have soiled them nor the remainder viands
p76804
aVWe do not throw in unrespective sieve
p76805
aVBecause we now are full It was thought meet

aVParis should do some vengeance on the Greeks
p76807
aVYour breath with full consent bellied his sails
p76808
aVThe seas and winds old wranglers took a truce
p76809
aVAnd did him service He touched the ports desired

aVAnd cried Inestimable why do you now

aVThe issue of your proper wisdoms rate

aVAnd do a deed that never Fortune did
p76824
aVBeggar the estimation which you prized
p76825
aVRicher than sea and land O theft most base

aVThat we have stol\u2019n what we do fear to keep

aVSome touches of remorse Or is your blood
p76850
aVSo madly hot that no discourse of reason

p76852
aVCan qualify the same
p76853
aVWhy brother Hector

aVWe may not think the justness of each act
p76855
aVSuch and no other than event doth form it
p76856
aVNor once deject the courage of our minds
p76857
aVBecause Cassandra\u2019s mad Her brainsick raptures
p76858
aVCannot distaste the goodness of a quarrel
p76859
aVWhich hath our several honors all engaged
p76860
aVTo make it gracious For my private part
p76861
aVI am no more touched than all Priam\u2019s sons
p76862
aVAnd Jove forbid there should be done amongst us
p76863
aVSuch things as might offend the weakest spleen
p76864
aVTo fight for and maintain

aVFor what alas can these my single arms
p76871
aVWhat propugnation is in one man\u2019s valor
p76872
aVTo stand the push and enmity of those
p76873
aVThis quarrel would excite Yet I protest
p76874
aVWere I alone to pass the difficulties
p76875
aVAnd had as ample power as I have will
p76876
aVParis should ne\u2019er retract what he hath done
p76877
aVNor faint in the pursuit
p76878
aVParis you speak
p76879
aVLike one besotted on your sweet delights
p76880
aVYou have the honey still but these the gall
p76881
aVSo to be valiant is no praise at all
p76882
aVSir I propose not merely to myself
p76883
aVThe pleasures such a beauty brings with it
p76884
aVBut I would have the soil of her fair rape
p76885
aVWiped off in honorable keeping her
p76886
aVWhat treason were it to the ransacked queen
p76887
aVDisgrace to your great worths and shame to me
p76888
aVNow to deliver her possession up
p76889
aVOn terms of base compulsion Can it be
p76890
aVThat so degenerate a strain as this
p76891
aVShould once set footing in your generous bosoms
p76892
aVThere\u2019s not the meanest spirit on our party
p76893
aVWithout a heart to dare or sword to draw
p76894
aVWhen Helen is defended nor none so noble
p76895
aVWhose life were ill bestowed or death unfamed
p76896
aVWhere Helen is the subject Then I say
p76897
aVWell may we fight for her whom we know well
p76898
aVThe world\u2019s large spaces cannot parallel
p76899
aVParis and Troilus you have both said well
p76900
aVAnd on the cause and question now in hand
p76901
aVHave glozed but superficially not much
p76902
aVUnlike young men whom Aristotle thought
p76903
aVUnfit to hear moral philosophy
p76904
aVThe reasons you allege do more conduce
p76905
aVTo the hot passion of distempered blood
p76906
aVThan to make up a free determination
p76907
aV\u2019Twixt right and wrong for pleasure and revenge
p76908
aVHave ears more deaf than adders to the voice
p76909
aVOf any true decision Nature craves
p76910
aVAll dues be rendered to their owners Now
p76911
aVWhat nearer debt in all humanity
p76912
aVThan wife is to the husband If this law
p76913
aVOf nature be corrupted through affection
p76914
aVAnd that great minds of partial indulgence
p76915
aVTo their benumbèd wills resist the same
p76916
aVThere is a law in each well-ordered nation
p76917
aVTo curb those raging appetites that are
p76918
aVMost disobedient and refractory
p76919
aVIf Helen then be wife to Sparta\u2019s king
p76920
aVAs it is known she is these moral laws
p76921
aVOf nature and of nations speak aloud
p76922
aVTo have her back returned Thus to persist
p76923
aVIn doing wrong extenuates not wrong
p76924
aVBut makes it much more heavy Hector\u2019s opinion
p76925
aVIs this in way of truth yet ne\u2019ertheless
p76926
aVMy sprightly brethren I propend to you
p76927
aVIn resolution to keep Helen still
p76928
aVFor \u2019tis a cause that hath no mean dependence
p76929
aVUpon our joint and several dignities
p76930
aVWhy there you touched the life of our design
p76931
aVWere it not glory that we more affected
p76932
aVThan the performance of our heaving spleens
p76933
aVI would not wish a drop of Trojan blood
p76934
aVSpent more in her defense But worthy Hector
p76935
aVShe is a theme of honor and renown
p76936
aVA spur to valiant and magnanimous deeds
p76937
aVWhose present courage may beat down our foes
p76938
aVAnd fame in time to come canonize us
p76939
aVFor I presume brave Hector would not lose
p76940
aVSo rich advantage of a promised glory
p76941
aVAs smiles upon the forehead of this action
p76942
aVFor the wide world\u2019s revenue
p76943
aVI am yours
p76944
aVYou valiant offspring of great Priamus
p76945
aVI have a roisting challenge sent amongst
p76946
aVThe dull and factious nobles of the Greeks
p76947
aVWill strike amazement to their drowsy spirits
p76948
aVI was advertised their great general slept
p76949
aVWhilst emulation in the army crept
p76950
aVThis I presume will wake him
p76951
aVWhere is Achilles
p76952
aVWithin his tent but ill-disposed my lord
p76953
aVLet it be known to him that we are here
p76954
aVHe shent our messengers and we lay by

aVOur appertainments visiting of him
p76956
aVLet him be told so lest perchance he think
p76957
aVWe dare not move the question of our place
p76958
aVOr know not what we are
p76959
aVI shall say so to him
p76960
aVWe saw him at the opening of his tent
p76961
aVHe is not sick
p76962
aVAchilles bids me say he is much sorry
p76963
aVIf anything more than your sport and pleasure
p76964
aVDid move your greatness and this noble state
p76965
aVTo call upon him He hopes it is no other
p76966
aVBut for your health and your digestion sake
p76967
aVAn after-dinner\u2019s breath
p76968
aVHear you Patroclus
p76969
aVWe are too well acquainted with these answers
p76970
aVBut his evasion winged thus swift with scorn
p76971
aVCannot outfly our apprehensions
p76972
aVMuch attribute he hath and much the reason
p76973
aVWhy we ascribe it to him Yet all his virtues
p76974
aVNot virtuously on his own part beheld
p76975
aVDo in our eyes begin to lose their gloss
p76976
aVYea and like fair fruit in an unwholesome dish
p76977
aVAre like to rot untasted Go and tell him
p76978
aVWe come to speak with him and you shall not sin
p76979
aVIf you do say we think him overproud
p76980
aVAnd underhonest in self-assumption greater
p76981
aVThan in the note of judgment and worthier than himself
p76982
aVHere tend the savage strangeness he puts on
p76983
aVDisguise the holy strength of their command
p76984
aVAnd underwrite in an observing kind

aVRode on his tide Go tell him this and add
p76989
aVThat if he overhold his price so much
p76990
aVWe\u2019ll none of him But let him like an engine

aVAnd yet he loves himself Is \u2019t not strange
p76999
aVAchilles will not to the field tomorrow
p77000
aVWhat\u2019s his excuse
p77001
aVHe doth rely on none
p77002
aVBut carries on the stream of his dispose
p77003
aVWithout observance or respect of any
p77004
aVIn will peculiar and in self-admission
p77005
aVWhy will he not upon our fair request
p77006
aVUntent his person and share th\u2019 air with us
p77007
aVThings small as nothing for request\u2019s sake only
p77008
aVHe makes important Possessed he is with greatness
p77009
aVAnd speaks not to himself but with a pride
p77010
aVThat quarrels at self-breath Imagined worth
p77011
aVHolds in his blood such swoll\u2019n and hot discourse
p77012
aVThat \u2019twixt his mental and his active parts

aVKingdomed Achilles in commotion rages
p77014

p77032
aVAs amply titled as Achilles is
p77033
aVBy going to Achilles
p77034

aVMy lord you feed too much on this dislike
p77048
aVOur noble general do not do so

aVIf I confess much you will play the tyrant

aVWhy have I blabbed Who shall be true to us

aVWhen we are so unsecret to ourselves

aVWell know they what they speak that speak so wisely

aVSo do each lord and either greet him not

aVOr else disdainfully which shall shake him more
p77269
aVThan if not looked on I will lead the way
p77270
aVWhat comes the General to speak with me
p77271
aVYou know my mind I\u2019ll fight no more \u2019gainst Troy
p77272
aVWhat says Achilles Would he aught with us
p77273
aVWould you my lord aught with the General
p77274
aVHow now Patroclus
p77275
aVWhat mean these fellows Know they not Achilles
p77276
aVThey pass by strangely They were used to bend
p77277
aVTo send their smiles before them to Achilles

aVTo come as humbly as they use to creep
p77279
aVTo holy altars
p77280
aVWhat am I poor of late
p77281
aV\u2019Tis certain greatness once fall\u2019n out with Fortune
p77282
aVMust fall out with men too What the declined is
p77283
aVHe shall as soon read in the eyes of others
p77284
aVAs feel in his own fall for men like butterflies
p77285
aVShow not their mealy wings but to the summer
p77286
aVAnd not a man for being simply man
p77287
aVHath any honor but honor for those honors
p77288
aVThat are without him as place riches and favor
p77289
aVPrizes of accident as oft as merit
p77290
aVWhich when they fall as being slippery slanders
p77291
aVThe love that leaned on them as slippery too
p77292
aVDoth one pluck down another and together
p77293
aVDie in the fall But \u2019tis not so with me
p77294
aVFortune and I are friends I do enjoy
p77295
aVAt ample point all that I did possess
p77296
aVSave these men\u2019s looks who do methinks find out
p77297
aVSomething not worth in me such rich beholding
p77298
aVAs they have often given Here is Ulysses
p77299
aVI\u2019ll interrupt his reading How now Ulysses
p77300
aVNow great Thetis\u2019 son
p77301
aVWhat are you reading
p77302
aVA strange fellow here
p77303
aVWrites me that man how dearly ever parted
p77304
aVHow much in having or without or in
p77305
aVCannot make boast to have that which he hath
p77306
aVNor feels not what he owes but by reflection
p77307
aVAs when his virtues shining upon others
p77308
aVHeat them and they retort that heat again
p77309
aVTo the first giver
p77310
aVThis is not strange Ulysses
p77311
aVThe beauty that is borne here in the face
p77312
aVThe bearer knows not but commends itself
p77313
aVTo others\u2019 eyes nor doth the eye itself
p77314
aVThat most pure spirit of sense behold itself
p77315
aVNot going from itself but eye to eye opposed

aVSalutes each other with each other\u2019s form
p77317
aVFor speculation turns not to itself
p77318
aVTill it hath traveled and is mirrored there
p77319
aVWhere it may see itself This is not strange at all
p77320
aVI do not strain at the position
p77321
aVIt is familiar but at the author\u2019s drift
p77322
aVWho in his circumstance expressly proves
p77323
aVThat no man is the lord of anything
p77324
aVThough in and of him there be much consisting
p77325
aVTill he communicate his parts to others
p77326
aVNor doth he of himself know them for aught

aVTill he behold them formed in the applause
p77328
aVWhere they\u2019re extended who like an arch reverb\u2019rate
p77329
aVThe voice again or like a gate of steel
p77330
aVFronting the sun receives and renders back
p77331
aVHis figure and his heat I was much rapt in this
p77332
aVAnd apprehended here immediately
p77333
aVTh\u2019 unknown Ajax Heavens what a man is there
p77334
aVA very horse that has he knows not what
p77335
aVNature what things there are
p77336
aVMost abject in regard and dear in use
p77337
aVWhat things again most dear in the esteem
p77338
aVAnd poor in worth Now shall we see tomorrow
p77339
aVAn act that very chance doth throw upon him
p77340
aVAjax renowned O heavens what some men do
p77341
aVWhile some men leave to do
p77342
aVHow some men creep in skittish Fortune\u2019s hall
p77343
aVWhiles others play the idiots in her eyes
p77344
aVHow one man eats into another\u2019s pride
p77345
aVWhile pride is fasting in his wantonness
p77346
aVTo see these Grecian lords why even already
p77347
aVThey clap the lubber Ajax on the shoulder
p77348
aVAs if his foot were on brave Hector\u2019s breast
p77349
aVAnd great Troy shrieking
p77350
aVI do believe it for they passed by me
p77351
aVAs misers do by beggars neither gave to me
p77352
aVGood word nor look What are my deeds forgot
p77353
aVTime hath my lord a wallet at his back
p77354
aVWherein he puts alms for oblivion
p77355
aVA great-sized monster of ingratitudes
p77356
aVThose scraps are good deeds past which are devoured
p77357
aVAs fast as they are made forgot as soon
p77358
aVAs done Perseverance dear my lord
p77359
aVKeeps honor bright To have done is to hang
p77360
aVQuite out of fashion like a rusty mail
p77361
aVIn monumental mock\u2019ry Take the instant way
p77362
aVFor honor travels in a strait so narrow
p77363
aVWhere one but goes abreast Keep then the path
p77364
aVFor Emulation hath a thousand sons
p77365
aVThat one by one pursue If you give way
p77366
aVOr turn aside from the direct forthright
p77367
aVLike to an entered tide they all rush by
p77368
aVAnd leave you hindmost
p77369
aVOr like a gallant horse fall\u2019n in first rank
p77370
aVLie there for pavement to the abject rear
p77371
aVO\u2019errun and trampled on Then what they do in present
p77372
aVThough less than yours in past must o\u2019ertop yours
p77373
aVFor Time is like a fashionable host
p77374
aVThat slightly shakes his parting guest by th\u2019 hand
p77375
aVAnd with his arms outstretched as he would fly
p77376
aVGrasps in the comer Welcome ever smiles
p77377
aVAnd Farewell goes out sighing Let not virtue seek
p77378
aVRemuneration for the thing it was
p77379
aVFor beauty wit
p77380
aVHigh birth vigor of bone desert in service
p77381
aVLove friendship charity are subjects all
p77382
aVTo envious and calumniating Time
p77383
aVOne touch of nature makes the whole world kin
p77384
aVThat all with one consent praise newborn gauds
p77385
aVThough they are made and molded of things past
p77386
aVAnd give to dust that is a little gilt
p77387
aVMore laud than gilt o\u2019erdusted
p77388
aVThe present eye praises the present object
p77389
aVThen marvel not thou great and complete man
p77390
aVThat all the Greeks begin to worship Ajax
p77391
aVSince things in motion sooner catch the eye
p77392
aVThan what stirs not The cry went once on thee
p77393
aVAnd still it might and yet it may again
p77394
aVIf thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive
p77395
aVAnd case thy reputation in thy tent
p77396
aVWhose glorious deeds but in these fields of late
p77397
aVMade emulous missions \u2019mongst the gods themselves
p77398
aVAnd drave great Mars to faction
p77399
aVOf this my privacy
p77400
aVI have strong reasons
p77401
aVBut \u2019gainst your privacy
p77402
aVThe reasons are more potent and heroical
p77403
aV\u2019Tis known Achilles that you are in love
p77404
aVWith one of Priam\u2019s daughters
p77405
aVHa Known
p77406
aVIs that a wonder
p77407
aVThe providence that\u2019s in a watchful state
p77408
aVKnows almost every grain of Pluto\u2019s gold
p77409
aVFinds bottom in the uncomprehensive deep
p77410
aVKeeps place with thought and almost like the gods
p77411
aVDo thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles
p77412
aVThere is a mystery with whom relation
p77413
aVDurst never meddle in the soul of state
p77414
aVWhich hath an operation more divine
p77415
aVThan breath or pen can give expressure to
p77416
aVAll the commerce that you have had with Troy
p77417
aVAs perfectly is ours as yours my lord
p77418
aVAnd better would it fit Achilles much
p77419
aVTo throw down Hector than Polyxena
p77420
aVBut it must grieve young Pyrrhus now at home
p77421
aVWhen Fame shall in our islands sound her trump
p77422
aVAnd all the Greekish girls shall tripping sing
p77423
aVGreat Hector\u2019s sister did Achilles win
p77424
aVBut our great Ajax bravely beat down him
p77425
aVFarewell my lord I as your lover speak
p77426
aVThe fool slides o\u2019er the ice that you should break
p77427
aVTo this effect Achilles have I moved you
p77428
aVA woman impudent and mannish grown
p77429
aVIs not more loathed than an effeminate man
p77430
aVIn time of action I stand condemned for this
p77431
aVThey think my little stomach to the war
p77432
aVAnd your great love to me restrains you thus
p77433
aVSweet rouse yourself and the weak wanton Cupid
p77434
aVShall from your neck unloose his amorous fold
p77435
aVAnd like a dewdrop from the lion\u2019s mane
p77436
aVBe shook to air
p77437
aVShall Ajax fight with Hector
p77438
aVAy and perhaps receive much honor by him
p77439
aVI see my reputation is at stake
p77440
aVMy fame is shrewdly gored
p77441
aVO then beware
p77442
aVThose wounds heal ill that men do give themselves
p77443
aVOmission to do what is necessary
p77444
aVSeals a commission to a blank of danger
p77445
aVAnd danger like an ague subtly taints
p77446
aVEven then when they sit idly in the sun
p77447
aVGo call Thersites hither sweet Patroclus
p77448
aVI\u2019ll send the fool to Ajax and desire him
p77449
aVT\u2019 invite the Trojan lords after the combat
p77450
aVTo see us here unarmed I have a woman\u2019s longing
p77451
aVAn appetite that I am sick withal
p77452
aVTo see great Hector in his weeds of peace
p77453
aVTo talk with him and to behold his visage
p77454
aVEven to my full of view
p77455
aVA labor saved
p77456
aVMy mind is troubled like a fountain stirred
p77457
aVAnd I myself see not the bottom of it
p77458
aVSee ho Who is that there
p77459
aVIt is the Lord Aeneas
p77460
aVIs the Prince there in person
p77461
aVHad I so good occasion to lie long
p77462
aVAs you Prince Paris nothing but heavenly business
p77463
aVShould rob my bedmate of my company
p77464
aVThat\u2019s my mind too Good morrow Lord Aeneas
p77465
aVA valiant Greek Aeneas take his hand
p77466
aVWitness the process of your speech wherein
p77467
aVYou told how Diomed a whole week by days
p77468
aVDid haunt you in the field
p77469
aVHealth to you valiant sir
p77470
aVDuring all question of the gentle truce
p77471
aVBut when I meet you armed as black defiance
p77472
aVAs heart can think or courage execute
p77473
aVThe one and other Diomed embraces
p77474
aVOur bloods are now in calm and so long health
p77475
aVBut when contention and occasion meet
p77476
aVBy Jove I\u2019ll play the hunter for thy life
p77477
aVWith all my force pursuit and policy
p77478
aVAnd thou shalt hunt a lion that will fly
p77479
aVWith his face backward In human gentleness
p77480
aVWelcome to Troy Now by Anchises\u2019 life
p77481
aVWelcome indeed By Venus\u2019 hand I swear
p77482
aVNo man alive can love in such a sort
p77483
aVThe thing he means to kill more excellently
p77484
aVWe sympathize Jove let Aeneas live
p77485
aVIf to my sword his fate be not the glory
p77486
aVA thousand complete courses of the sun
p77487
aVBut in mine emulous honor let him die
p77488
aVWith every joint a wound and that tomorrow
p77489
aVWe know each other well
p77490
aVWe do and long to know each other worse
p77491
aVThis is the most despiteful gentle greeting
p77492
aVThe noblest hateful love that e\u2019er I heard of
p77493
aVTo Aeneas What business lord so early
p77494
aVI was sent for to the King but why I know not
p77495
aVHis purpose meets you \u2019Twas to bring this Greek
p77496
aVTo Calchas\u2019 house and there to render him
p77497
aVFor the enfreed Antenor the fair Cressid
p77498
aVLet\u2019s have your company or if you please
p77499
aVHaste there before us Aside to Aeneas I constantly believe
p77500
aVOr rather call my thought a certain knowledge
p77501
aVMy brother Troilus lodges there tonight
p77502
aVRouse him and give him note of our approach
p77503
aVWith the whole quality whereof I fear
p77504
aVWe shall be much unwelcome
p77505
aVThat I assure you
p77506
aVTroilus had rather Troy were borne to Greece
p77507
aVThan Cressid borne from Troy
p77508
aVThere is no help
p77509
aVThe bitter disposition of the time
p77510
aVWill have it so On lord we\u2019ll follow you

p77514
aVWho in your thoughts deserves fair Helen best
p77515
aVMyself or Menelaus

aVBoth alike
p77517
aVHe merits well to have her that doth seek her
p77518
aVNot making any scruple of her soilure
p77519
aVWith such a hell of pain and world of charge
p77520
aVAnd you as well to keep her that defend her
p77521
aVNot palating the taste of her dishonor
p77522
aVWith such a costly loss of wealth and friends
p77523
aVHe like a puling cuckold would drink up
p77524
aVThe lees and dregs of a flat tamèd piece
p77525
aVYou like a lecher out of whorish loins
p77526
aVAre pleased to breed out your inheritors
p77527
aVBoth merits poised each weighs nor less nor more
p77528
aVBut he as he the heavier for a whore
p77529
aVYou are too bitter to your countrywoman
p77530
aVShe\u2019s bitter to her country Hear me Paris
p77531
aVFor every false drop in her bawdy veins
p77532
aVA Grecian\u2019s life hath sunk for every scruple
p77533
aVOf her contaminated carrion weight

aVAs for her Greeks and Trojans suffered death
p77537
aVFair Diomed you do as chapmen do
p77538
aVDispraise the thing that they desire to buy
p77539
aVBut we in silence hold this virtue well
p77540
aVWe\u2019ll not commend that not intend to sell
p77541
aVHere lies our way

aVDear trouble not yourself The morn is cold

p77605
aVIf ever she leave Troilus Time force and death
p77606
aVDo to this body what extremes you can
p77607
aVBut the strong base and building of my love
p77608
aVIs as the very center of the Earth
p77609
aVDrawing all things to it I\u2019ll go in and weep

aVAnd would as I shall pity I could help

aVPlease you walk in my lords
p77626
aVWhy tell you me of moderation
p77627
aVThe grief is fine full perfect that I taste

aVAnd violenteth in a sense as strong
p77629
aVAs that which causeth it How can I moderate it

aVAnd is it true that I must go from Troy
p77644
aVA hateful truth
p77645
aVWhat and from Troilus too
p77646
aVFrom Troy and Troilus

p77651
aVOf all rejoindure forcibly prevents

aVOur locked embrasures strangles our dear vows
p77653
aVEven in the birth of our own laboring breath
p77654
aVWe two that with so many thousand sighs
p77655
aVDid buy each other must poorly sell ourselves
p77656
aVWith the rude brevity and discharge of one
p77657
aVInjurious Time now with a robber\u2019s haste

aVI speak not Be thou true as fearing thee
p77677
aVFor I will throw my glove to Death himself

aVTheir loving well composed with gift of nature flowing
p77693
aVAnd swelling o\u2019er with arts and exercise
p77694
aVHow novelty may move and parts with person

aVWhich I beseech you call a virtuous sin

aVO heavens you love me not
p77699
aVDie I a villain then

aVIn this I do not call your faith in question

aVNor heel the high lavolt nor sweeten talk
p77703
aVNor play at subtle games fair virtues all
p77704
aVTo which the Grecians are most prompt and pregnant
p77705
aVBut I can tell that in each grace of these
p77706
aVThere lurks a still and dumb-discursive devil
p77707
aVThat tempts most cunningly But be not tempted
p77708
aVDo you think I will
p77709
aVNo
p77710
aVBut something may be done that we will not
p77711
aVAnd sometimes we are devils to ourselves
p77712
aVWhen we will tempt the frailty of our powers

aVWhilst some with cunning gild their copper crowns
p77724
aVWith truth and plainness I do wear mine bare

p77851
aVWhich way would Hector have it
p77852
aVHe cares not he\u2019ll obey conditions
p77853
aV\u2019Tis done like Hector
p77854
aVBut securely done
p77855
aVA little proudly and great deal misprizing
p77856
aVThe knight opposed
p77857
aVIf not Achilles sir
p77858
aVWhat is your name
p77859
aVIf not Achilles nothing

aVTherefore Achilles But whate\u2019er know this

aVIn the extremity of great and little

aVValor and pride excel themselves in Hector
p77863
aVThe one almost as infinite as all
p77864
aVThe other blank as nothing Weigh him well
p77865
aVAnd that which looks like pride is courtesy
p77866
aVThis Ajax is half made of Hector\u2019s blood
p77867
aVIn love whereof half Hector stays at home
p77868
aVHalf heart half hand half Hector comes to seek
p77869
aVThis blended knight half Trojan and half Greek
p77870
aVA maiden battle then O I perceive you
p77871
aVHere is Sir Diomed Go gentle knight
p77872
aVStand by our Ajax As you and Lord Aeneas
p77873
aVConsent upon the order of their fight
p77874
aVSo be it either to the uttermost
p77875
aVOr else a breath The combatants being kin
p77876
aVHalf stints their strife before their strokes begin
p77877
aVThey are opposed already
p77878
aVWhat Trojan is that same that looks so heavy
p77879
aVThe youngest son of Priam a true knight
p77880
aVNot yet mature yet matchless firm of word
p77881
aVSpeaking in deeds and deedless in his tongue
p77882
aVNot soon provoked nor being provoked soon calmed
p77883
aVHis heart and hand both open and both free
p77884
aVFor what he has he gives what thinks he shows
p77885
aVYet gives he not till judgment guide his bounty
p77886
aVNor dignifies an impair thought with breath
p77887
aVManly as Hector but more dangerous
p77888
aVFor Hector in his blaze of wrath subscribes
p77889
aVTo tender objects but he in heat of action
p77890
aVIs more vindicative than jealous love
p77891
aVThey call him Troilus and on him erect
p77892
aVA second hope as fairly built as Hector
p77893
aVThus says Aeneas one that knows the youth
p77894
aVEven to his inches and with private soul

aVDid in great Ilium thus translate him to me
p77896
aVThey are in action

p77902
aVI am not warm yet Let us fight again

aVAs Hector pleases

aVWhy then will I no more
p77905
aVThou art great lord my father\u2019s sister\u2019s son
p77906
aVA cousin-german to great Priam\u2019s seed
p77907
aVThe obligation of our blood forbids
p77908
aVA gory emulation \u2019twixt us twain

aVWere thy commixtion Greek and Trojan so

aVThat thou couldst say This hand is Grecian all

aVAnd this is Trojan the sinews of this leg

p77914
aVBounds in my father\u2019s by Jove multipotent
p77915
aVThou shouldst not bear from me a Greekish member
p77916
aVWherein my sword had not impressure made
p77917
aVOf our rank feud But the just gods gainsay
p77918
aVThat any drop thou borrowd\u2019st from thy mother
p77919
aVMy sacred aunt should by my mortal sword
p77920
aVBe drained Let me embrace thee Ajax

aVBy him that thunders thou hast lusty arms

aVNot Neoptolemus so mirable

p77931
aVA thought of added honor torn from Hector
p77932
aVThere is expectance here from both the sides
p77933
aVWhat further you will do
p77934
aVWe\u2019ll answer it
p77935
aVThe issue is embracement Ajax farewell
p77936
aVIf I might in entreaties find success

aVAs seld I have the chance I would desire
p77938
aVMy famous cousin to our Grecian tents

aVThe worthiest of them tell me name by name

p77951
aVWorthy all arms As welcome as to one

aVI have thou gallant Trojan seen thee oft
p77973
aVLaboring for destiny make cruel way
p77974
aVThrough ranks of Greekish youth and I have seen thee
p77975
aVAs hot as Perseus spur thy Phrygian steed
p77976
aVDespising many forfeits and subduments
p77977
aVWhen thou hast hung thy advanced sword i\u2019 th\u2019 air
p77978
aVNot letting it decline on the declined
p77979
aVThat I have said to some my standers-by
p77980
aVLo Jupiter is yonder dealing life
p77981
aVAnd I have seen thee pause and take thy breath
p77982
aVWhen that a ring of Greeks have hemmed thee in
p77983
aVLike an Olympian wrestling This have I seen
p77984
aVBut this thy countenance still locked in steel
p77985
aVI never saw till now I knew thy grandsire
p77986
aVAnd once fought with him he was a soldier good

p78005
aVSir I foretold you then what would ensue
p78006
aVMy prophecy is but half his journey yet

aVMust kiss their own feet
p78010
aVI must not believe you

aVWhy dost thou so oppress me with thine eye
p78034
aVTell me you heavens in which part of his body

aVAh poor our sex This fault in us I find
p78235
aVThe error of our eye directs our mind
p78236
aVWhat error leads must err O then conclude
p78237
aVMinds swayed by eyes are full of turpitude

aVWhy stay we then
p78243
aVTo make a recordation to my soul

aVOf every syllable that here was spoke
p78245
aVBut if I tell how these two did co-act
p78246
aVShall I not lie in publishing a truth
p78247
aVSith yet there is a credence in my heart
p78248
aVAn esperance so obstinately strong
p78249
aVThat doth invert th\u2019 attest of eyes and ears
p78250
aVAs if those organs had deceptious functions
p78251
aVCreated only to calumniate
p78252
aVWas Cressid here
p78253
aVI cannot conjure Trojan
p78254
aVShe was not sure
p78255
aVMost sure she was
p78256
aVWhy my negation hath no taste of madness
p78257
aVNor mine my lord Cressid was here but now
p78258
aVLet it not be believed for womanhood
p78259
aVThink we had mothers Do not give advantage
p78260
aVTo stubborn critics apt without a theme
p78261
aVFor depravation to square the general sex
p78262
aVBy Cressid\u2019s rule Rather think this not Cressid
p78263
aVWhat hath she done prince that can soil our mothers
p78264
aVNothing at all unless that this were she
p78265
aVThis she No this is Diomed\u2019s Cressida
p78266
aVIf beauty have a soul this is not she
p78267
aVIf souls guide vows if vows be sanctimonies
p78268
aVIf sanctimony be the gods\u2019 delight
p78269
aVIf there be rule in unity itself
p78270
aVThis is not she O madness of discourse
p78271
aVThat cause sets up with and against itself
p78272
aVBifold authority where reason can revolt
p78273
aVWithout perdition and loss assume all reason
p78274
aVWithout revolt This is and is not Cressid
p78275
aVWithin my soul there doth conduce a fight
p78276
aVOf this strange nature that a thing inseparate
p78277
aVDivides more wider than the sky and Earth
p78278
aVAnd yet the spacious breadth of this division
p78279
aVAdmits no orifex for a point as subtle
p78280
aVAs Ariachne\u2019s broken woof to enter
p78281
aVInstance O instance strong as Pluto\u2019s gates
p78282
aVCressid is mine tied with the bonds of heaven
p78283
aVInstance O instance strong as heaven itself
p78284
aVThe bonds of heaven are slipped dissolved and loosed
p78285
aVAnd with another knot five-finger-tied
p78286
aVThe fractions of her faith orts of her love
p78287
aVThe fragments scraps the bits and greasy relics
p78288
aVOf her o\u2019er-eaten faith are given to Diomed
p78289
aVMay worthy Troilus be half attached
p78290
aVWith that which here his passion doth express
p78291
aVAy Greek and that shall be divulgèd well
p78292
aVIn characters as red as Mars his heart
p78293
aVInflamed with Venus Never did young man fancy
p78294
aVWith so eternal and so fixed a soul
p78295
aVHark Greek as much as I do Cressid love
p78296
aVSo much by weight hate I her Diomed
p78297
aVThat sleeve is mine that he\u2019ll bear on his helm
p78298
aVWere it a casque composed by Vulcan\u2019s skill
p78299
aVMy sword should bite it Not the dreadful spout
p78300
aVWhich shipmen do the hurricano call
p78301
aVConstringed in mass by the almighty sun
p78302
aVShall dizzy with more clamor Neptune\u2019s ear
p78303
aVIn his descent than shall my prompted sword
p78304
aVFalling on Diomed

aVO Cressid O false Cressid False false false

aVO contain yourself
p78309
aVYour passion draws ears hither
p78310
aVI have been seeking you this hour my lord

aVI\u2019ll bring you to the gates
p78317
aVAccept distracted thanks
p78318
aVWhen was my lord so much ungently tempered
p78319
aVTo stop his ears against admonishment
p78320
aVUnarm unarm and do not fight today
p78321
aVYou train me to offend you Get you in
p78322
aVBy all the everlasting gods I\u2019ll go
p78323
aVMy dreams will sure prove ominous to the day
p78324
aVNo more I say
p78325
aVWhere is my brother Hector
p78326
aVHere sister armed and bloody in intent
p78327
aVConsort with me in loud and dear petition
p78328
aVPursue we him on knees For I have dreamt
p78329
aVOf bloody turbulence and this whole night
p78330
aVHath nothing been but shapes and forms of slaughter
p78331
aVO \u2019tis true
p78332
aVHo Bid my trumpet sound
p78333
aVNo notes of sally for the heavens sweet brother
p78334
aVBegone I say The gods have heard me swear
p78335
aVThe gods are deaf to hot and peevish vows
p78336
aVThey are polluted off\u2019rings more abhorred
p78337
aVThan spotted livers in the sacrifice
p78338
aVO be persuaded Do not count it holy
p78339
aVTo hurt by being just It is as lawful
p78340
aVFor we would give much to use violent thefts
p78341
aVAnd rob in the behalf of charity
p78342
aVIt is the purpose that makes strong the vow
p78343
aVBut vows to every purpose must not hold
p78344
aVUnarm sweet Hector
p78345
aVHold you still I say
p78346
aVMine honor keeps the weather of my fate
p78347
aVLife every man holds dear but the dear man
p78348
aVHolds honor far more precious-dear than life

aVLet grow thy sinews till their knots be strong
p78354
aVAnd tempt not yet the brushes of the war
p78355
aVUnarm thee go and doubt thou not brave boy
p78356
aVI\u2019ll stand today for thee and me and Troy
p78357
aVBrother you have a vice of mercy in you
p78358
aVWhich better fits a lion than a man
p78359
aVWhat vice is that Good Troilus chide me for it
p78360
aVWhen many times the captive Grecian falls
p78361
aVEven in the fan and wind of your fair sword
p78362
aVYou bid them rise and live

aVAnd let us two devise to bring him thither
p78735
aVThere is an old tale goes that Herne the Hunter
p78736
aVSometime a keeper here in Windsor Forest
p78737
aVDoth all the wintertime at still midnight
p78738
aVWalk round about an oak with great ragged horns
p78739
aVAnd there he blasts the tree and takes the cattle
p78740
aVAnd makes milch-kine yield blood and shakes a chain
p78741
aVIn a most hideous and dreadful manner
p78742
aVYou have heard of such a spirit and well you know
p78743
aVThe superstitious idle-headed eld
p78744
aVReceived and did deliver to our age
p78745

p78746
aVWhy yet there want not many that do fear
p78747
aVIn deep of night to walk by this Herne\u2019s oak
p78748
aVBut what of this
p78749
aVMarry this is our device
p78750
aVThat Falstaff at that oak shall meet with us
p78751
aVWell let it not be doubted but he\u2019ll come
p78752
aVAnd in this shape when you have brought him thither
p78753
aVWhat shall be done with him What is your plot
p78754
aVThat likewise have we thought upon and thus
p78755

aVTonight at Herne\u2019s oak just \u2019twixt twelve and one
p78811
aVMust my sweet Nan present the Fairy Queen
p78812
aVThe purpose why is here in which disguise
p78813
aVWhile other jests are something rank on foot
p78814
aVHer father hath commanded her to slip
p78815
aVAway with Slender and with him at Eton
p78816
aVImmediately to marry She hath consented Now sir

aVHer mother ever strong against that match
p78818
aVAnd firm for Doctor Caius hath appointed
p78819
aVThat he shall likewise shuffle her away

p78827
aVTo take her by the hand and bid her go
p78828
aVShe shall go with him Her mother hath intended
p78829
aVThe better to denote her to the doctor
p78830
aVFor they must all be masked and vizarded
p78831
aVThat quaint in green she shall be loose enrobed
p78832
aVWith ribbons pendent flaring \u2019bout her head
p78833
aVAnd when the doctor spies his vantage ripe
p78834
aVTo pinch her by the hand and on that token

aVThe truth is she and I long since contracted
p78923
aVAre now so sure that nothing can dissolve us
p78924
aVTh\u2019 offense is holy that she hath committed
p78925
aVAnd this deceit loses the name of craft
p78926
aVOf disobedience or unduteous title
p78927
aVSince therein she doth evitate and shun
p78928
aVA thousand irreligious cursèd hours

aVStand not amazed Here is no remedy

aVAnd bleat the one at th\u2019 other What we changed
p79026
aVWas innocence for innocence We knew not
p79027
aVThe doctrine of ill-doing nor dreamed
p79028
aVThat any did Had we pursued that life
p79029
aVAnd our weak spirits ne\u2019er been higher reared
p79030
aVWith stronger blood we should have answered heaven

aVBoldly Not guilty the imposition cleared
p79032
aVHereditary ours

aVBy this we gather
p79034
aVYou have tripped since
p79035
aVO my most sacred lady

aVTemptations have since then been born to \u2019s for
p79037
aVIn those unfledged days was my wife a girl

aVYour precious self had then not crossed the eyes
p79039
aVOf my young playfellow
p79040
aVGrace to boot

aVOf this make no conclusion lest you say
p79042
aVYour queen and I are devils Yet go on
p79043
aVTh\u2019 offenses we have made you do we\u2019ll answer
p79044

aVOur praises are our wages You may ride \u2019s
p79059
aVWith one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere

aVWith spur we heat an acre But to th\u2019 goal
p79061
aVMy last good deed was to entreat his stay
p79062
aVWhat was my first It has an elder sister
p79063
aVOr I mistake you O would her name were Grace
p79064
aVBut once before I spoke to th\u2019 purpose When

p79069
aVAnd clap thyself my love then didst thou utter

aVToo hot too hot
p79076
aVTo mingle friendship far is mingling bloods
p79077

aVMay a free face put on derive a liberty
p79080
aVFrom heartiness from bounty fertile bosom
p79081
aVAnd well become the agent \u2019T may I grant

aVThe King hath on him such a countenance
p79370
aVAs he had lost some province and a region
p79371
aVLoved as he loves himself Even now I met him
p79372
aVWith customary compliment when he
p79373
aVWafting his eyes to th\u2019 contrary and falling
p79374
aVA lip of much contempt speeds from me and
p79375
aVSo leaves me to consider what is breeding
p79376
aVThat changes thus his manners
p79377
aVI dare not know my lord
p79378
aVHow dare not Do not Do you know and dare not
p79379

p79382
aVYour changed complexions are to me a mirror
p79383
aVWhich shows me mine changed too for I must be

aVMyself thus altered with \u2019t
p79386
aVThere is a sickness
p79387
aVWhich puts some of us in distemper but
p79388
aVI cannot name the disease and it is caught
p79389
aVOf you that yet are well
p79390
aVHow caught of me

p79392
aVI have looked on thousands who have sped the better
p79393
aVBy my regard but killed none so Camillo

aVAs you are certainly a gentleman thereto
p79395
aVClerklike experienced which no less adorns
p79396
aVOur gentry than our parents\u2019 noble names
p79397
aVIn whose success we are gentle I beseech you
p79398
aVIf you know aught which does behoove my knowledge
p79399
aVThereof to be informed imprison \u2019t not
p79400
aVIn ignorant concealment
p79401
aVI may not answer
p79402
aVA sickness caught of me and yet I well
p79403
aVI must be answered Dost thou hear Camillo
p79404
aVI conjure thee by all the parts of man
p79405
aVWhich honor does acknowledge whereof the least
p79406
aVIs not this suit of mine that thou declare
p79407
aVWhat incidency thou dost guess of harm
p79408
aVIs creeping toward me how far off how near
p79409
aVWhich way to be prevented if to be
p79410
aVIf not how best to bear it
p79411
aVSir I will tell you
p79412
aVSince I am charged in honor and by him
p79413
aVThat I think honorable Therefore mark my counsel
p79414
aVWhich must be e\u2019en as swiftly followed as
p79415
aVI mean to utter it or both yourself and me
p79416
aVCry lost and so goodnight
p79417
aVOn good Camillo
p79418
aVI am appointed him to murder you
p79419
aVBy whom Camillo
p79420
aVBy the King
p79421
aVFor what
p79422
aVHe thinks nay with all confidence he swears
p79423
aVAs he had seen \u2019t or been an instrument
p79424
aVTo vice you to \u2019t that you have touched his queen
p79425
aVForbiddenly

aVTurn then my freshest reputation to
p79430
aVA savor that may strike the dullest nostril
p79431
aVWhere I arrive and my approach be shunned
p79432
aVNay hated too worse than the great\u2019st infection
p79433
aVThat e\u2019er was heard or read
p79434
aVSwear his thought over
p79435
aVBy each particular star in heaven and
p79436
aVBy all their influences you may as well
p79437
aVForbid the sea for to obey the moon
p79438
aVAs or by oath remove or counsel shake
p79439
aVThe fabric of his folly whose foundation
p79440
aVIs piled upon his faith and will continue
p79441
aVThe standing of his body
p79442
aVHow should this grow
p79443
aVI know not But I am sure \u2019tis safer to
p79444
aVAvoid what\u2019s grown than question how \u2019tis born

aVHave uttered truth which if you seek to prove
p79455
aVI dare not stand by nor shall you be safer
p79456
aVThan one condemned by the King\u2019s own mouth thereon

p80675
aVYour heart is full of something that does take
p80676
aVYour mind from feasting Sooth when I was young
p80677
aVAnd handed love as you do I was wont
p80678
aVTo load my she with knacks I would have ransacked
p80679
aVThe peddler\u2019s silken treasury and have poured it
p80680
aVTo her acceptance You have let him go
p80681
aVAnd nothing marted with him If your lass

aVInterpretation should abuse and call this
p80683

aVFor a reply at least if you make a care
p80685
aVOf happy holding her

aVOld sir I know

aVBefore this ancient sir who it should seem

aVI was not much afeard for once or twice

aVLooks on alike To Florizell Will \u2019t please you sir be gone

aVI cannot speak nor think
p80806
aVNor dare to know that which I know To Florizell O sir

p80809
aVTo die upon the bed my father died
p80810
aVTo lie close by his honest bones but now
p80811
aVSome hangman must put on my shroud and lay me
p80812
aVWhere no priest shovels in dust To Perdita O cursèd wretch

aVThat knew\u2019st this was the Prince and wouldst adventure
p80814
aVTo mingle faith with him Undone undone

aVIf I might die within this hour I have lived

aVI am but sorry not afeard delayed

aVMy leash unwillingly
p80822
aVGracious my lord
p80823
aVYou know your father\u2019s temper At this time
p80824
aVHe will allow no speech which I do guess
p80825
aVYou do not purpose to him and as hardly
p80826
aVWill he endure your sight as yet I fear
p80827
aVThen till the fury of his Highness settle

aVEven he my lord
p80832
aVHow often have I told you \u2019twould be thus
p80833
aVHow often said my dignity would last
p80834
aVBut till \u2019twere known
p80835
aVIt cannot fail but by
p80836
aVThe violation of my faith and then
p80837
aVLet nature crush the sides o\u2019 th\u2019 Earth together
p80838
aVAnd mar the seeds within Lift up thy looks
p80839
aVFrom my succession wipe me father I
p80840
aVAm heir to my affection
p80841
aVBe advised
p80842
aVI am and by my fancy If my reason
p80843
aVWill thereto be obedient I have reason
p80844
aVIf not my senses better pleased with madness
p80845
aVDo bid it welcome
p80846
aVThis is desperate sir
p80847
aVSo call it but it does fulfill my vow
p80848
aVI needs must think it honesty Camillo
p80849
aVNot for Bohemia nor the pomp that may
p80850
aVBe thereat gleaned for all the sun sees or
p80851
aVThe close earth wombs or the profound seas hides
p80852
aVIn unknown fathoms will I break my oath
p80853
aVTo this my fair beloved Therefore I pray you
p80854
aVAs you have ever been my father\u2019s honored friend
p80855
aVWhen he shall miss me as in faith I mean not
p80856
aVTo see him anymore cast your good counsels
p80857
aVUpon his passion Let myself and fortune
p80858
aVTug for the time to come This you may know
p80859
aVAnd so deliver I am put to sea
p80860
aVWith her who here I cannot hold on shore
p80861
aVAnd most opportune to our need I have
p80862
aVA vessel rides fast by but not prepared
p80863
aVFor this design What course I mean to hold
p80864
aVShall nothing benefit your knowledge nor
p80865
aVConcern me the reporting
p80866
aVO my lord
p80867
aVI would your spirit were easier for advice
p80868
aVOr stronger for your need
p80869
aVHark Perdita
p80870
aVI\u2019ll hear you by and by
p80871
aVHe\u2019s irremovable
p80872
aVResolved for flight Now were I happy if
p80873
aVHis going I could frame to serve my turn
p80874
aVSave him from danger do him love and honor
p80875
aVPurchase the sight again of dear Sicilia
p80876
aVAnd that unhappy king my master whom
p80877
aVI so much thirst to see
p80878
aVNow good Camillo
p80879
aVI am so fraught with curious business that
p80880
aVI leave out ceremony
p80881
aVSir I think
p80882
aVYou have heard of my poor services i\u2019 th\u2019 love
p80883
aVThat I have borne your father
p80884
aVVery nobly
p80885
aVHave you deserved It is my father\u2019s music
p80886
aVTo speak your deeds not little of his care
p80887
aVTo have them recompensed as thought on
p80888
aVWell my lord
p80889
aVIf you may please to think I love the King
p80890
aVAnd through him what\u2019s nearest to him which is
p80891
aVYour gracious self embrace but my direction
p80892
aVIf your more ponderous and settled project
p80893
aVMay suffer alteration On mine honor
p80894
aVI\u2019ll point you where you shall have such receiving
p80895
aVAs shall become your Highness where you may
p80896
aVEnjoy your mistress from the whom I see
p80897
aVThere\u2019s no disjunction to be made but by
p80898
aVAs heavens forfend your ruin marry her
p80899
aVAnd with my best endeavors in your absence
p80900
aVYour discontenting father strive to qualify
p80901
aVAnd bring him up to liking
p80902
aVHow Camillo
p80903
aVMay this almost a miracle be done
p80904
aVThat I may call thee something more than man
p80905
aVAnd after that trust to thee
p80906
aVHave you thought on
p80907
aVA place whereto you\u2019ll go
p80908
aVNot any yet
p80909
aVBut as th\u2019 unthought-on accident is guilty
p80910
aVTo what we wildly do so we profess
p80911
aVOurselves to be the slaves of chance and flies
p80912
aVOf every wind that blows
p80913
aVThen list to me
p80914
aVThis follows if you will not change your purpose
p80915
aVBut undergo this flight make for Sicilia
p80916
aVAnd there present yourself and your fair princess
p80917
aVFor so I see she must be \u2019fore Leontes
p80918
aVShe shall be habited as it becomes
p80919
aVThe partner of your bed Methinks I see
p80920
aVLeontes opening his free arms and weeping
p80921
aVHis welcomes forth asks thee the son forgiveness
p80922
aVAs \u2019twere i\u2019 th\u2019 father\u2019s person kisses the hands
p80923
aVOf your fresh princess o\u2019er and o\u2019er divides him
p80924
aV\u2019Twixt his unkindness and his kindness Th\u2019 one
p80925
aVHe chides to hell and bids the other grow
p80926
aVFaster than thought or time
p80927
aVWorthy Camillo
p80928
aVWhat color for my visitation shall I
p80929
aVHold up before him
p80930
aVSent by the King your father
p80931
aVTo greet him and to give him comforts Sir
p80932
aVThe manner of your bearing towards him with
p80933
aVWhat you as from your father shall deliver
p80934
aVThings known betwixt us three I\u2019ll write you down
p80935
aVThe which shall point you forth at every sitting
p80936
aVWhat you must say that he shall not perceive
p80937
aVBut that you have your father\u2019s bosom there
p80938
aVAnd speak his very heart
p80939
aVI am bound to you
p80940
aVThere is some sap in this
p80941
aVA course more promising
p80942
aVThan a wild dedication of yourselves
p80943
aVTo unpathed waters undreamed shores most certain
p80944
aVTo miseries enough no hope to help you
p80945
aVBut as you shake off one to take another
p80946
aVNothing so certain as your anchors who
p80947
aVDo their best office if they can but stay you
p80948
aVWhere you\u2019ll be loath to be Besides you know
p80949
aVProsperity\u2019s the very bond of love
p80950
aVWhose fresh complexion and whose heart together
p80951
aVAffliction alters
p80952
aVOne of these is true
p80953
aVI think affliction may subdue the cheek
p80954
aVBut not take in the mind
p80955
aVYea say you so
p80956
aVThere shall not at your father\u2019s house these seven years
p80957
aVBe born another such
p80958
aVMy good Camillo
p80959
aVShe\u2019s as forward of her breeding as she is
p80960
aVI\u2019 th\u2019 rear our birth
p80961
aVI cannot say \u2019tis pity
p80962
aVShe lacks instructions for she seems a mistress
p80963
aVTo most that teach
p80964
aVYour pardon sir For this
p80965
aVI\u2019ll blush you thanks
p80966
aVMy prettiest Perdita
p80967
aVBut O the thorns we stand upon Camillo
p80968
aVPreserver of my father now of me
p80969
aVThe medicine of our house how shall we do
p80970
aVWe are not furnished like Bohemia\u2019s son
p80971
aVNor shall appear in Sicilia
p80972
aVMy lord
p80973
aVFear none of this I think you know my fortunes
p80974
aVDo all lie there It shall be so my care
p80975
aVTo have you royally appointed as if
p80976
aVThe scene you play were mine For instance sir
p80977
aVThat you may know you shall not want one word
p80978
aVNay but my letters by this means being there
p80979
aVSo soon as you arrive shall clear that doubt
p80980
aVAnd those that you\u2019ll procure from King Leontes
p80981
aVShall satisfy your father
p80982
aVHappy be you
p80983
aVAll that you speak shows fair
p80984
aVWho have we here
p80985
aVWe\u2019ll make an instrument of this omit
p80986
aVNothing may give us aid
p80987
aVIf they have overheard me now why hanging
p80988
aVUnbuckle unbuckle
p80989
aVFortunate mistress let my prophecy
p80990
aVCome home to you you must retire yourself
p80991
aVInto some covert Take your sweetheart\u2019s hat
p80992
aVAnd pluck it o\u2019er your brows muffle your face
p80993
aVDismantle you and as you can disliken
p80994
aVThe truth of your own seeming that you may
p80995
aVFor I do fear eyes over to shipboard
p80996
aVGet undescried
p80997
aVI see the play so lies
p80998
aVThat I must bear a part
p80999
aVNo remedy
p81000
aVHave you done there
p81001
aVShould I now meet my father
p81002
aVHe would not call me son
p81003
aVNay you shall have no hat
p81004
aVCome lady come Farewell my friend
p81005
aVAdieu sir
p81006
aVO Perdita what have we twain forgot
p81007
aVPray you a word
p81008
aVWhat I do next shall be to tell the King
p81009
aVOf this escape and whither they are bound
p81010
aVWherein my hope is I shall so prevail
p81011
aVTo force him after in whose company
p81012
aVI shall re-view Sicilia for whose sight
p81013
aVI have a woman\u2019s longing
p81014
aVFortune speed us
p81015
aVThus we set on Camillo to th\u2019 seaside
p81016
aVThe swifter speed the better
p81017
aVHow blest are we that are not simple men
p81018
aVYet Nature might have made me as these are
p81019
aVTherefore I will not disdain
p81020
aVSir you have done enough and have performed
p81021
aVA saintlike sorrow No fault could you make
p81022
aVWhich you have not redeemed indeed paid down
p81023
aVMore penitence than done trespass At the last
p81024
aVDo as the heavens have done forget your evil
p81025
aVWith them forgive yourself
p81026
aVWhilst I remember
p81027
aVHer and her virtues I cannot forget
p81028
aVMy blemishes in them and so still think of
p81029
aVThe wrong I did myself which was so much
p81030
aVThat heirless it hath made my kingdom and
p81031
aVDestroyed the sweet\u2019st companion that e\u2019er man
p81032
aVBred his hopes out of
p81033
aVTrue too true my lord
p81034
aVIf one by one you wedded all the world
p81035
aVOr from the all that are took something good
p81036
aVTo make a perfect woman she you killed
p81037
aVWould be unparalleled
p81038
aVI think so Killed
p81039
aVShe I killed I did so but thou strik\u2019st me
p81040
aVSorely to say I did It is as bitter
p81041
aVUpon thy tongue as in my thought Now good now
p81042
aVSay so but seldom
p81043
aVNot at all good lady
p81044
aVYou might have spoken a thousand things that would
p81045
aVHave done the time more benefit and graced
p81046
aVYour kindness better
p81047
aVYou are one of those
p81048
aVWould have him wed again
p81049
aVIf you would not so
p81050
aVYou pity not the state nor the remembrance
p81051
aVOf his most sovereign name consider little
p81052
aVWhat dangers by his Highness\u2019 fail of issue
p81053
aVMay drop upon his kingdom and devour
p81054
aVIncertain lookers-on What were more holy
p81055
aVThan to rejoice the former queen is well
p81056
aVWhat holier than for royalty\u2019s repair
p81057
aVFor present comfort and for future good
p81058
aVTo bless the bed of majesty again
p81059
aVWith a sweet fellow to \u2019t
p81060
aVThere is none worthy
p81061
aVRespecting her that\u2019s gone Besides the gods
p81062
aVWill have fulfilled their secret purposes
p81063
aVFor has not the divine Apollo said
p81064
aVIs \u2019t not the tenor of his oracle
p81065
aVThat King Leontes shall not have an heir
p81066
aVTill his lost child be found Which that it shall
p81067
aVIs all as monstrous to our human reason
p81068
aVAs my Antigonus to break his grave
p81069
aVAnd come again to me who on my life
p81070
aVDid perish with the infant \u2019Tis your counsel
p81071
aVMy lord should to the heavens be contrary
p81072
aVOppose against their wills Care not for issue
p81073
aVThe crown will find an heir Great Alexander
p81074

aVAnd left them
p81083
aVMore rich for what they yielded
p81084
aVThou speak\u2019st truth
p81085
aVNo more such wives therefore no wife One worse

aVAnd better used would make her sainted spirit
p81087
aVAgain possess her corpse and on this stage

aVWhere we offenders now appear soul-vexed

aVAnd begin Why to me
p81090
aVHad she such power
p81091
aVShe had just cause
p81092
aVShe had and would incense me
p81093
aVTo murder her I married

aVWere I the ghost that walked I\u2019d bid you mark

aVIn many singularities but we saw not
p81313
aVThat which my daughter came to look upon
p81314
aVThe statue of her mother
p81315
aVAs she lived peerless
p81316
aVSo her dead likeness I do well believe
p81317
aVExcels whatever yet you looked upon
p81318
aVOr hand of man hath done Therefore I keep it
p81319
aVLonely apart But here it is Prepare

p81327
aVThou art Hermione or rather thou art she
p81328
aVIn thy not chiding for she was as tender
p81329
aVAs infancy and grace But yet Paulina

aVHermione was not so much wrinkled nothing

aVSo agèd as this seems
p81332
aVO not by much
p81333
aVSo much the more our carver\u2019s excellence

aVAs now she might have done
p81337
aVSo much to my good comfort as it is
p81338
aVNow piercing to my soul O thus she stood
p81339
aVEven with such life of majesty warm life
p81340
aVAs now it coldly stands when first I wooed her
p81341
aVI am ashamed Does not the stone rebuke me
p81342
aVFor being more stone than it O royal piece
p81343
aVThere\u2019s magic in thy majesty which has
p81344
aVMy evils conjured to remembrance and
p81345
aVFrom thy admiring daughter took the spirits
p81346
aVStanding like stone with thee
p81347

aVMy lord your sorrow was too sore laid on
p81357
aVWhich sixteen winters cannot blow away
p81358
aVSo many summers dry Scarce any joy
p81359
aVDid ever so long live no sorrow
p81360
aVBut killed itself much sooner
p81361
aVDear my brother
p81362
aVLet him that was the cause of this have power
p81363
aVTo take off so much grief from you as he
p81364
aVWill piece up in himself
p81365
aVIndeed my lord
p81366

p81380
aVAs we are mocked with art
p81381
aVI\u2019ll draw the curtain

aVI am sorry sir I have thus far stirred you but
p81389
aVI could afflict you farther

p81394
aVCould ever yet cut breath Let no man mock me
p81395
aVFor I will kiss her
p81396
aVGood my lord forbear
p81397
aVThe ruddiness upon her lip is wet
p81398
aVYou\u2019ll mar it if you kiss it stain your own

aVWith oily painting Shall I draw the curtain
p81400
aVNo not these twenty years

aVEither forbear
p81404
aVQuit presently the chapel or resolve you
p81405
aVFor more amazement If you can behold it
p81406
aVI\u2019ll make the statue move indeed descend
p81407
aVAnd take you by the hand But then you\u2019ll think
p81408
aVWhich I protest against I am assisted
p81409
aVBy wicked powers
p81410
aVWhat you can make her do
p81411
aVI am content to look on what to speak
p81412
aVI am content to hear for \u2019tis as easy
