Shall I lay perjury upon my soul

James Tyrrel and your most obedient subject

Mine issue of your blood upon your daughter

For lords tomorrow is a busy day

With ignominious words though clerkly couched

The rest shall bear the business in some other fight

Hang thee monster

For as thou urgest justice be assured

His going I could frame to serve my turn

I am dying Egypt dying Only

I will talk further with you

Leave not a rack behind We are such stuff

He is not here

And the Athenian woman by his side

A fool of thee Depart

As humorous as winter and as sudden

And which became him like a prince indeed

My lord these faults are easy quickly answered

What foul play had we that we came from thence

Guarded with grandsires babies and old women

Master of this design did give us with

My widow-comfort and my sorrows' cure

And O what better matter breeds for you

We'll serve Him too and be his fellow so

The Tuscan service freely have they leave

When the day serves before black-cornered night

And to obey shall be in me remorse

Madam yourself is not exempt from this

But tell me whom thou seek'st

In all this noble bevy has brought with her

Place barrels of pitch upon the fatal stake

With variable complexions all agreeing

So that but one heart we can make of it

Wherefore they do it They could be content

I do not like her She doth think she has

What now remains my lords for us to do

![](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7650/17249016955_2f6c2eec71.jpg)

To conjure tears up in a poor maid's eyes

From off these fields where wretches their poor bodies

For I myself will hunt this wolf to death

But your discretions better can persuade

Many good morrows to my noble lord

And every day do honor to her grave

![](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7615/16626552034_afec7e2044.jpg)

Courses as swift as thought in every power

To chide my fortune and torment myself

Good repose the while

Why now thou hast unwished five thousand men

Because that John hath made his peace with Rome

Methinks his Lordship should be humbler

And made their bends adornings At the helm

And by my faith this league that we have made

As every present time doth boast itself

As all things shall redound unto your good

And nothing can or shall content my soul

And left sweet Pyramus translated there

But my lord

Gloves as sweet as damask roses

And dare me to the desert with thy sword

But that my heart's on future mischief set

Fools on both sides Helen must needs be fair

Which like a waxen image 'gainst a fire

To pluck bright honor from the pale-faced moon

Both her sweet hands her tongue and that more dear

Alcides thou mine ancestor thy rage

Is but a little way above our heads

This bodiless creation ecstasy

His own opinion was his law I' th' presence

![](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/683/20474195303_067f3f3683.jpg)

He is indeed and living to kill thee

Excellent

Your wife is like to reap a proper man

Even so void is your false heart of truth

Baked and impasted with the parching streets

Than when you left him Even now he sung

![](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/651/20472655464_7000d3143d.jpg)

Shall rue the hour that ever thou wast born

And give him from me this most needful note

Fluttered your Volscians in Corioles

Colleagu√®d with this dream of his advantage

To Persia and want guilders for my voyage

And send the hearers weeping to their beds

![](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/643/20908473309_0a4802b566.jpg)

And therefore is Love said to be a child

I cry you mercy madam Was it you

Than youthful April shall with all his showers

Thou Richard shalt to the Duke of Norfolk

This sword and these my wounds Let th' Egyptians

To his new kingdom of ne'er-changing night

![](https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5749/21102970061_e58c5e4495.jpg)

Within this hour my man shall be with thee

By your leave hostess

'Twixt this and supper Go not my horse the better

What wouldst thou

Yet am I thankful If my heart were great

The poet's eye in a fine frenzy rolling

![](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/725/20472658934_553a0c3b24.jpg)

Hold here's more gold for thee

The youth says well Now hear our English king

Have travailed in the great shower of your gifts

That judgment cannot cure Which thing to do

Where

Well could I leave our sport to sleep awhile

![](https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5697/21069084686_9ed471bb90.jpg)

Away then Come seek the conspirators

Till honor be bought up and no sword worn

Not separated with the racking clouds

Ay let the County take you in your bed

Pray God she prove not masculine ere long

Fall into taint which to believe of her

![](https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5806/20474201143_70272698b1.jpg)

Yea without stop didst let thy heart consent

More counsel with more money bounteous Timon

Your man and you are marvelous merry sir

Adieu adieu adieu Thisbe falls

He shall have merely justice and his bond

Requires slow pace at first Anger is like

![](https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5780/20472662424_dca72a901d.jpg)

For when no friends are by men praise themselves

Enough to make a whore forswear her trade

And therein negligent or else a fool

While greasy Joan doth keel the pot

Ay by my faith that bears a frosty sound

Grief joys joy grieves on slender accident

![](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/604/21085217682_253fe3e408.jpg)

The people cry you mocked them and of late

Kent father sisters What i' th' storm i' th' night

And most desire should meet the blow of justice

Surety secure but modest doubt is called

That thou provok'st thyself to cast him up

Great lords from Ireland am I come amain

![](https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5698/21069088636_4cd772e004.jpg)

And to my state grew stranger being transported

O ten times faster Venus' pigeons fly

Which at the first are scarce found to distaste

Give dreadful note of preparation

Honest Iago

Of his true titles to some certain dukedoms

![](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/588/20908481669_0a8be82a7c.jpg)

Turn head and stop pursuit for coward dogs

When time is ripe which will be suddenly

Cuts off the ceremonious vows of love

If she be curst it is for policy

As long a term as yet we have to live

What keep a week away Seven days and nights

![](https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5669/20474205753_9e63888fef.jpg)

That none shall have access unto Bianca

And take the shame with joy

Let it be so And you my noble prince

With such a careless force and forceless care

But mine shall be a comfort to your age

Fire burn and cauldron bubble

![](https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5729/21069090866_74802bcda6.jpg)

And now methinks I have a mind to it

A good blunt fellow Why being younger born

That takes away by any secret course

Art thou certain this is true Is 't most certain

There's none Protector of the realm but I

When thou wert regent for our sovereign

![](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/665/21095238375_6de42a7ffd.jpg)

O she's warm

The barks of trees thou brows√®d On the Alps

'Twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them

Unto the wish√®d haven of my bliss

Nay I have verses too I thank Berowne

With this affair along For all our thanks

![](https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5718/21102979441_baf7389299.jpg)

My wedded lord I ne'er shall see again

Ere the ninth hour I drunk him to his bed

But you at your sick service had a prince

Ay my lord

Nor claim no further than your new-fall'n right

Now perjured Henry wilt thou kneel for grace

![](https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5638/21085223272_cf35cce5da.jpg)

Let me be counted serviceable How look I

Some speedy messenger bid her repair

Here under leave of Brutus and the rest

Thou lay'st in every gash that love hath given me

Ay

A father and a friend to thee and Rome

![](https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5683/20472668954_d4c1aaa18e.jpg)

Dark night that from the eye his function takes

And grew a twenty years' remov√®d thing

High on a stage be placed to the view

That my integrity and truth to you

Was he not held a learn√®d man

The Cardinal's and Sir Thomas Lovell's heads

![](https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5621/21069094686_9a93914a03.jpg)

But if you be afeard to hear the worst

And he will after his sour fashion tell you

An elder than herself So wears she to him

Not on a band but on a stronger thing

The bitter sentence of poor Clarence' death

Look here comes one a gentlewoman of mine

![](https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5680/20472670894_5a38a5ec51.jpg)

'Tis but her picture I have yet beheld

When gouty keepers of thee cannot stand

With gentle conference soft and affable

Why do fond men expose themselves to battle

It is reported thou didst eat strange flesh

Like to an entered tide they all rush by

![](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/702/21102983471_e2b9ee5794.jpg)

Not body's death but body's banishment

I trod upon a worm against my will

You have here lady

Yet to supply the ripe wants of my friend

But I protest he had the chain of me

Most piteous to be wild I have dispatched in post

![](https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5693/21048699271_e449c808fa.jpg)

A kinder value of the people than

Thy biddings have been done and every hour

You won it wore it kept it gave it me

That spoiled your summer fields and fruitful vines

And I with all unwillingness will go

Save me and hover o'er me with your wings

![](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/566/21041085045_7ee776c284.jpg)

'Twas I but 'tis not I I do not shame

I rather think

Away away be gone

Tomorrow shall you bear our full intent

Since now we will divest us both of rule

Whatever fortune stays him from his word

![](https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5711/20418445814_5ea9978899.jpg)

To answer twenty thousand such as you

From men of royal siege and my demerits

This is most certain that I shall deliver

Nothing What news

That thou art banish√®d O that's the news

Ophelia walk you here Gracious so please you

![](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/595/20420025873_6c7e0c039b.jpg)

To know his pleasure and in that behalf

Good Master Doctor see him safe conveyed

The act of order to a peopled kingdom

If you should die before him where's her dower

The sweet and bitter fool

Waste it for you like taper light

![](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/607/20854277649_2224fc9a1a.jpg)

Either led or driven as we point the way

Good madam hear me

No longer stay

And what of him Tranio

My utmost skill in his recovery provided

Tell Athens in the sequence of degree

![](https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5738/20418449294_f39ca8efa3.jpg)

For then I should not love thee no nor thou

Is all too wanton and too full of gauds

Prithee have done

Earth's increase foison plenty

And bid me hold my peace I pray you all

And he that slew them fouler than he is

![](https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5757/20852977880_cd6992632c.jpg)

Pursuit would be but vain

My griev√®d ear withal whereon I begged

What good could they pretend

Because it is an enemy to thee

Not he I hope

And therefore take this compact of a truce

![](https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5623/20418453874_335b66de1d.jpg)

Yet not the son I will not call him son

No Titus no the Emperor needs her not

In the King's business

News from Verona How now Balthasar

Thy words I grant are bigger for I wear not

For if I do I'll mar the young clerk's pen

No never such an oath nor will not now

With such austerity as 'longeth to a father

May the winds blow till they have wakened death

In whose success we are gentle I beseech you

Will they return

What kind of catechizing call you this

They bear the mandate they must sweep my way

I'll steal away

As is delivered to your Majesty

The Duke of Alanson flieth to his side

Make periods in the midst of sentences

By your own true affections and that your minds

Who with her head nimble in threats approached

I think it is the weakness of mine eyes

Almost at odds with morning which is which

To be by oath enjoined to this Farewell

Folly in fools bears not so strong a note

And swelling o'er with arts and exercise

I should not die but in Jerusalem

But to make open proclamation

If only to go warm were gorgeous

Who's that that bears the scepter

The other must be held the worthier

It is You lie you lie

When my poor heart no measure keeps in grief

If not shun me and I will spare your haunts

Hopeless and helpless doth Egeon wend

Perhaps they had ere this but that they stay

Did you too much disquiet For that you must

Of monstrous lust the due and just reward

Such a one they all confess

I might have saved her Now she's gone forever

As might have drawn one to a longer voyage

With all my love I do commend me to you

I will send him hither to you presently

Disguise fair nature with hard-favored rage

But mantled in your own

The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead

![](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/645/20418468084_b7ee05dff8.jpg)

That rubbing the poor itch of your opinion

'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have pronounced

And fit you to your manhood May the gods

Deservedly confined into this rock

Or else was wrangling Somerset in th' error

Master go on and I will follow thee

And touched with choler hot as gunpowder

One part of Aquitaine is bound to us

As I confess it is my nature's plague

Strike the proud cedars 'gainst the fiery sun

No for he could not so resign his crown

But let them measure us by what they will

If you do wrongfully seize Hereford's rights

And look how well my garments sit upon me

Then let him know and tell him Timon speaks it

Make our eyes flow with joy hearts dance with comforts

Good meat sir is common that every churl affords

Lucius Lucullus and Sempronius all

So went to bed where eagerly his sickness

If anything more than your sport and pleasure

Whereof you are a well-deserving pillar

That they do hold their course toward Tewkesbury

Within the Temple Hall we were too loud

And he a prince and ruler of the land

Let them be hunted soundly At this hour

Take no unkindness of his hasty words

Well sir this gentleman is come to me

If you will bless me sir and give me leave

And save poor me the weaker

Ill-spirited Worcester did not we send grace

A man that all his time

Why such and such and the contents o' th' story

And be you kings command and I'll obey

The image of his maker hope to win by it

To fight against this guilty homicide

The other eye of Gloucester

So will I turn her virtue into pitch

You have stood your limitation and the Tribunes

Hang out our banners on the outward walls

To take advantage of the absent time

That scald'st with safety By his gates of breath

The trumpet sounds Be masked the maskers come

Huntsman I charge thee tender well my hounds

Where one on his side fights thousands will fly

Now heaven forfend the holy maid with child

Pursued my humor not pursuing his

We now present Those that can pity here

Did with the least affection of a welcome

And fled as he hears since to Burgundy

That virtuous Lady Bona thy fair sister

That it may please you leave these sad designs

Troilus by Menelaus

And fall on my side so against your will

If e'er thou stand at mercy of my sword

Blows you to Padua here from old Verona

For she's a woman to be pitied much

Some officers take them away Good guard

I have read three hours then Mine eyes are weak

Hath looked upon my passes Then good prince

Your sudden coming-o'er to play with you

Our house is hell and thou a merry devil

So shalt thou sinew both these lands together

That did oppose my will Better Macbeth

![](https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3821/19937526708_8b6acfc7e4.jpg)

And I expressly am forbid to touch it

Come you are deceived I think of no such thing

Descended from the Duke of Clarence' house

Thy grave admonishments prevail with me

This is a way to kill a wife with kindness

Tut I can counterfeit the deep tragedian

![](https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3704/19937610480_c4b5e14572.jpg)

Have loved without this mean if on both parts

He offers in another's enterprise

From her propriety What is the matter masters

Darkness and devils

You must not be so quick

There is a lord will hear you play tonight

![](https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3828/19502981354_df9693995f.jpg)

Yet by reputing of his high descent

Is it your trick to make me ope the door

Within this mile break forth a hundred springs

Vouchsafe to speak my thanks and my obedience

I that do bring the news made not the match

Till George be packed with post-horse up to heaven

![](https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3673/19937529258_117fbd7d85.jpg)

Time calls upon 's

O my lord

Th' idea of her life shall sweetly creep

Domestic awe night rest and neighborhood

Or bring him off Fate hear me what I say

Imperious Caesar dead and turned to clay

![](https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3752/20099342096_baff635624.jpg)

For 'tis a bond in men Give him thy daughter

Patience is sottish and impatience does

Unto the Prince's heart of Calydon

Then by myself

A woman's story at a winter's fire

As then your force did Take that life beseech you

Out of a great deal of old iron I chose forth

Come mourn with me for what I do lament

And God forbid my dear and faithful lord

Life and these lips have long been separated

And when I have stol'n upon these son-in-laws

Are brought to the correction of your law

![](https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3811/20131145271_5037bc530a.jpg)

Come lady come Farewell my friend

And you all know security

With all the strength and armor of the mind

To suffer with him Good love call him back

In double knavery How how Let's see

Are nursed by baseness Thou 'rt by no means valiant

![](https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3822/20125630635_d90bba2a15.jpg)

Mine eyes should sparkle like the beaten flint

No faith no honesty in men All perjured

Splits what it speaks The wild disguise hath almost

And bring some covering for this naked soul

Dear general I never gave you cause

A merriment than a vice

![](https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3679/20131147301_ce48a3e98d.jpg)

Then sigh not so but let them go

We two in great amazedness will fly

Defective in their natures grow to wildness

Jewel of children seen this hour he had paired

To find the empty vast and wand'ring air

We honor you with trouble But we came

![](https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3755/19937618160_ea93096572.jpg)

Can buy this unprized precious maid of me

And for night-tapers crop their waxen thighs

That I have done for you

You're welcome gentlemen

That seest a game played home the rich stake drawn

By law of nature and of nations 'longs

![](https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3816/20117611822_dd9edc0ffd.jpg)

Good sooth it showed well in you Do so now

Stretches itself beyond the hour of death

Speak this no more

A priestly farewell to her Suddenly woman

Have you yourselves Somerset Buckingham

Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses

But by immortal providence she's mine

Wert thou the Hector

Then love-devouring death do what he dare

I life would wish and that I might

For he is gracious if he be observed

Sir Nicholas Gawsey hath for succor sent

![](https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3816/19937537948_50fa362527.jpg)

Is in his brain He bites his lip and starts

Shall see this and bless heaven

Something to save thy life

Then certifies your Lordship that this night

No 'tis his kind of speech He did not mock us

Who slew today a riotous gentleman

![](https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3777/20117613922_e986c48f81.jpg)

I know not what but formal in apparel

For them the gracious Duncan have I murdered

Here's Rome's young captain Let him tell the tale

Enter sir the castle

To their lord's murder Roasted in wrath and fire

What mak'st thou me a dullard in this act

![](https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3779/20117614622_ff30a8afb1.jpg)

To answer thy best pleasure Be 't to fly

Rent off thy silver hair thy other hand

'Tis not yet near day Come go with me

With all the virtues that attend the good

Importing health and graveness Two months since

Till you conclude that he upon whose side

![](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/549/19889184542_2c8fe93eae.jpg)

'Tis strange to think how much King John hath lost

And Somerset another goodly mast

The sea with such a storm as his bare head

And finding little comfort to relieve them

The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny

Divide me from your bosom

![](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/457/19896700775_411fbba551.jpg)

Ay you have been a mouse-hunt in your time

And wished in silence that it were not his

Upon my smiles Go get thee from me Cromwell

But who did bid thee join with us

I am the shadow of poor Buckingham

What can you do me greater harm than hate

![](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/498/19870476516_7edc73db5e.jpg)

Go thou toward home where I will never come

O sweet-suggesting Love if thou hast sinned

Let go the hand of that arch-heretic

Even now we heard a hollow burst of bellowing

O my lord my lord

Since mine own doors refuse to entertain me

![](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/328/19275764093_6ccb4955a3.jpg)

For I mine eyes will rivet to his face

Reward did threaten and encourage him

Gertrude do not drink

A lady like me with a love even such

Who's born that day

Which she hath praised him with above compare

![](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/513/19901742501_44a52b08f5.jpg)

As make your bouts more violent to that end

For her poor brother's pardon

What pain it cost what danger Gods

That it will quickly drop My day is dim

More valor in me than my habits show

Ay marry

Thou hast Sebastian done good feature shame

You showed your teeth like apes and fawned like hounds

Good master take it not unkindly pray

O just but severe law

Nor I'll assure you better taken sir

Was ever known so great and little loss

Was not that Hector

The substance of my speech If that rebellion

Of wat'ry Neptune is now bound in with shame

And talk to you sometimes Dwell I but in the suburbs

But boldly stand and front him to his face

Never to hope again

I say she never did invent this letter

Where sits Deformity to mock my body

I serve you madam

I have yielded to Fresh embassies and suits

Most like this dreadful night

And reason panders will

With that sour ferryman which poets write of

Did not deserve corn gratis Being i' th' war

A chough of as deep chat O that you bore

Why then a ladder quaintly made of cords

O that I were a mockery king of snow

Alack for mercy

Master go on and I will follow thee

An if the devil come and roar for them

Women and children of so high a courage

Might in their working do you that offense

All my abilities in thy behalf

As thou art knight never to disobey

![](https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3779/19275765743_a779d9dfa2.jpg)

My sighs and tears and will not once relent

Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are

And there is nothing left remarkable

Love lend me patience to forbear awhile

Why then 'tis hers my lord and being hers

Let me have audience for a word or two

![](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/442/19870478706_af4678700a.jpg)

Must have a word anon Lay hold on him

So by a roaring tempest on the flood

Loves for his own ends not for you

And stand between her back sir and the fire

And commendable proved let's die in pride

The King's attorney on the contrary

Poor bird thou 'dst never fear the net nor lime

Hark hark one knocks Portia go in awhile

O by whom

Should we be silent and not speak our raiment

Is purchase of a heavy curse from Rome

What louring star now envies thy estate

Like hardiment Posthumus hath

Thy brother being carelessly encamped

From every meaner man

You know a sword employed is perilous

![](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/345/19274050894_a607a570ab.jpg)

The curse of heaven and men succeed their evils

Seal up the mouth of outrage for awhile

I would I had your bond For I perceive

O Fate take not away thy heavy hand

The castle royally is manned my lord

What wicked and dissembling glass of mine

![](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/409/19274059904_6419777989.jpg)

Nor bruise her flow'rets with the arm√®d hoofs

The news of thy success and when he reads

My actions are as noble as my thoughts

Than you can put us to 't

Strike up the drum cry Courage and away

From time to time I have acquainted you

Come hither gentlemen

Came on the part of York pressed by his master

I pray you sir go forth

By all the everlasting gods I'll go

Together with the pitiful complaints

Why these balls bound there's noise in it 'Tis hard

Doth add more grief to too much of mine own

I will not leave the half-achieved Harfleur

By the eternal God whose name and power

Plague him with flies Though that his joy be joy

Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke

Where is the County's page that raised the watch

Have cost a mass of public treasury

Tell me Apollo for thy Daphnes love

The smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor

My honor would not let ingratitude

Cool and congeal again to what it was

May trumpet to the world My heart's subdued

I hear some noise Lady come from that nest

This is a strange repose to be asleep

It is not so for how can this be true

They have not been commanded mighty king

To seek out sorrow that dwells everywhere

So now the gates are ope Now prove good seconds

Thou hast made me giddy

As seld I have the chance I would desire

So flewed so sanded and their heads are hung

Whose leisure I have stayed have given him time

Until the Queen his mistress bury it

And made their bends adornings At the helm

![](https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3670/19708684880_891a02f899.jpg)

And my young mistress thus I did bespeak

Nay sure I think she holds them prisoners still

Believe me lords were none more wise than I

Which I hope well is not enroll√®d there

Fell slaughter on their souls Heaven rest them now

Cry Trojans

And thus I set my foot on 's neck even then

To gorge his appetite shall to my bosom

That Falstaff at that oak shall meet with us

By violent swiftness that which we run at

And worthy shameful check it were to stand

That so I harried him Why methinks by him

Where on a sudden one hath wounded me

A charge Lord York that I will see performed

Root of hemlock digged i' th' dark

For mine own part

She had just cause

The arm of mine own body and the heart

A slave without a knock

And cut her hands and trimmed her as thou sawest

And my integrity ne'er knew the crafts

For all the frosty nights that I have watched

Come 'tis no matter

Yourself held precious in the world's esteem

And in some sort these wants of mine are crowned

That we present us to him

Nay stay Thou shouldst be honest

Have we done aught amiss Show us wherein

That e'er I sighed for Pity move my father

Then to cart with Rosalind

To whose ingrate and unauspicious altars

Most worthy gentleman I and my friend

Lest thou be hated both of God and man

To lock such rascal counters from his friends

The orchard walls are high and hard to climb

Let him come in

A strong faith to conceal it

But do not love thyself then thou wilt keep

O would thou wert as thou tofore hast been

A very drudge of nature's have subdued me

The princes orgulous their high blood chafed

Besides he says there are two councils kept

You will not do 't for all the world I hope

It were not for your quiet nor your good

Hearing so much will speed her foot again

Thou never shouldst love woman like to me

And never stir assailants

The acts commenc√®d on this ball of earth

O then dear saint let lips do what hands do

Whom love hath turned almost the wrong side out

Ay madam from the reach of these my hands

That you are now a maid Thus then in brief

Let me thy servant and not sovereign be

I am sick of this false world and will love nought

Good even Casca Brought you Caesar home

Why fare thee well Here is some gold for thee

Make servants of their betters

Flatter and praise commend extol their graces

To help me sort such needful ornaments

To bid me trudge

And let us not be dainty of leave-taking

Would not have touched would not have stained with blood

Although we fancy not the Cardinal

Methought she purged the air of pestilence

And mar the concord with too harsh a descant

In having known no travel in his youth

Who 'twas that cut thy tongue and ravished thee

And then I would no other company

Will cost my crown and like an empty eagle

Or else break out in peevish jealousies

Ay but she'll think that it is spoke in hate

Grace of the Duke revenges to your heart

Fool of thyself speak well Fool do not flatter

Mercy but murders pardoning those that kill

Why now is Henry king and Margaret queen

Ajax renowned O heavens what some men do

When every feather sticks in his own wing

Might come to me again Who's there

Unmerciful lady as you are I'm none

The purple violets and marigolds

Divers and dangerous which are heresies

I am not warm yet Let us fight again

And for our coffers with too great a court

Whether those peals of praise be his or no

For one being sued to one that humbly sues

A fellow almost damned in a fair wife

That triumph thus upon my misery

But yet you see how soon the day o'ercast

I will not stay thy questions Let me go

Dismiss my soldiers or capitulate

O sland'rous world Kate like the hazel twig

The thin and wholesome blood So did it mine

You are contented to be led in triumph

If I lose them thus find I by their loss

In weeping after this untimely bier

As makes the angels weep who with our spleens

Now sir the sound that tells what hour it is

Have just our theme of woe But for the miracle

Because so well I love Lucentio

Do as the carrion does not as the flower

You gracious couple do And then I lost

Than customary bounty can enforce you

Ay that incestuous that adulterate beast

What are they that fly there

And more than may be gathered by thy shape

To curb those raging appetites that are

Striving to make an ugly deed look fair

Then rose again and bowed her to the people

Villains answer you so the Lord Protector

Choked the respect of likely peril feared

His discontents are unremovably

Unstaid and skittish in all motions else

Brewed with her sorrow mashed upon her cheeks

And that she hath all courtly parts more exquisite

How that the guilty kindred of the Queen

Upon the north side of this pleasant chase

With best advantage will deceive the time

For with throwing thus my head

Bid them all home He's gone and we'll no further

Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean

For hands to do Rome service is but vain

Here you shall see a countryman of yours

As I learned

Force should be right or rather right and wrong

O Lord I cannot speak to him for weeping

Be thou ashamed that I have took upon me

You know me do you not

If she be mated with an equal husband

A virtuous gentlewoman mild and beautiful

Which as he breathed defiance to my ears

And all our yesterdays have lighted fools

Interpretation should abuse and call this

A sword unbated and in a pass of practice

That nothing but himself which looks like man

Sits smiling to my heart in grace whereof

Do you intend it

As his own state and ours 'tis to be chid

No my noble lord

Let's purge this choler without letting blood

But do not break your oaths for of that sin

In breaking faith with Julia whom I loved

I have o'ershot myself to tell you of it

How now good Cassio what's the news with you

The Duke's in council and your noble self

Well demanded wench

Soldiers this day have you redeemed your lives

Having bought love with such a bloody spoil

Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk

Or raise myself but keep my wonted calling

Once more I'll mark how love can vary wit

Ride thou unto the horsemen on yond hill

Why droops my lord like over-ripened corn

![](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/555/19268664062_b183a142d8.jpg)

What wilt thou flout me thus unto my face

Leave this faint puling and lament as I do

Though now this grain√®d face of mine be hid

You clasp young Cupid's tables Good news gods

But I return his sworn and mortal foe

So like a waking To me comes a creature

Not scurvy nor a temporary meddler

Hear me a word

Whom I affect but she is nice and coy

But with all brief and plain conveniency

And at my suit sweet pardon what is past

Who then dares to be half so kind again

Personates thee and thy lopped branches point

So do you too where you perceive them thick

Father the Duke hath told the truth

And would not take their part Sinful Macduff

On that which breeds between 'em

A miracle a miracle

And I had rather glib myself than they

But that of coward hares hot goats and venison

Such men my friends than enemies Go on

Of civil wounds plowed up with neighbor's sword

No not a grize for 'tis a vulgar proof

Must I go like a traitor thither

And harsh in sound to thine

Upon this overweening traitor's foot

As little as a crow or less ere left

When through proud London he came sighing on

But that the dread of something after death

Was there with him if I have heard a truth

Know that tomorrow the last of many battles

'Tis sweet at first t' acquire after this process

And swear with me as with the woeful fere

How chance the King comes with so small a number

Which way to be prevented if to be

Between the pale complexion of true love

As is the osprey to the fish who takes it

Therefore I urge thy oath for that I know

But if thou be a king where is thy crown

You shall perceive them make a mutual stand

One must prove greatest While they weigh so even

So shalt thou show me friendship Take thou that

Why Jessica I say

Where is your husband

Being sick have in some measure made me well

I long till Edward fall by war's mischance

Ere you come there be sure to hear some news

We charge you in God's name and the King's

Upon my death the French can little boast

That like a rude and savage man of Ind

It is reported mighty sovereign

Upon the heath

With modest warrant

Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes

My people did expect my hence departure

I thought King Henry had resembled thee

Their very noses had been counselors

But that I'll give my voice on Richard's side

And what God will that let your king perform

Hortensio will be quit with thee by changing

This scattered corn into one mutual sheaf

Where

And so did I

Is to make midnight mushrumps that rejoice

Or pay you with unthankfulness in thought

For I upon this bank will rest my head

Home to your cottages forsake this groom

His goods confiscate to the Duke's dispose

That lived that loved that liked that looked with cheer

Take thy fair hour Laertes Time be thine

She would be as swift in motion as a ball

I would prevail if prayers might prevail

But see where Somerset and Clarence comes

Doth the news hold of good King Edward's death

My love my life my soul fair Helena

My breast can better brook thy dagger's point

Andronicus himself did take it up

And thou unfit for any place but hell

Shall starlike rise as great in fame as she was

New-bent in heaven shall behold the night

Like Caesar's sister The wife of Antony

As we'll direct her how 'tis best to bear it

It is war's prize to take all vantages

If put upon you make the judgment good

Making them proud of his humility

It will be light my lord that you may bear it

Than this which to reiterate were sin

Why didst thou say of late thou wert despised

The which immediacy may well stand up

False-boding woman end thy frantic curse

Knavery's plain face is never seen till used

That going shall be used with feet

Conceit more rich in matter than in words

O dear account My life is my foe's debt

When he shall come to his account he knows not

Stand forth Demetrius My noble lord

Good my lord be cured

And by his rare example made the coward

And you the Empress But we worldly men

What's thy passion

And rank me with the barbarous multitudes

The difference of old Shylock and Bassanio

That e'er I heard Shall I produce the men

Therefore to arms And father do but think

And like a dog that is compelled to fight

Like to the Garter's compass in a ring

Do make their children blind

Two mighty eagles fell and there they perched

Where thrift may follow fawning Dost thou hear

The fairest I have yet beheld desires access

A guard of patience Stay a little while

And nothing more may fitly like your Grace

Hold you still I say

I cheered them up with justice of our cause

Our former hatred so thrive I and mine

Shall I be tempted to infringe my vow

In the day's glorious walk or peaceful night

She weeps and says her Henry is deposed

Come

As index to the story we late talked of

To be new varnished Well but to my choice

We are the Queen's abjects and must obey

That tide will stay me longer than I should

You have a thing for me It is a common thing

With that she sigh√®d as she stood

How goes the world sir now

My mistress loved thee and her fortunes mingled

To th' discontented members the mutinous parts

When thousands weep more than did laugh at it

Which followed well would demonstrate them now

Told me the King provoked to it by the Queen

And 'tis no marvel he is so humorous

To call for recompense Appear it to your mind

Is not that he that lies upon the ground

When they are gone then must I count my gains

Diseases in our bodies I must perforce

So minutes hours days months and years

![](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7741/18356300455_e0754eaf70.jpg)

Her life was beastly and devoid of pity

As friendship wears at feasts keep with Bohemia

She hath been colted by him

Of this his nephew's purpose to suppress

And at my lovely Tamora's entreats

Unless you call it good to pity him

Which are not sterling Tender yourself more dearly

If Duke of Burgundy you would the peace

May hold together On her frights and griefs

When neither are alive

That shall maintain what I have said is true

She hath pursued conclusions infinite

Is Paris lost Is Roan yielded up

Didst rob it of some taste of tediousness

And on all sides th' authority allowed

To more approv√®d service and desert

In bed asleep while they do dream things true

And therefore bind them gentle Publius

Of such a nature is his politic love

No I will sit and watch here by the King

I do remember an apothecary

Which with usurping steps do trample thee

And now declare sweet stem from York's great stock

Lavinia live outlive thy father's days

Which oft the ear of greatness needs must hear

And boarded her i' th' wanton way of youth

Fetch us in fuel and be quick thou 'rt best

O most false love

Had you been as wise as bold

How the dispatch is made and in what fashion

And carriage of the article designed

As glorious to this night being o'er my head

That one by one pursue If you give way

Speak for yourselves My wit is at an end

To whom I will retail my conquest won

Post back with speed and tell him what hath chanced

I will not resalute the streets of Rome

Pleading for a lover's fee

And ere thou bid good night to quite their griefs

'Tis threefold too little for carrying a letter to your lover

Set on your foot

So you shall

Yet who so bold but says he sees it not

If he had gone forth consul found it so

Whether in sea or fire in earth or air

Sorrow so royally in you appears

How blow How blow Speak to be understood

That they did wake each other I stood and heard them

That you have slandered so

And he shall spend mine honor with his shame

I have too much believed mine own suspicion

I fear no uncles dead

And let him cry Ha louder

Must be their schoolmasters Shut up your doors

Peace lady Pause or be more temperate

Ill spirit I would hold more talk with thee

Its tenderness and make itself a pastime

This is too heavy Let me see another

As you have ever been my father's honored friend

And with his arms outstretched as he would fly

Nor is your firm resolve unknown to me

A second time I kill my husband dead

I'll follow sir But first an 't please the gods

What more

Now thy proud neck bears half my burdened yoke

My fault being nothing as I have told you oft

Leaps to be gone into my mother's bosom

Took it in snuff and still he smiled and talked

Some time I shall sleep out the rest I'll whistle

Endured of her for whom you bid like sorrow

Therefore no more but this Henry your sovereign

I am afraid my daughter will run mad

Nod to him elves and do him courtesies

And for those wrongs those bitter injuries

A backfriend a shoulder clapper one that countermands

To revel in the entrails of my lambs

And I who at his hands received my life

This is my treasurer Let him speak my lord

Outlive thy glory like my wretched self

Withhold thy speed dreadful occasion

And follow Martius

O yes into a thousand similes

Is Lewis so brave Belike he thinks me Henry

They called us for our fierceness English dogs

They willfully themselves exile from light

If sanctimony be the gods' delight

And do 't the speedier that you may direct me

It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain

And stick them in our will Sixth part of each

Now the number is even

Tush women have been captivate ere now

Please you retire to your chamber

And think to wed it he is so above me

For when I am revenged upon my charm

'Tis good sir you are very short with us

Fie wrangling queen

Thy promises are like Adonis' garden

Would ever with Marina be

Come I have learned that fearful commenting

What say you Will you yield and this avoid

What should the people do with these bald tribunes

Wiped the black scruples reconciled my thoughts

You must not dare for shame to talk of mercy

Tell me not friar that thou hearest of this

Here is my hand for my true constancy

Give me your hand Come you from old Bellario

For suddenly a grievous sickness took him

By uproars severed as a flight of fowl

Valor and pride excel themselves in Hector

And leave you to your graver steps Hermione

Being the time the potion's force should cease

That thou wert cause of noble Gloucester's death

Who put unluckily into this bay

And make thee rich for doing me such wrong

No trumpet answers

Clarence is come false fleeting perjured Clarence

I have spoke this to know if your affiance

With my base tongue give to my noble heart

To make the coming hour o'erflow with joy

You wagered on your angling when your diver

I should do so in honor I am in this

You should have feared false times when you did feast

Their crownets regal from th' Athenian bay

It was villain ere thy hand did set it down

Where is my lady

More wonderful when angels are so angry

Blush for pure shame to counterfeit our roses

How blest are we that are not simple men

I am not merry but I do beguile

O you immortal gods I will not go

Have I been ever free and must my house

Do I take part The rarer action is

Thus smiling as some fly had tickled slumber

![](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8820/17086716147_9cf9361f67.jpg)

Out of the pain you suffered gave no ear to 't

Why all these fires why all these gliding ghosts

My liege one word

Much more than death Do not say banishment

Were all the wealth I have shut up in thee

My Icarus my blossom in his pride

That starts i' th' way before thee

Alas poor lady

No If I mistake

Scarce serves to quench my furnace-burning heart

Give me Bianca for my patrimony

And graves have yawned and yielded up their dead

Well then no more but this go gentle Catesby

All things are ready if our minds be so

It makes us or it mars us think on that

Killing care and grief of heart

If you be maid or no

When blood is nipped and ways be foul

And I'll devise a mean to draw the Moor

Do so and let no man abide this deed

May rather pluck on laughter than revenge

Why not on Proteus as of all the rest

Saw you no more Marked you not how her sister

That gives not half so great a blow to hear

Why this Volumnius

'Tween snow and fire as treason and my love

Even so quickly may one catch the plague

My stay my guide and lantern to my feet

I never saw but Humphrey Duke of Gloucester

Zounds I was never so bethumped with words

With all his crimes broad blown as flush as May

Hang up your ensigns let your drums be still

Out-sweetened not thy breath The ruddock would

Not sorting with a nuptial ceremony

As my sweet Richard Yet again methinks

And call upon my soul within the house

![](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7677/17106615620_66eb983f35.jpg)

By any voice or order of the field

Like little body with a mighty heart

Perchance he will not mind me

And danger like an ague subtly taints

Faint-hearted boy arise and look upon her

As I am son and servant to your will

![](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8719/16673916653_d926a94fc0.jpg)

And mark how well the sequel hangs together

I hope well of tomorrow and will lead you

With aptness of the season Make denials

Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife

Here will we sit and let the sounds of music

This shower blown up by tempest of the soul

He is much changed

On Fortinbras which he in brief obeys

Got 'tween asleep and wake Well then

That liberal shepherds give a grosser name

There's such divinity doth hedge a king

But my daughter

He is no less than what we say he is

Women help heaven men their creation mar

And there's an oath of credit

Lordings farewell and say when I am gone

Hath won the greatest favor of the Commons

You fools I and my fellows

But go at once

Ordained our laws whose use the sword of Caesar

The Prince of Cumberland That is a step

And power i' th' truth o' th' cause

He something seems unsettled

I do embrace thee as I would embrace

She knows the heat of a luxurious bed

Lest you mistake The heavens are over our heads

Ay no no ay for I must nothing be

'Tis not so dear yet 'tis a life you coined it

Even with a treacherous fine of all your lives

And torture him with grievous ling'ring death

His hours filled up with riots banquets sports

A little proudly and great deal misprizing

Your mother lives a witness to his vow

I'll humbly signify what in his name

That lived that loved that liked that looked with cheer

Forget forgive conclude and be agreed

Now fair befall thee good Petruchio

But marked him not a word O he is as tedious

I see as in a map the end of all

Thou wouldst as soon go kindle fire with snow

A one my daughter might have been my queen's

The pig quoth I is burned My gold quoth he

And natural graces that extinguish art

His rage can do on me You must be gone

Much is your sorrow mine ten times so much

With any scruple Your scope is as mine own

As long as heaven and nature lengthens it

I will my lord

Full fathom five thy father lies

Appear thus to us

When think you that the sword goes up again

Give him deserved vexation Let a guard

What you as from your father shall deliver

Other conclusions I will try the forces

I shall serve you sir

To thrust the lie unto him

There's reason he should be displeased at it

Striking too short at Greeks His antique sword

All my reports go with the modest truth

The great prerogative and rite of love

Where serpents are Chain me with roaring bears

Slow in pursuit but matched in mouth like bells

I feel my master's passion This slave

What's dumb in show I'll plain with speech

Coal-black is better than another hue

A heavy sight

That by no means I may discover them

For God's sake lords give signal to the fight

Keep my need up and faith is trodden down

I know him well He is the brooch indeed

An eye like Mars' to threaten and command

I pardon him as God shall pardon me

Why should a dog a horse a rat have life

O bless√®d bond of board and bed

At Saint Gregory's well

Immediately to marry She hath consented Now sir

But who is with him

To angle for your thoughts But you are wise

But small to greater matters must give way

The wheel is come full circle I am here

On courtiers' knees that dream on cur'sies straight

I shall return before your Lordship thence

That Brutus leads me on

Who has a book of all that monarchs do

Expect even here where is a kingly patient

To save my boy to nourish and bring him up

I tell thee Kate 'twas burnt and dried away

If judgment lie in them then so do we

Even to the guilt or the purgation

Which was thrust forth of Milan who most strangely

Is not his brother Thomas of Clarence with him

Above the rest begone

We do salute you Duke of Burgundy

For quiet days fair issue and long life

The providence that's in a watchful state

Where rude misgoverned hands from windows' tops

When that the general is not like the hive

Leaving their earthly parts to choke your clime

Grief-shot with his unkindness Say 't be so

With any longed-for change or better state

The last is for my men they are the poorest

Upon a parchment and against this fire

In my penurious band I have heard and grieved

With such a smooth discreet and stable bearing

My youngest boy and yet my eldest care

And may not be perform√®d by thyself

Of regular justice in your city's bounds

E'en to the Hall to hear what shall become

A moderate table

Forbear sharp speeches to her She's a lady

When honor's at the stake How stand I then

Gentle son Edward thou wilt stay with me

As painfully to pore upon a book

And drowned

There's not so much left to furnish out

The night to th' owl and morn to th' lark less welcome

Nettled and stung with pismires when I hear

Stands without blemish next it imports no reason

And so from hour to hour we ripe and ripe

Till I find more than will or words to do it

Masters know you that

It would make a man mad as a buck to be so bought and sold

And when you are desirous to be blest

Have now the fatal object in my eye

Changes the mood for what in me was purchased

To see you so attired swoon I think

O this same thought did but forerun my need

For England

I'll to the mart and there for Dromio stay

Than is the doting title of a mother

Of my lord's tricks and yours when you were boys

If not already

I am your butt and I abide your shot

In those freckles live their savors

I that I am one now

But as a thing of custom 'Tis no other

And all my powers do their bestowing lose

Thou that threw'st dust upon his goodly head

To prove whose blood is reddest his or mine

Have brought ourselves into a burning fever

I killed the slave that was a-hanging thee

Thou and thy meaner fellows your last service

Why I am glad on 't This is well Stand up

That makes thee stare thus Wherefore breaks that sigh

Before the King will grant her humble suit

To conquer France his true inheritance

My lord I cannot be so soon provided

And but one meal on every day besides

That they devour their reason and scarce think

But what said Lady Bona to my marriage

Indifferent

And in record left them the heirs of shame

She hung about my neck and kiss on kiss

![](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8702/17257125015_f5e54e8149.jpg)

Alas how then

And that a wing√®d Mercury did bear

Be lion-mettled proud and take no care

O cunning enemy that to catch a saint

But in the estimation of a hair

That not another comfort like to this

Lo yonder and Titinius mourning it

O fear me not

Strike not by land keep whole Provoke not battle

But it sufficeth that the day will end

Live like Diana's priest betwixt cold sheets

When Caesar's wife shall meet with better dreams

To a dear friend of the good Duke of York's

The one by th' other

The good I stand on is my truth and honesty

He gave you all the duties of a man

But thou shouldst please me better wouldst thou weep

Ask nothing give it him it foals me straight

Against the Moor For I do know the state

Expresseth his full tilth and husbandry

Be used more thankfully In himself 'tis much

Yes as sparrows eagles or the hare the lion

Come enter with us Ladies you deserve

He that sweetest rose will find

Though all these English and their discipline

I was unhandsome warrior as I am

To load my she with knacks I would have ransacked

And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain

Than of his outward show which God He knows

Pray you go fit you to the custom and

![](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7698/17061234458_f07d55d8e8.jpg)

And shrewd and froward so beyond all measure

Sure these are but imaginary wiles

A vengeance on your crafty withered hide

O my poor brother And so perchance may he be

Than doth a rich embroidered canopy

Grasps in the comer Welcome ever smiles

Have followed both my fortunes faithfully

Must be supplyant The words of your commission

Desire them all to my pavilion

And Aesculapius guide us

Digressing from the valor of a man

As did the fatal brand Althaea burnt

Digest it with a custom I should blush

And what's the news good cousin Lodovico

You shall not stir out of your house today

Knight knight good mother Basilisco-like

Faith no he comes too late

Till his deserts are past begin to throw

And let her head fall into England's lap

The best way is to venge my Gloucester's death

Let me give light but let me not be light

And every hour more competitors

Save you good madam

Borne with th' invisible and creeping wind

Was once superfluous You were crowned before

And his soft couch defile

Seem to see the things thou dost not Now now now now

That quicken even with blowing O thou weed

I will do 't my lord

In like conditions as our argument

May enter 'twixt the gap of both and take

My duty to you both on equal love

This gallant pins the wenches on his sleeve

Yet Nature might have made me as these are

Your Honor's players hearing your amendment

Nor to betray you any way to sorrow

Ah whither shall I fly to scape their hands

Confined to exhibition All this done

Why are you sequestered from all your train

Now go thy ways thou hast tamed a curst shrow

Durst thou have looked upon him being awake

To the King's danger Presently the Duke

I am thy friend and pity thee dear Timon

Shall stop or spur me Have I done well

Obey it on all cause

But what's the matter

Of crowflowers nettles daisies and long purples

Madam speak true It is not so my lord

Labeo and Flavius set our battles on

And let not search and inquisition quail

We met here both to thank and to remember

What comfort man How is 't with ag√®d Gaunt

I will but spend a word here in the house

Or thrive by other means

Be shook to air

You have often

And would not force the letter to my view

Thou counterfeits a bark a sea a wind

But madam I must trouble you again

O Lady Fortune

Here's one comes in his shirt with light and weapons

One that hath ever been God's enemy

Troy must not be nor goodly Ilium stand

Some devil whisper curses in my ear

These English woes shall make me smile in France

If you have any justice any pity

It is the witness still of excellency

If I achieve not this young modest girl

While I go to the goldsmith's house go thou

When thou wert regent for our sovereign

Receiving them from such a worthless post

To bloody thoughts and to revenge I chose

The Moor's abused by some most villainous knave

Trust not to rotten planks Do you misdoubt

This valley fits the purpose passing well

Lest zeal now melted by the windy breath

That ride upon the violent speed of fire

A poor unlearn√®d virgin when the schools

And if thou fail us all our hope is done

A marriage 'twixt the Duke of Orleans and

Which being shallow you shall give me leave

Ungoverned youth to wail it in their age

Steeped me in poverty to the very lips

Being now awake I'll queen it no inch farther

Ay Hamlet

Never did faithful subject more rejoice

My lord good morrow Good morrow Catesby

And till thou be restored thou art a yeoman

No no the drink the drink O my dear Hamlet

For thee O Imogen even for whom my life

These likelihoods confirm her flight from hence

Unwieldy slow heavy and pale as lead

Now these her princes are come home again

Unto the traject to the common ferry

To have saved their carcasses took heel to do 't

What dost thou mean by shaking of thy head

That might have known my place I see no sense for 't

Till hasty Polydor return and bring him

But I shall lose the grounds I work upon

And in my vambrace put my withered brawns

Who is so full of grace that it flows over

For it is you that puts us to our shifts

Rise prithee rise

And wish for her sake more than for mine own

God for His mercy what a tide of woes

And give 't Iago What he will do with it

Wilt thou O God fly from such gentle lambs

And by and by I will to thee appear

Post back with speed and tell him what hath chanced

And feeds from home Poor I am but his stale

At your noble pleasure

For I myself at this time have employed him

Such as seafaring men provide for storms

Why bear you these rebukes and answer not

Amen

Your trusty and most valiant servitor

For I must ever doubt though ne'er so sure

The more you beat me I will fawn on you

Would seem but modest Therefore I beseech you

Taking the measure of an unmade grave

And there repose A turn or two I'll walk

My heart hath one poor string to stay it by

And so we'll leave you to your meditations

Out three years old

And bid her wipe her weeping eyes withal

If you respect them best to take them up

When we have marked with blood those sleepy two

Whose beauty did astonish the survey

Under a cloak that is of any length

If that the soldier strike him as I judge

In that there's comfort

To give it due content

Which I so often owe but your ring first

With turbulent and dangerous lunacy

The fruits of love I mean my loving liege

You never shall so help you truth and God

Were but the outside of the Roman Brutus

Even as her appetite shall play the god

For he is set so only to himself

Sole monarch of the universal Earth

Who's gone this morning

![](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7710/16962152568_b7dcfb9795.jpg)

Shall never see so much nor live so long

Tune a deploring dump the night's dead silence

Turn all to serpents Call the slave again

The man is honest

Urge neither charity nor shame to me

For when no friends are by men praise themselves

![](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8800/17149300581_76f89a27c7.jpg)

And many an orphan's water-standing eye

Thy virtues spoke of and thy beauty sounded

Why then young Bertram take her She's thy wife

Being strumpeted by thy contagion

Because you are not sad Now by two-headed Janus

Fly o'er them all impatient for their hour

![](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7692/16962398550_9accc2628e.jpg)

The other turns to a mirth-moving jest

Can chase away the first-conceiv√®d sound

He is prepared and reason too he should

For let our finger ache and it endues

And so of these which is the natural man

But let it rest Now Litio to you

Tend'ring the precious safety of my prince

Leaving free things and happy shows behind

I would not be the villain that thou think'st

We'll hear him Noble Antony go up

The tongues o' th' common mouth I do despise them

The man I do assure you is not here

![](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8755/17149934085_92cfeffaea.jpg)

Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead

And make a checkered shadow on the ground

He words me girls he words me that I should not

Do not smile at me that I boast of her

I shall be satisfied

Yet ask

Here's such a coil Come what says Romeo

Madam I was

This expedition was by York and Talbot

If you went in pain master this knave would go sore

Sad stories chanc√®d in the times of old

O heavens themselves

![](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7668/16962153088_a79f55e59e.jpg)

In this hot trial more than we of France

And on your family's old monument

The thunder of my cannon shall be heard

Envenoms him that bears it

That mothers shall but smile when they behold

The time is worth the use on 't

And do not know ourselves when we hold rumor

I am as woeful as Virginius was

It is not his my lord here Southam lies

Either now or by remissness new-conceived

His language in his tears

Where's his examination

![](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7620/17123976296_7a82e61e70.jpg)

He threw his wounded arm and kissed his lips

Hold sir for God's sake Now your jest is earnest

Or I whate'er it be

'Tis not alone my inky cloak good mother

And humble service till the point of death

He did bespeak a chain for me but had it not

A sweet reversion We may boldly spend

How does my old acquaintance of this isle

Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither

Confine yourself but in a patient list

I am not I if there be such an I

The noble Westmoreland and warlike Blunt

Your voices therefore When we granted that

I am a very foolish fond old man

Sacred and sweet was all I saw in her

As 'twere in scorn of eyes reflecting gems

All sanctimonious ceremonies may

But now thou seem'st a coward

Under the sweet shade of your government

That is the best news That the Earl of Richmond

May counterpoise this rich and precious gift

In poison there is physic and these news

The monstrous bulk of this ingratitude

I'll turn my part thereof into thy throat

A gracious king that pardons all offenses

To murder me

Whiles thus you mock it how in stripping it

Unto his son Lorenzo and his daughter

No funeral rite nor man in mourning weed

May we not see him

Ay where thou dar'st not peep An if thou dar'st

Witness the tiring day and heavy night

Lives sir

To be the father unto many sons

So please you save the thanks this prince expects

Before the wheels of Phoebus round about

These unknown friends to 's welcome for it is

As true as truest horse that yet would never tire

What art thou

We breathed our counsel but it pleased your Highness

The morning's danger and their gesture sad

The King by this is set him down to sleep

Proceed proceed We'll begin these rites

A royal knavery an exact command

What sights my lord

Than to be us√®d as you use your dog

Thou naughty jailer that thou art so fond

That sways the earth this climate overlooks

About his neck Bohemia who if I

It lies to cure me and the cure is to

That shall remain a poison where it is

And let his manly face which promiseth

To look like her are chimney-sweepers black

I will tell no tales

Excite the mortified man

Change not your offer made in heat of blood

To Katherine For shame thou hilding of a devilish spirit

Where folly now possesses Do thou work

To th' winds whose pity sighing back again

Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change

Green earthen pots bladders and musty seeds

In wholesome manner

Happiest of all is that her gentle spirit

Of noisome musty chaff He said 'twas folly

But who comes in such haste in riding robes

More than light airs and recollected terms

Cry No recovery

Thinking this voice an arm√®d Englishman

Whose inward pinches therefore are most strong

First he denied you had in him no right

Cousin of Buckingham a word with you

'Tis too much proved that with devotion's visage

She hath but one for herself to desire that were a shame

To come and sport Her peacocks fly amain

Peace both and hear me speak

So let it be with Caesar The noble Brutus

Whose pitchy mantle over-veiled the Earth

Than ever you or yours by me were harmed

Son to the elder brother of this man

Like a right gypsy hath at fast and loose

Why hast thou slain thine only daughter thus

How will she love when the rich golden shaft

O let me stay

In your fair minds let this acceptance take

At Fortune's alms You have obedience scanted

So doth the coney struggle in the net

When adverse foreigners affright my towns

Whose price hath launched above a thousand ships

I'll yet follow

A greater crack The round world

Why stay we then

Who will of thy arrival be full joyous

To seek her on the mountains near to Milford

Longer for him to make his rest

That the poor soldier that so richly fought

The crows and choughs that wing the midway air

Of bloody turbulence and this whole night

Thrown upon this shore I oped the coffin

For the sea's worth But look what lights come yond

This palpable-gross play hath well beguiled

And he long traded in it makes it seem

He'll make a proper man The best thing in him

Without the stamp of merit Let none presume

Yield up his life unto a world of odds

You see this fellow that is gone before

Come blade my breast imbrue Thisbe stabs herself

To oppose his hatred fully Welcome home

I prithee do not hold me to mine oath

Wherewith already France is overrun

Romans of five-and-twenty valiant sons

And so we'll leave you to your meditations

I am an officer of state and come

The multitudinous tongue let them not lick

I give my daughter to him and will make

What's to come is still unsure

Burn like the mines of sulfur

And many Jasons come in quest of her

Not I My thoughts aim at a further matter

And more more strong when lesser is my fear

And bowed her hand to teach her fingering

And even here brake off and came away

Which his aspiring rider seemed to know

This after me I have writ my name

If it be found so some will dear abide it

Farewell my cousin Farewell gentle friends

When I was mortal my anointed body

That you have slandered so

Now shall my friend Petruchio do me grace

And tell false Edward thy suppos√®d king

Who chants a doleful hymn to his own death

And yet died too I in mine own woe charmed

And fitter is my study and my books

Well praised How if she be black and witty

As cannons overcharged with double cracks

I beseech your Graces both to pardon me

Of homage and I know not how much tribute

No excuse current but to hang thyself

Where never man's eye may behold my body

The Mayor towards Guildhall hies him in all post

Matter against me and his eye reviled

If we be conquered let men conquer us

Or but a sickly part of one true sense

That we are those which chased you from the field

And then my soul shall wait on thee to heaven

Unshaked of motion and that I am he

But that's no welcome Understand more clear

So in his red blood Cassius' day is set

Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart

The contrary doth make thee wondered at

And in my voice most welcome shall you be

And therefore thou mayst think my havior light

But his neat cookery He cut our roots in characters

Ah would the scandal vanish with my life

And if their wisdoms be misled in this

Without a heart to dare or sword to draw

Whiles others fish with craft for great opinion

They that of late were daring with their scoffs

And try your penitence if it be sound

Cousin away for England Haste before

You'll give me leave to spare when you shall find

But you say she's honest

The Duke is entering Therefore hence away

Half your suit

A pound of flesh to be by him cut off

Through all the kingdoms that acknowledge Christ

And worse than Procne I will be revenged

Shall make it live again Woo't thou fight well

Which did subdue the greatest part of Spain

What do you tremble Are you all afraid

And started when he looked upon the Tower

Thou being a king blest with a goodly son

Nay Eleanor then must I chide outright

Defy them then or else hold close thy lips

Whose glorious deeds but in these fields of late

With whom an upright zeal to right prevails

Yet will I favor thee in what I can

To bring him here alone Although perhaps

His fault is much and the good king his master

And see the noble ruined man you speak of

Why do you put these sayings upon me

Shipwracked upon a kingdom where no pity

Good night to everyone To Brabantio And noble signior

In fearful sense

Lament nor sorrow at but please your thoughts

Hast prisoner held fettered in amorous chains

To anyone nor taken sustenance

Th' inaudible and noiseless foot of time

My soul should sue as advocate for thee

No sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall

Die when you will a smock shall be your shroud

After the hideous storm that followed was

Your presence makes us rich most noble lord

Do so conjointly meet let not men say

I fear the story of his anger

With wing√®d heels as English Mercurys

But jealous souls will not be answered so

Ride on the pants triumphing

There take the crown and with the crown my curse

He needs not our mistrust since he delivers

Or if you'd ask remember this before

We must talk in secret Nurse come back again

In England and in Ireland not confessing

Which would be great impeachment to his age

Or more than any living man could bear

You have known him long and be you well assured

Will ever after droop Here cease more questions

I'll prove a tyrant to him As for you

A night is but small breath and little pause

I conjure you by that which you profess

O brother with the dismal'st object hurt

But who ah woe had seen the mobl√®d queen

The King by me requests your presence straight

As that vast shore washed with the farthest sea

And now he feasts mousing the flesh of men

But all are banished till their conversations

Are many simples operative whose power

Were he as famous and as bold in war

Here lurks no treason here no envy swells

Marry I will and this is wisely done

But hateful docks rough thistles kecksies burrs

Soldiers not thieves

These hairs which thou dost ravish from my chin

And plodded like a man for working days

How swift his ship

What need the bridge much broader than the flood

![](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8771/16953180879_912c7cba69.jpg)

As if he had but proved an argument

That so his sickness age and impotence

On her ingrateful top Strike her young bones

Who grieves much for your weakness and by me

The gods requite his charity

Which by th' interpretation of full time

What my young master O my gentle master

As wild geese that the creeping fowler eye

I'll give thee ere I leave thee so much money

When you have vowed you must not speak with men

A wandering vagabond my rights and royalties

That ever lived

![](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7616/16953181169_60a1892569.jpg)

Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature

His excellence did earn it ere he had it

With surety stronger than Achilles' arm

Where is this viper

Strike those that make them and their story is

Think not although in writing I preferred

The truth is then most done not doing it

Which the most precious square of sense possesses

For I was spoke to with Sir Henry Guilford

As being thought to contradict your liking

Subdue my worthiest self The witch shall die

And twenty cag√®d nightingales do sing

Well madam we must take a short farewell

A dagger of the mind a false creation

Sir Richard Ketly Davy Gam esquire

For being green there is great hope of help

Those that have known the Earth so full of faults

Whom the blind waves and surges have devoured

To Tranio What have I choked you with an argosy

Through Alexandria make a jolly march

I had been mercenary

Think you I can a resolution fetch

Now good my lord lie here and rest awhile

Command me any service to her thither

Buys herself bread and clothes It is a creature

The manner of thy vile outrageous crimes

Puff in thy teeth most recreant coward base

And for an entrance to my entertainment

As I have done the rest of my misleaders

That I might rail at him to ease my mind

To the great lord

O grim-looked night O night with hue so black

She swoons to see them bleed

That indirectly and directly too

Not that I love you not

For shame be friends and join for that you jar

Shall hoodwink this mischance Therefore speak softly

Derives from heaven his quarrel and his cause

I would my father looked but with my eyes

Banished this frail sepulcher of our flesh

I muse my mother

I fear the story of his anger

When thou wak'st if she be by

Draw them to Tiber banks and weep your tears

Stab them or tear them on thy chariot wheels

And sword and shield

Duke of Alanson this was your default

Before his sister should her body stoop

Environed me and howl√®d in mine ears

How able such a work to undergo

That man might ne'er be wretched for his mind

I scorn you not It seems that you scorn me

Worthy to be a rebel for to that

My salad days

But I'll deceive you in another sort

Stand forth Lysander And my gracious duke

And God forgive them that so much have swayed

Let me be cruel not unnatural

For kissing of their feet yet always bending

This gentleman the Prince's near ally

This rest might yet have balmed thy broken sinews

Apollo pardon

Why dost thou call them knaves Thou know'st them not

And let him feed

So up and down the poor ship drives

Poor Tom shall lead thee

Or so much as it needs

Thou seest the heavens as troubled with man's act

If half thy outward graces had been placed

To whose flint bosom my condemn√®d lord

Rome will despise her for this foul escape

Retorts to chiding Fortune

A care-crazed mother to a many sons

Though the seas threaten they are merciful

Thine eyes sweet lady have infected mine

Going to chapel and the voice is now

Here at the palace will I rest awhile

Nor fortune made such havoc of my means

Room ho Tell Antony Brutus is ta'en

Most power to do most harm least knowing ill

More learn√®d than the ears waving thy head

Look how he makes to Caesar Mark him

Nay I'll to him again in name of Brook

With my vexed spirits I cannot take a truce

As I had made my meal and parted

![](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8730/17113427006_6d03e71f47.jpg)

That hand which had the strength even at your door

Why what a madcap hath heaven lent us here

Whose whisper o'er the world's diameter

Trebles thee o'er

Richly in both if justice had her right

To gripe the general sway into your hand

![](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8822/16931964627_45764552e4.jpg)

Whose men and dames so jetted and adorned

God shall be truly known and those about her

That bears the name of life Yet in this life

I like them all and do allow them well

I will my Hermia

These quarrels must be quietly debated

Good night my noble lord

Was called Belarius

Who is 't that calls It is my lady mother

Gentle breath of yours my sails

Dangers doubts wringing of the conscience

The very virtue of compassion in thee

In very ample virtue of his father

Or I attach you by this officer

Shall be struck off Hector what say you to 't

Belief of it oppresses me already

I know his eye doth homage otherwhere

Brother of England you blaspheme in this

She shall not need we'll meet her in the field

The jury passing on the prisoner's life

The greatest strength and power that he can make

But that he was bound by a solemn oath

Or hide your heads like cowards and fly hence

But lest you should not understand me well

![](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7673/16951259608_daa55319a1.jpg)

For I come hither armed against myself

As I have made you one lords one remain

What is the old king dead

Where is my page Go villain fetch a surgeon

All ports I'll bar The villain shall not 'scape

Which if they have as I will leave 'em them

No more my king for he dishonors me

Your daughter if you have not given her leave

The rites for why I love him are bereft me

Let them go on

Because the law hath ta'en revenge on them

Shall love in building grow so ruinous

Infected be the air whereon they ride

To be afeard to tell graybeards the truth

I thank my liege that in regard of me

And yet I know not how conceit may rob

O let us hence I stand on sudden haste

At eighteen years became inquisitive

Good morrow and God save your Majesty

To think that you have aught but Talbot's shadow

What Venus did with Mars

Things won are done joy's soul lies in the doing

Is not my sorrow deep having no bottom

To show his teeth as white as whale's bone

A spirit raised from depth of underground

Those friends thou hast and their adoption tried

Is it so sir

Desire him not to flatter with his lord

My life stands in the level of your dreams

When flesh is cheap and females dear

He prays but faintly and would be denied

And so in progress to be hatched and born

In your rich wisdom to excuse or hide

Farewell God knows when we shall meet again

Affection makes him false he speaks not true

And who but Rumor who but only I

Was never Scythia half so barbarous

And that thou thought'st thy griefs might equal mine

With hate in those where I expect most love

I care not if thou dost for me as much

By sea by sea

Sweetly in force unto her fair life's end

Here in my house do him disparagement

Of thinking too precisely on th' event

No din but snores about the house

And coasting homeward came to Ephesus

Whose wrongs in us God pardon did set forth

Some salve for perjury

Did urge me in his act I did inquire it

Was sent to by my brother one Lucio

My noble steed known to the camp I give him

Two thousand ducats by the year of land

That in your chambers gave you chastisement

Well could I bear that England had this praise

Why our authority is his consent

And never mayst thou come Lysander near

I humbly do entreat your Highness' pardon

The choice and master spirits of this age

But there is little reason in your grief

In me to lose

They say this town is full of cozenage

It must and shall be so Content thyself

O'ertake pursued success but I do feel

She was too fond of her most filthy bargain

First provost let me bail these gentle three

And all great fears which now import their dangers

I gave him gentle looks thereby to find

Olympus high and duck again as low

Or what did this bold enterprise bring forth

To be suspected framed to make women false

Their lips were four red roses on a stalk

Which false hope lingers in extremity

He loves me well and I have given him reasons

And in no worldly suits would he be moved

Royal king

This brave shall oft make thee to hide thy head

They are not constant but are changing still

Sans check to good and bad But when the planets

They have made worms' meat of me

How you delight my lords I know not I

Ay madam

From a full-flowing stomach

Myself am moved to woo thee for my wife

Excitements of my reason and my blood

The Cardinal's not my better in the field

It was about to speak when the cock crew

Why this should be I therefore vouch again

Do it without invention suddenly

And in this mist at all adventures go

Roderigo meant t' have sent this damn√®d villain

How dear a lover of my lord your husband

Cricket to Windsor chimneys shalt thou leap

My lords if not for any parts in him

Besides I fear me if thy thoughts were sifted

Murd'rous to th' senses That confirms it home

Make it a darling like your precious eye

That's something yet Edgar I nothing am

Myself have to mine own turned enemy

More than he haply may retail from me

In summer's drought I'll drop upon thee still

I will be sure my Katherine shall be fine

Lady were you her bedfellow last night

And yet she'll kneel and pray I have seen her do 't

But I might see young Cupid's fiery shaft

Nay then 'tis time to stir him from his trance

Anne Bullen No I'll no Anne Bullens for him

These that I bring unto their latest home

Cut me to pieces Volsces Men and lads

And pluck my magic garment from me

The seas waxed calm and we discover√®d

The way to dusty death Out out brief candle

The region of my breast which forced such way

Lizard's leg and howlet's wing

Sleeps in Elysium next day after dawn

Doth win immortal fame

What to delight in what to sorrow for

Being free from vainness and self-glorious pride

To Diana If thou be'st yet a fresh uncropp√®d flower

This is his pardon purchased by such sin

And their most reverend heads dashed to the walls

For such an injury would vex a very saint

One of these men is genius to the other

The sixth part of his substance to be levied

Ay that's my boy Thy father hath full oft

Their form confounded makes most form in mirth

Built up this city for his chiefest seat

And now Ventidius is wealthy too

Though tongues were out of use

And call upon my soul within the house

And ta'en I fear

If he could burn us all into one coal

Of what I spoke unpitied let me die

In your protectorship you did devise

That heaven had made her such a man She thanked me

And boding screech owls make the consort full

I have no way and therefore want no eyes

Who is Sylvia What is she

Ay my good lord

I know her spirits are as coy and wild

You are as fond of grief as of your child

This Jacob from our holy Abram was

Should presently extirpate me and mine

As first good company good wine good welcome

The action of good women There is hope

Whose salt imagination yet hath wronged

Her suit is now to repossess those lands

And let them be recalled from their exile

Made him give battle to the lioness

In courage courtship and proportion

To think an English courtier may be wise

O Dorset speak not to me Get thee gone

O was she so I must

Think us no churls nor measure our good minds

May it please your Highness to resolve me now

You strain too far

Cease gentle queen these execrations

Pinch him fairies mutually

Without the peril of the Athenian law

Let's see

I told you what would come of this Beseech you

These sentences to sugar or to gall

Lest I might anger thee

Which did incorporate and make us one

With Ringwood at thy heels

![](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8731/16451137303_d8ffa9576c.jpg)

Had he done so

And birds sit brooding in the snow

'Twas I that gave the kingdom to thy brother

The lees and dregs of a flat tam√®d piece

Do not believe him O behold this ring

I think I did sir I deny it not

![](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7716/16883745740_edeabb7300.jpg)

We cannot deal but with the very hand

Some six months since my lord

And if thy sons were ever dear to thee

My powers are crescent and my auguring hope

Two hundred ducats

I had rather crack my sinews break my back

From firm security

Richmond When last I was at Exeter

Our inland from the pilfering borderers

Alas for both both mine Edward and Clarence

Thou pitied'st Rutland I will pity thee

Accuse him home and home For my poor self

Like water from you never found again

That hath to instrument this lower world

And sweetly felt it

I will respect thee as a father if

Are hardly attained and hardly understood

That calls me traitor I return the lie

But knows of him no more My dearest madam

In face in gait in speech he doth resemble

Or to the place of difference call the swords

We have strict statutes and most biting laws

Upon his royal face there is no note

And to your shadow will I make true love

![](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7641/17071288065_e10913aaa2.jpg)

Were you a woman as the rest goes even

Which signifies what hate they bear their emperor

And great Troy shrieking

Unless I spake or looked or touched or carved to thee

Therefore begone solicit me no more

Not for that neither Here's the pang that pinches

![](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7717/17071288095_03cdbe1949.jpg)

Will praise a hand a foot a face an eye

And less than this I am sure you cannot give

The fresh-brook mussels withered roots and husks

Well let my deeds be witness of my worth

The mistress which I serve quickens what's dead

I will not resalute the streets of Rome

![](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7693/16863890207_f25a90df61.jpg)

'Tis an unseasoned courtier Good my lord

And he will make the face of heaven so fine

For had the passions of thy heart burst out

No lesser of her honor confident

Indeed his king to be engaged in Wales

His grandfather was Lionel Duke of Clarence

That metal that self mold that fashioned thee

Having been well that would have made me sick

And stood within the blank of his displeasure

That dogs bark at me as I halt by them

And since you know you cannot see yourself

I see no reason but supposed Lucentio

If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart

Master o' th' Jewel House

All comfort that the dark night can afford

I'll swear I am a maid and he knows not

A speedy power to encounter you my lord

![](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8784/17070540401_4f96f48590.jpg)

Any of these ways are yet better than this

Light seeking light doth light of light beguile

Under the covering of a careful night

Good my liege I come

Born to eclipse thy life this afternoon

O with what wings shall his affections fly

Hail gentle sir

And how shall we continue Claudio

For did I think thou wouldst not quickly die

Than that mixed in his cheek 'twas just the difference

Fire that's closest kept burns most of all

Like one I loved indeed What were thy friends

![](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8748/16883746370_9cc5b24514.jpg)

And for my sake stay here with Antony

It hath been taught us from the primal state

And such protest of pepper-gingerbread

So now fair prince of Troy I bid good night

Ay Timon and have cause

Some merry mocking lord belike Is 't so

To Lucio You sirrah that knew me for a fool a coward

Walk with Leonine The air is quick there

Who hath most fortunately been informed

I fight against thee No I will go seek

Bring me word how tall she is Pity me Charmian

Come we will all put forth body and goods

All you that see her that she were a maid

Be you content fair maid

Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it

During the wars of York and Lancaster

With juice of curs√®d hebona in a vial

God keep me from false friends but they were none

I weigh it lightly were it heavier

Hubert the utterance of a brace of tongues

For the deposing of a rightful king

To ears of flesh and blood List list O list

That gave 't surmis√®d shape Why then you princes

The will the will We will hear Caesar's will

My lord most villainously believe it

Perhaps is but prolonged Have patience and endure

Which daily she was bound to proffer This

Say to Ventidius I would speak with him

A privilege never to see me more

![](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8825/16885078049_cff684c8f4.jpg)

And sucked my verdure out on 't Thou attend'st not

Who dare cross 'em

If virtue's gloss will stain with any soil

Therefore thou best of gold art worst of gold

Perchance even there where I did find my doubts

Inhuman traitors you constrained and forced

I love to cope him in these sullen fits

You and your ways whose wraths to guard you from

Saying What lack you and Where lies your grief

First all you peers of Greece go to my tent

That beetles o'er his base into the sea

To give us warrant from the hand of God

![](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8763/17070540701_4101c65097.jpg)

Was there with him if I have heard a truth

And when she drinks against her lips I bob

Of this most pompous marriage feast

That from this castle's tottered battlements

And He that might the vantage best have took

To put him to ill thinking

Let each take some

Thus did he answer me yet said hereafter

Come come be everyone officious

For I am rightful heir unto the crown

Who died within the year of our redemption

Commune with you of this but rather follow

Ask him upon his oath if he does think

When we with tears parted Pentapolis

May in the sworn twelve have a thief or two

Gallow the very wanderers of the dark

And O you mortal engines whose rude throats

That makes her blood look out Good sooth she is

That ever I shall breathe

Give me some music Music plays Now good morrow friends

And simpler than the infancy of truth

When I dissuaded him from his intent

More than a wild exposure to each chance

But I can tell that in each grace of these

Have since miscarried under Bolingbroke

For blushing cheeks by faults are bred

Here go the desk the purse Sweet now make haste

Go I to make the French lay down their arms

Stand and go back

I am sorry they offend you heartily

My name is Caius Martius who hath done

Forever hous√®d where it gets possession

And for our eyes do hate the dire aspect

And what I want it boots not to complain

Which steals itself when there's no mercy left

When the false Trojan under sail was seen

Withdraw thee wretched Margaret Who comes here

Losing a mite a mountain gain

As she is troubled with thick-coming fancies

Fiend thou torments me ere I come to hell

And then with kind embracements tempting kisses

Both by myself and many other friends

Rebellion flat rebellion

To Aumerle Beshrew thee cousin which didst lead me forth

To fust in us unused Now whether it be

Being spoke behind your back than to your face

And drink it off and if you had the strength

Bid my guard watch Leave me

The paper as the body of my friend

You from the Polack wars and you from England

But yet is as a jailer to bring forth

And come you now to tell me John hath made

Be valiant and give signal to the fight

To fright them hence with that dread penalty

That she will light to listen to the lays

'Tis but a blow which never shall be known

Or bitterly to speak in your reproof

Yet needful too for youth no less becomes

Thy maiden sword

Nay task me to my word approve me lord

It was two ere I left him and now the clock strikes one

The icy precepts of respect but followed

Is daughter to this famous Duke of Milan

In states unborn and accents yet unknown

It was an answer How apply you this

And do thee favors with my royal hands

Caesar thou art revenged

The letter is too long by half a mile
