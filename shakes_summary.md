To an Attendant Sirrah call in my sons to be my bail

Of France and England did this king succeed

To say he'll turn your current in a ditch

If thou inclin'st that way thou art a coward

Ay such a pleasure as encagèd birds

I'll love no friend sith love breeds such offense

'Tis deepest winter in Lord Timon's purse

A very ribbon in the cap of youth

Or what you will command me will I do

Aloft the flood and can give audience

For young hot colts being reined do rage the more

What was the speech among the Londoners

His very air that I should call you brother

Time is their master and when they see time

My fairy lord this must be done with haste

Is thy news good or bad Answer to that

We scorn her most when most she offers blows

Marched through the city to the palace gates

And bear the palm for having bravely shed

Most like a soldier ordered honorably

Between the child and parent

And see how I regarded Caius Cassius

There shall he practice tilts and tournaments

But if you be afeard to hear the worst

That he hath given away Now by my life

Fall down before him like a mower's swath

![](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/255/18356263295_c5a62b7a7f.jpg)

And dip their napkins in his sacred blood

Beyond the mark of others Our then dictator

Make us strange stuff

I smell sweet savors and I feel soft things

John lays you plots The times conspire with you

Neither the King nor he that loves him best

Of thy success in love and what news else

Well more anon

Get me a ladder

As gaming my lord

I not purpose it

My fears forgetting manners to unfold

Joy and all comfort in your sacred breast

Thrice hath this Hotspur Mars in swaddling clothes

And in a word for far behind his worth

As firm as faith

And gave the tongue a helpful ornament

That trembles under his devouring paws

Another moon But O methinks how slow

That Sylvia is excelling

To take the safest occasion by the front

Glory is like a circle in the water

She hath had too much wrong and I repent

Yet let me obtain my wish

Hysterica passio down thou climbing sorrow

Thou wast their nurse they took thee for their mother

O jest unseen inscrutable invisible

Or never trust to what my tongue can do

Now by my hand lords 'twas a glorious day

Stand I before thee here Then if thou hast

![](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8823/17041230007_ba59245302.jpg)

Didst undertake it Why hast thou abused

Is loathsome in his own deliciousness

Saving your merry humor here's the note

That's not an office for a friend my lord

We have descried upon our neighboring shore

Besides the things that we have heard and seen

![](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7629/17062446639_9c60cfc368.jpg)

Doth make your honor of his body's hue

Either betrayed by falsehood of his guard

Art thou indeed

But Nature never framed a woman's heart

One hour's storm will drown the fragrant meads

Therefore I part with him and part with him

Our arms in strength of malice and our hearts

Happy in that we are not overhappy

O ceremony show me but thy worth

For such a business therefore am I found

Is by your fancies' thankful doom

Yea like the stag when snow the pasture sheets

Come good Lorenzo Fare you well a while

See that forthwith Duke Edward be conveyed

Nay you may think my love was crafty love

With hey ho the wind and the rain

Thy business

But love fair looks and true obedience

Torments will ope your lips

By the same token you are a bawd

A most poor issue

Nor tackle sail nor mast the very rats

Madam he swore that he did hold me dear

![](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8684/17247426151_c960780746.jpg)

How much unlike art thou to Portia

I am a lamb but if you brave the Moor

Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold

Or race of youthful and unhandled colts

Though Cassio did some little wrong to him

Abate thy valor in the acting it

![](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8744/16449194194_1586289bd8.jpg)

And I the mistress of your charms

Fair lords your fortunes are alike in all

In characters as red as Mars his heart

Stood on th' extremest verge of the swift brook

The heart of Antony Octavia is

The odds for high and low's alike

It goes on I see

You shall not now be stol'n you have locks upon you

Out some light horsemen and peruse their wings

The legate of the Pope hath been with me

Thy dangerous stoutness for I mock at death

When workmen strive to do better than well

That when I note another man like him

Your carriage from the court My noble mistress

'Tis meet that lucky ruler be employed

Reignier stand thou as Dauphin in my place

That makes these odds all even

Letting I dare not wait upon I would

You may not so extenuate his offense

And fall something into a slower method

And seeking death find life Let it come on

Drink the free air

Macbeth doth come

Falstaff will learn the humor of the age

Of what hath moved you

Like to the Empress' Moor Therefore I killed him

I am none by this good light

Suffolk concluded on the articles

It was myself my brother and his son

Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard

Roaring for Troilus who hath done today

More than I do except I be provoked

O would he did and so perhaps he doth

Nor the dejected havior of the visage

I am too blunt and saucy Here's my knee

Therefore Lord Constable haste on Montjoy

Lewis and the Lady Bona send to him

Which I mistrusted not Farewell therefore Hero

Now Kate I am a husband for your turn

Had we no other quarrel else to Rome but that

Will you go coz

And with his troops doth march amain to London

The armipotent Mars of lances the almighty

And give me swift transportance to those fields

The ladder made of cords and all the means

Against the Roman state whose course will on

Whose eyes are on this sovereign lady fixed

My lord I am guiltless as I am ignorant

I know him well You are welcome for his sake

No more a soldier Bruisèd pieces go

Or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite

And we are for the dark

The whole realm by your teaching and your chaplains'

But felt a fever of the mad and played

Where horses have been nimbler than the sands

![](https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5713/22010020495_64b219fb33.jpg)

Had virtuous uncles to protect his Grace

Her valiant courage and undaunted spirit

Whose care is gone before to bid us welcome

To this dead man than you shall see me pay

No more a Briton

Will close the eye of anguish

Drawing all things to it I'll go in and weep

And thee after when thou hast conquered

Feared by their breed and famous by their birth

Does give a life no shepherdess but Flora

Therefore stay yet Thou need'st not to be gone

Tyrannical power If he evade us there

Make them be strong and ready for this hint

Come from the country to be judged by you

In craving your opinion of my title

Of their dispatch

Though you in swearing shake the thronèd gods

And yet your fair discourse hath been as sugar

Though written in our flesh we shall remember

On Thursday sir The time is very short

The image of a wicked heinous fault

Stoop to the block than these knees bow to any

Could great men thunder

Most royal sir from thence from him whose daughter

Thou hast said enough

And in the calmest and most stillest night

Be brief lest that the process of thy kindness

'Tis holy sport to be a little vain

Is this the scourge of France

Dared once to touch a dust of England's ground

Remit thy other forfeits Take him to prison

Welcome fair one Is 't not a goodly presence

As surely as my soul intends to live

![](https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5794/21224628753_08e22cec58.jpg)

This is close dealing Well I will be there

To find this practice out

This union shall do more than battery can

Yea but not change his spots Take but my shame

I once more take my leave

That the great figure of a council frames

Tell him myself the Mayor and aldermen

Then mightst thou speak then mightst thou tear thy hair

That he hath used thee

When every case in law is right

Will you go with me We'll mend our dinner here

Of any true decision Nature craves

The spinsters and the knitters in the sun

By circumstance to curse thy cursèd self

How far off lie these armies

And I am nothing slow to slack his haste

![](https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5759/21657637500_bb58abc2ec.jpg)

Transformèd with their fear who swore they saw

And lay the summer's dust with showers of blood

A valiant Greek Aeneas take his hand

But all in vain are these mean obsequies

This toil of ours should be a work of thine

I know you not

![](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/734/21657639510_8dba35e89a.jpg)

To make him worthy whose offense subdues him

Where great patricians shall attend and shrug

Refuse you for my judge whom yet once more

And how the English have the suburbs won

The other three are sealing Octavia weeps

I do detest false perjured Proteus

Comes from my lord with letters

Into strong shudders and to heavenly agues

The heaviest and the worst

Methinks the realms of England France and Ireland

My mind exceeds the compass of her wheel

To rest without a spot forevermore

No no I am but shadow of myself

Here comes my man I think he brings the money

My grainèd ash an hundred times hath broke

Father I may not wish the fortune thine

Report the feature of Octavia her years

I am a stranger here in Gloucestershire

Then be your eyes the witness of their evil

Lead away

That thou art banishèd O that's the news

Shall this our lofty scene be acted over

To every several man seventy-five drachmas

Let Fortune go to hell for it not I

Take then thy bond take thou thy pound of flesh

I did say so

Against the part I come with so I'll die

She is a theme of honor and renown

I will my lord

Whose mind and mine I know in that are one

Off goes his bonnet to an oysterwench

While he enjoys the honor and his ease

Faith not me

Thou shalt not bail them See thou follow me

So do the kings of France unto this day

In the old time of war would shake the press

Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair

And his offense is so as it appears

Come Hamlet come and take this hand from me

He had been aboard carousing to his mates

How now fair lords What fare what news abroad

Madam by chance but not by truth What though

![](https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5678/21845714265_3224dbf694.jpg)

Now will he sit under a medlar tree

You are potently opposed and with a malice

I must then to the Grecians

In parcels as I did would have gone near

Hold your peaces

Let's see your piece

It was the owl that shrieked the fatal bellman

I hoped thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife

Yet I persuade myself to speak the truth

That being daily swallowed by men's eyes

By the o'ergrowth of some complexion

Ay me this object kills me

Yet tell her of it Hear what she will say

I warrant him Petruchio is Kated

In some large measure to thy father's death

A precious thing I had it from the Queen

But such as I without your special pardon

When means and lavish manners meet together

![](https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5669/21224668963_3cbaabc966.jpg)

That touches this my firstborn son and heir

And I must minister the like to you

As if besmeared in hell Sit by us You shall hear

Let it presage the ruin of your love

A private whisper no not with such friends

To who my lord

![](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/617/21657872938_beca4303cc.jpg)

And for thy treachery what's more manifest

Softer and sweeter than the lustful bed

Although assailed with fortune fierce and keen

O name him not Let us not break with him

But heaven hath a hand in these events

Flies where you bid it I find that she which late

![](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/569/21657875388_8ba3444e52.jpg)

What does this mean my lord

Or die renownèd by attempting it

Art thou proud yet

A maid And be so martial

Know that tomorrow the last of many battles

I am full sorry

![](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/619/21855330541_a8fa2615cd.jpg)

Which sleeps and never palates more the dung

And hardly keeps his men from mutiny

That matter needless of importless burden

Dost thou say so

The praisèd of the King who so ennobled

And if thou vanquishest thy words are true

You see how easily she may be surprised

Nay temperately Your promise

Were never orphans had so dear a loss

And when it bows stand'st up Thou art left Martius

The sixth part of his substance to be levied

With nimble soles I have a soul of lead

Well begun Tranio

He that conceals him death

And he himself confessed it but even now

And say what store of parting tears were shed

I your commission will forthwith dispatch

Your honor not o'erthrown by your desires

Sleep she as sound as careless infancy

Thanks noble peer

Do Caesar what he can Know sir that I

The air bites shrewdly it is very cold

Flock to the rebels and their power grows strong

I thought you lord of more true gentleness

![](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/594/21833860672_dda305f1fe.jpg)

If not I'll use the advantage of my power

You do but lose your labor

Be wary then best safety lies in fear

But the main article I do approve

To o'erthrow law and in one self-born hour

Ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond

![](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/683/21658865129_27d52105b1.jpg)

And wrangle with my reason that persuades me

All's well and might have been much better if

'Tis a villain sir

Which with my scimitar I'll cool tomorrow

I do forgive thee

Ere stay behind this business

That most are willing If any such be here

That every braggart shall be found an ass

Nay I do bear a brain But as I said

Why are we met in council

This is too much

I hear their drums Let's set our men in order

Are your doors locked

And these two Dromios one in semblance

Is the obedience to a master one

No not a whit What I have watched ere now

Giving no ground unto the house of York

Who dazzling so that eye shall be his heed

Or stones whose rate are either rich or poor

Even to their ships

For Gloucester's dukedom is too ominous

And does he send to me Three Humh

Let shame come when it will I do not call it

That you can let this go Are you so gospeled

We pray with heart and soul and all beside

As flowers with frost or grass beat down with storms

I saw him hold acquaintance with the waves

The which if He be pleased I shall perform

Must wear the print of his remembrance on 't

Why only Suffolk mourn I not for thee

Use us and it My good lord have great care

That Tiber trembled underneath her banks

That will I should I die the hour after

The King grown bankrupt like a broken man

Took off her life this and what needful else

When he was here

Your knees to them not arms must help Alack

I have a mind to strike thee ere thou speak'st

Durst thou have looked upon him being awake

All the particulars of vice so grafted

Or it hath drawn me rather But 'tis gone

Let me go in to see the Generals

Here comes the townsmen on procession

So long as I could see

That well by heart hath conned his embassage

You know the very road into his kindness

To play till Doomsday Bring our crown and all

'Tis said man and farewell

So deal with him as I prove true to you

And every day that comes comes to decay

Lock up my doors and when you hear the drum

Soon may I hear and see him

That raught at mountains with outstretchèd arms

And let them work The nature of our people

And there will we be too ere it be long

For thy part I do wish thou wert a dog

And woo her with some spirit when she comes

Even as her appetite shall play the god

Let me be recorded by the righteous gods

That shall be scoured in his rancorous heart

O God which this blood mad'st revenge his death

Thy country's strength and weakness thine own ways

You promised when you parted with the King

Which is indeed but sign That you shall surely find him

So stinkingly depending Go mend go mend

My lord

When I am absent then lie with my wife

![](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/683/20474195303_067f3f3683.jpg)

Pull off my boots Harder harder So

And will she yet abase her eyes on me

Although thy husband may be Menelaus

Such as she said my lord did say I was

He's never anything but your true servant

A losing suit against him Are you answered

![](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/651/20472655464_7000d3143d.jpg)

But if you fail without more speech my lord

Go give 'em welcome you can speak the French tongue

An armor all of gold It was a king's

Better than he have worn Vulcan's badge

And I to Page shall eke unfold

As like enough it will I would have it copied

![](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/643/20908473309_0a4802b566.jpg)

Nobler than my revolt is infamous

Judge me the world if 'tis not gross in sense

Turn thou the mouth of thy artillery

Since this fortune falls to you

Strong both against the deed then as his host

To come and sport Her peacocks fly amain

O now you look like Hubert All this while

What kind of my obedience I should tender

When evil deeds have their permissive pass

Now show yourselves men 'Tis for liberty

I am with child you bloody homicides

Mars what it does yea very force entangles

![](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/725/20472658934_553a0c3b24.jpg)

Now for the counsel of my son and queen

As new into the world strange unacquainted

But Ajax is their fool

This is the pearl that pleased your empress' eye

Withdraw thee wretched Margaret Who comes here

Methinks I see these things with parted eye

![](https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5697/21069084686_9ed471bb90.jpg)

For what they have been 'Tis a cruelty

Full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights

No doubt no doubt and so shall Clarence too

Your dangerous lenity If you are learned

March sadly after Grace my mournings here

There lurks a still and dumb-discursive devil

![](https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5806/20474201143_70272698b1.jpg)

And never see the Louvre

Here I'll make

Yea let them say to stick the heart of falsehood

There is no hope that ever I will stay

I gained my freedom and immediately

Thy own wish wish I thee in every place

Let us Lepidus not lack your company

To know your royal pleasure

See Buckingham Somerset comes with th' Queen

Blush for pure shame to counterfeit our roses

No How might a prince of my great hopes forget

Most sure she was

Who is 't that can inform me

Farewell my Desdemona I'll come to thee straight

I promise you my lord you moved me much

This is the matter Nurse give leave awhile

And the ill counsel of a desert place

By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn

![](https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5698/21069088636_4cd772e004.jpg)

I am the last that will last keep his oath

Now happy he whose cloak and cincture can

My staff Here noble Henry is my staff

Free from oppression or the stroke of war

The more delayed delighted Be content

Not hold thee of our blood no not our kin

Brother farewell I will unto the King

Go seek him Tell him I would speak with him

Before I strike this bloody stroke farewell

Being held a foe he may not have access

![](https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5729/21069090866_74802bcda6.jpg)

I know that we shall have him well to friend

That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you

As good to wink sweet love as look on night

'Tis to be feared they all will follow him

An elder than herself So wears she to him

Doth make the night joint laborer with the day

![](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/665/21095238375_6de42a7ffd.jpg)

To send such peevish tokens to a king

To cool a gypsy's lust

My dismal scene I needs must act alone

That you express content which we will pay

My lord I did

Before the gods my knee shall bow my prayers

![](https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5718/21102979441_baf7389299.jpg)

Rub him about the temples

Upon our fail To this point hast thou heard him

God for Thy mercy they are loose again

Thy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee

And burn him with their tapers

Humbly complaining to her Deity

Fair one I think not so

The gods withhold me

My Lord Sands

First note that he is near you in descent

For they have fought for Rome and all in vain

If thou dar'st bring them to the baiting place

But tell the traitor in the highest degree

While he did bear my countenance in the town

Gave you a dancing rapier by your side

If not he foams at mouth and by and by

That it was he in the times past which held you

With all the learnèd council of the realm

Blow off thy cap praise his most vicious strain

The hours come back That did I never hear

Agree these deeds with that proud brag of thine

When service should in my old limbs lie lame

This man with lantern dog and bush of thorn

But to be free and bounteous to her mind

Sir Stephen Scroop besides a clergyman

Tapers they are with your sweet breaths puffed out

That might relieve you

This bud of love by summer's ripening breath

I see sir you have found the goldsmith now

Give answer to this boy and do it freely

And in part him but you may say not well

Off with the crown and with the crown his head

Good night mother

Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause

Thou showest the naked pathway to thy life

At seventeen years many their fortunes seek

Make way to lay them by their brethren

Every good servant does not all commands

And prove the period of their tyranny

Thy valor and thy heart thou art a traitor

Even in the bosom of our adversaries

All these well furnished by the Duke of Brittany

Sir you speak nobly

Where is thy head Where's that Ay me where's that

Than your particular demands will touch it

Unless some fit or frenzy do possess her

With modest warrant

Nestor-like agèd in an age of care

So it may prove an argument of laughter

Alack 'tis he Why he was met even now

Or voluntary dotage of some mistress

Why sigh'st thou without breaking

And yet in substance and authority

Three civil brawls bred of an airy word

I'll haunt thee like a wicked conscience still

Hang in the air a thousand leagues from hence

Heaven guard my mother's honor and my land

Grandam we can for my good uncle Gloucester

Was made much poorer by it But your son

But the plain single vow that is vowed true

As happy prologues to the swelling act

Thus far into the bowels of the land

'Tis all my business At our last encounter

And very wisely threat before you sting

Up to a whore who now are levying

Such pity as my rapier's point affords

Commend me to your master and the cap

Covering discretion with a coat of folly

Ah barbarous villains Hath this lovely face

He'd make an end of thy posterity

Too long a pause for that which you find there

And she to him to stay him not too long

But since thou lov'st love still and thrive therein

Hadst thou but shook thy head or made a pause

To many a watchful night Sleep with it now

Take him away He knows I know him well

See as thou wast wont to see

That thus delays my promisèd supply

Th' unsatiate greediness of his desire

Jog on jog on the footpath way

I'll lend it thee my dear but have no power

What I can help thee to thou shalt not miss

Where a malignant and a turbanned Turk

And so inflict our province Yet once more

And like her most whose merit most shall be

But time hath rooted out my parentage

No take more

And fall thy edgeless sword Despair and die

Alack the day she's dead she's dead she's dead

It is my office and madam pardon me

O if to fight for king and commonweal

Good night and welcome both at once to those

You never shall so help you truth and God

Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus

'Gainst us our state our subjects or our land

But is he often thus

The King is in high rage

Hath in the table of His law commanded

Unless to see my shadow in the sun

Side-stitches that shall pen thy breath up Urchins

Justice to break her sword He kisses her One more one more

Wilt thou change fathers I will give thee mine

Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear

To pay him tribute and submit thyself

She is a gallant creature and complete

To counsel deaf but not to flattery

From miserable slumber I awaked

For his right noble mind illustrious virtue

That valiant Clifford with his rapier's point

That is her love for that is all in all

Though it do well I do not relish well

No king of England if not king of France

That the lover sick to death

Not mad but mated how I do not know

By ruffian lust should be contaminate

Antony's course you shall bereave yourself

Patroclus' wounds have roused his drowsy blood

Who dares do more is none

Conformable as other household Kates

My eyes my lord can look as swift as yours

My shame and guilt confounds me

And am I guerdoned at the last with shame

Deadly divorce step between me and you

That keeps you in the house and not your own

Though well we may not pass upon his life

And then from hour to hour we rot and rot

My good lord Archbishop I'm very sorry

But sir to love concerneth us to add

Whereof I shall not have intelligence

And yet I warrant it had upon its brow

The seas and winds old wranglers took a truce

So well as Brutus living but will follow

On me my bargains and my well-won thrift

Thinking on them go I unto the Tower

You breathe these dead news in as dead an ear

A good knave i' faith and well fed

Before a willing bondman then I know

Stared each on other and looked deadly pale

No marrying 'mong his subjects

Of these most strange events

Unless abroad they purchase great alliance

If you be well pleased with this

That's not so good now

And more diversity of sounds all horrible

O that I were a glove upon that hand

Their preparation is today by sea

For doing these fair rites of tenderness

Therefore thou sleep'st so sound

A grievous fault Say woman didst thou so

By us a pair of kings Let's from this place

You must forget to be a woman change

Should sure to the slaughter

As I stood here below methought his eyes

Given to captivity me and my utmost hopes

We cannot miss him He does make our fire

Never to woo her more but do forswear her

Look thorough a casement to allure false hearts

Not sorting with a nuptial ceremony

This murder had not come into my mind

And sure those men are happy that shall have 'em

Three else of Cyprus noble swelling spirits

Is this the promise that you made your mother

What plain proceedings is more plain than this

If we be conquered let men conquer us

Deep malice makes too deep incision

Beck'ning with fiery truncheon my retire

And bind the boy which you shall find with me

Nephew what means this passionate discourse

But creep in crannies when he hides his beams

His bruisèd helmet and his bended sword

The shame hereof will make me hide my head

With needless jealousy

Some other time for that Belovèd Regan

And he my husband best of all affects

Is it e'en so Why then I thank you all

Here comes the townsmen on procession

Revenged may she be on that hateful duke

Why then good morrow to you all my lords

And therefore little shall I grace my cause

And you but waste your words

A plot shall show us all a merry day

We'll quickly rouse the traitors in the same

Which lay nice manners by I put you to

Than by concealing it heap on your head

Examine every married lineament

He is franked up to fatting for his pains

Nay rather good my lords be second to me

Make fearful musters and prepared defense

Then westward ho

Must I go like a traitor thither

In such another trick Go bring the rabble

Upon the naked shore at Ravenspurgh

Melodious birds sings madrigals

No that you shall not till you take her hand

By that same god what god soe'er it be

Who neighed so high that what I would have spoke

Holding thy ear close to the hollow ground

Still climbing trees in the Hesperides

What's the matter

My liege

Disguisèd cheaters prating mountebanks

Tailor I'll pay thee for thy gown tomorrow

Dismiss your followers and as suitors should

Then you belike suspect these noblemen

Upon your favors swims with fins of lead

Why so I am in mind and that's enough

Yet one word more Grief boundeth where it falls

Look here he comes

And in such eyes as ours appear not faults

Came here to make us merry And thou hast killed him

Might eas'liest harbor in Thou blessèd thing

Silence good mother Hear the embassy

And stain my favors in a bloody mask

Which but their children's end naught could remove

Prithee call Gardiner to me my new secretary

Springs not from Edward's well-meant honest love

But good my lord do it so cunningly

And come again to me who on my life

Being our kinsman if we revel much

Will yield to see his daughter

The seat of Gaunt dukedom of Lancaster

Lie hid more thousand deaths yet death we fear

Thou hast one son for his sake pity me

Seeking out Romeo that did spit his body

Ay

That is removèd by a staff of France

Nothing of that shall from mine eyes appear

Lost he his other eye

But from her need

My lord I hold my life as dear as you do yours

And though she be but little she is fierce

Or I shall say you're all in all in spleen

Do we but find the tyrant's power tonight

Have vanquished the resistance of her youth

Which mates him first that first intends deceit

And in thy best consideration check

Should with a bond of air strong as the axletree

Who loved her so that speaking of her foulness

Here sir a ring she bid me give you sir

The story of that baleful burning night

![](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/281/19708697280_fea4a6a953.jpg)

Should have gone off

I hear the news my lord

Yet I am none Whose tongue soe'er speaks false

What thou hast done thy master Caesar knows

He shall not die so much we tender him

The hard and soft seem all affined and kin

You shall have me assisting you in all

Full surfeits and the dryness of his bones

Peace willful boy or I will charm your tongue

Is in the very May-morn of his youth

May give you thankful sacrifice

If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help

How goes it with my brave Mark Antony

Beloved of me and that my deeds shall prove

Of Lucius son to old Andronicus

You and your fellows I'd have it come to question

Restored me to my honors and out of ruins

Nay but hear me

Which then he wore The snatches in his voice

And now be it known to you my full intent

But let him swear so and he shall not stay

Do feel the treason sharply yet the traitor

Until the Queen his mistress bury it

No no But all this did I know before

Such a compounded one

O'erprized all popular rate in my false brother

Hoping you'll find good cause to whip them all

Who hearing of our Martius' banishment

Taking advantage of our misery

A lullaby too rough I never saw

That covenants may be kept on either hand

Honor and policy like unsevered friends

I pray greet him fairly

All dues be rendered to their owners Now

And I am witness with her that she did

Which to maintain I would allow him odds

I say my lord that if I were a man

But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them

![](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/449/19343809009_fe85180be6.jpg)

Further I say and further will maintain

That hath dishonored all our family

It shall be seven ere I go to horse

I have a speech o' fire that fain would blaze

A way if it take right in spite of fortune

Will you indeed

To speak unto this city What say you

A foutre for the world and worldlings base

Our nation's terror and their bloody scourge

O coward that I am to live so long

This little one shall make it holiday

That heaven hath infused them with these spirits

Sent from our uncle Duke of Burgundy

I am a poor fall'n man unworthy now

I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes

Than thine own gladness that thou art employed

Rapine and Murder you are welcome too

Yet never have you tasted our reward

And having France thy friend thou shalt not dread

I doubt not but this populous city

Find him my Lord of Warwick Chide him hither

I am not warm yet Let us fight again

Almost no grave allowed me like the lily

Which of your hands hath not defended Rome

![](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/374/18909438393_760c1b8e0f.jpg)

Each corporal agent to this terrible feat

Which his hell-governed arm hath butcherèd

Ay 'twas he that told me on her first

Then both or one or any thing thou wilt

Heard you of nothing strange about the streets

We would as willingly give cure as know

![](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/434/19504197906_394b9c1430.jpg)

Who worship dirty gods

Shall we upon the footing of our land

Yes sir to Milford Haven Which is the way

Warwick may lose that now hath won the day

They'll be in fresher robes or they will pluck

Who dazzling so that eye shall be his heed

![](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/359/19523627812_2f2318e2de.jpg)

Good morrow cousin

Partly for that her promisèd proportions

T' incur a private check When shall he come

Since we have locks to safeguard necessaries

I would we had a thousand Roman dames

For him I imitate O if it prove

![](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/448/19534554911_21c30d9d73.jpg)

There's not the smallest orb which thou behold'st

Why uncle what's the matter

So perfect and so peerless are created

And show me to the shouting varletry

With his own sword

The worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold

Seeking the bubble reputation

Of regular justice in your city's bounds

Argues your wisdoms and your love to Richard

Held me in chase that I was forced to wheel

To visit other places and come down

For exile hath more terror in his look

![](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/329/19530306605_5146707a06.jpg)

To hold your hand more close I did endure

I have news to tell you Come come give me your hand

To bear my lady's train lest the base earth

That's paragoned o' th' world

Was the Hero that here lies

The chafèd boar the mountain lioness

![](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/372/19343810699_391fd44565.jpg)

Let me see a fat l'envoi ay that's a fat goose

From action and adventure

The Duke of Suffolk is the first and claims

Mistress what's your opinion of your sister

Will 't please you go my lord

When could they say till now that talked of Rome

![](https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3787/19523628032_78a6140ef7.jpg)

To do this deed will hate you for the deed

My dearest cousin and my dearer lord

I dare avouch it sir What fifty followers

On what condition stands it and wherein

My lips two blushing pilgrims ready stand

He likewise gives a frock or livery

![](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/367/19342380550_aed8101918.jpg)

I speak in understanding Y' are I know 't

Which if thou hast considered let us know

Must fill or else my project fails

No yet time serves wherein you may redeem

And keep it from the Earth

And she to him to stay him not too long

![](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/289/19523628312_ba37ac08ba.jpg)

Take thou some of it and seek through this grove

That sticks on filthy deeds

Yes when his holy state is touched so near

Sticking together in calamity

With slow but stately pace kept on his course

Though I do hate him as I do hell pains

![](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/511/18907793994_f7a6196e3d.jpg)

As if he had been loosèd out of hell

Hence will I to my ghostly friar's close cell

The lass I spoke of

The best news is that we have safely found

Without the which I am not to be won

With him his bondman all as mad as he

![](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/464/19342379848_6ced0b9c6f.jpg)

That spanieled me at heels to whom I gave

A soul as even as a calm Pray think us

Hear his speech but say thou naught

Then have my lips the sin that they have took

As if he were forgot and princes all

I have served you ever since I was a child

![](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/536/19343811819_c891aa25d6.jpg)

Am I in France

And telling me the sovereignest thing on Earth

Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow

Vanish or I shall give thee thy deserving

Which tells in that glory once he was

From forth thy reach he would have laid thy shame

![](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/534/18909440873_db54ee39d9.jpg)

As they us to our trenches Follow 's

We'll not commend that not intend to sell

Fast foe to th' plebeii your voices might

Engage it to the trial if thou dar'st

He'll never hear him

Or what his death will bring us

![](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/280/19504200356_ce8d581c46.jpg)

Arm you I pray you to this speedy voyage

To rob me of so rich a bottom here

That thou may'st shake the superflux to them

I'll mark no words that smooth-faced wooers say

O a pit of clay for to be made

As easy as a down bed would afford it

![](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/316/19504200716_3d1da33bb3.jpg)

The man shall have his mare again and all shall be well

His daughter's trial that he did but see

My cracked one to more care Have with you boys

Which sixteen winters cannot blow away

For she is with me No when light-winged toys

Be used more thankfully In himself 'tis much

![](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/316/19504200896_c5d1fb809f.jpg)

But that I cannot do ten thousand more

We will attend to neither

There's letters sealed and my two schoolfellows

Nothing goes right We would and we would not

The great prerogative and rite of love

And shalt be ever

![](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/397/19534557611_482bfdcc68.jpg)

How blow How blow Speak to be understood

The other eye of Gloucester

Stand aside The noise they make

Just the contrary the better for thy friends

A murderer and a villain

And that hath dazzled my reason's light

![](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/396/19504201626_d270726545.jpg)

Pale or red

Draw near you people

That the poor soldier that so richly fought

I have lost my hopes

With drunken spilth of wine when every room

There Diomed doth feast with him tonight

![](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/562/19534558331_6280f2386c.jpg)

The King is mad How stiff is my vile sense

Uplift us to the view In their thick breaths

And snatch them straight away We here below

And shame thine honorable age with blood

But in what nature

To one You have work for me There's payment Hence

![](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/467/19342382690_c16eeb6638.jpg)

Begun through malice of the Bishop's men

Ay madam twenty several messengers

As next the King he was successive heir

The more of you 'twas felt the more it shaped

Come my fair Cordelia

Lie in a pitched field
